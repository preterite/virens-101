## Design Rationale

VIRENS 101 operates with two complementary frameworks for understanding writing work: **process pedagogy** (the established composition tradition) and **six moves** (an information-flow model adapted from digital knowledge management). These frameworks are not competing explanations but complementary levels of description.

**Process pedagogy** describes what human writers do: generative writing, drafting, seeking feedback, revising, editing, proofreading, publishing, reflecting. The agent is the writer; the grammar is active; the orientation is toward completing compositions.

**Six moves** describes what happens to information as writers work: capture, classify, route, connect, distill, publish. The agent is the material itself; the grammar describes transformation; the orientation is toward building infrastructure that accumulates value over time.

Both frameworks operate simultaneously. A writer is always doing process work; their material is always moving through six-move phases. The pedagogical challenge is helping students recognize and work within both levels—understanding their labor as writers AND understanding how that labor builds into reusable intellectual capital.

### The Mill and Store Metaphor

Charles Babbage's distinction between "mill" (where computation happens) and "store" (where values accumulate) provides a useful spatial metaphor:

- **The mill** is where transformation occurs—efficient operations on material. Six moves are mill operations: capturing, classifying, routing, distilling, connecting, publishing.
- **The store** is where abundance accumulates—the corpus, the archive, the portfolio. Complexity-as-muchness lives here.
- **Process pedagogy** describes a writer working between mill and store: pulling from accumulated capital, laboring on it, depositing new capital back.

The mill is always within the store, not separate from it. Every writing session involves both drawing from accumulated material and depositing new material for future use.

## Theoretical Grounding

### Composition Pedagogy

The process tradition (Murray, Elbow, Flower & Hayes) established that writing is recursive, not linear—writers move back and forth through stages rather than proceeding lock-step from invention to publication. VIRENS 101 inherits this insight but extends it: recursion happens not just within a single composition but across compositions over time. Today's fragment becomes next month's paragraph; this semester's exploratory writing becomes next year's thesis chapter.

**Key process concepts retained:**
- Recursion and non-linearity
- Separation of generative/developmental work from editorial work
- Feedback as information, not command
- Revision as re-seeing, not merely correcting
- Reflection as required metacognitive stage

**Extensions via six moves:**
- Explicit infrastructure for accumulation (the store)
- Named operations for information transformation (the mill)
- Constraint sequencing as pedagogical principle
- Capital/labor dialectic made visible

Nancy Sommers's research on student versus experienced revisers supports the framework distinction: novice writers often treat revision as editing (surface correction) rather than reconception. Six moves helps separate these operations by making "distill" (compression, clarification) distinct from "connect" (relation, reconception). Students learn that making a fragment denser is different from changing how it relates to other fragments.

### Systems/Design Thinking

The six moves framework emerges from knowledge management practice (zettelkasten, Obsidian, personal knowledge management communities) but connects to broader systems thinking:

**Donella Meadows** on leverage points: Small interventions in the right places (routing decisions, classification choices) propagate through systems. Teaching students to route material deliberately—rather than dumping everything in one folder—is a leverage-point intervention.

**Christopher Alexander** on pattern languages: Six moves function as a pattern language for information work. Each move is a named, repeatable solution to a recurring problem. Students learn to recognize "I need to capture this" or "this needs connecting" as situations calling for particular responses.

**Fred Brooks** on conceptual integrity: A system with too many paradigms becomes incoherent. Six moves provides conceptual integrity for information flow; process pedagogy provides conceptual integrity for human agency. The two frameworks are small enough to hold in mind simultaneously without confusion.

### Economic Framework: Labor, Capital, and Value Appropriation

The course's deeper theoretical commitment draws on Marxian economic analysis, specifically:

- **Writing-as-verb (labor)**: The work of composing, the expenditure of effort and attention
- **Writing-as-noun (capital)**: Accumulated texts that can be stored, retrieved, recombined, and reinvested

The value appropriation cycle—production, distribution, use, reproduction—describes how texts circulate. Crucially, this is not capitalist extraction but **self-appropriation**: students build infrastructure so they benefit from their own past labor. Education operates as a non-market form of value circulation; citation functions as gift economy; accumulated fragments are intellectual savings, not alienated labor.

This framing counters the "grind culture" interpretation of efficiency. The point of efficient information operations (six moves) is not extracting maximum output from minimum input, but ensuring that past labor remains available for future work. The corpus accumulates; nothing is wasted; intellectual productivity compounds.

### Rhetorical Tradition

The six moves map onto classical rhetorical canons, with significant extensions:

| Six Move | Classical Canon | Extension |
|----------|----------------|-----------|
| Capture | Invention | Reading-as-generation; external input enters system |
| Classify | (implicit in Arrangement) | Foregrounded as explicit operation |
| Route | Delivery | Reconceived as protocol across time, not just publication moment; includes kairos as procedural habit |
| Distill | Style | Compression and clarification at fragment level |
| Connect | Memory | Externalized into citation, hyperlink, database; the memory palace becomes the corpus |
| Publish | Delivery | Entry into circulation; beginning of reception, not end of composition |

**Route** deserves particular attention. Classical delivery addressed "to audience at publication." Route reconceives delivery as happening at multiple moments: routing information from citation to fragment, from fragment to draft, from draft to reviewer, from reviewer feedback back into the system. Route adds kairos—timeliness and situational appropriateness—as procedural habit. It applies to constraint as well as text: routing constraint early opens possibility later.

**Connect** represents the most significant extension of classical rhetoric. For the ancients, connection could only happen post-delivery because of their infrastructures and technologies. The cathedral, the codex, footnotes, citation—later technologies enabled connection in ways the ancients could not imagine. But the classical memory canon was always about connection: placing items in relation for retrieval and recombination. Obsidian and similar tools revise and expand the connective capacities of the monk's internal memory palace, partly by shifting constraint (templates, directories, metadata) to the foreground in order to open possibilities for investigation and retrieval later.

### Edbauer's Ecology, Reconceived as Economy

Jenny Edbauer (Rice)'s rhetorical ecology work provides a model for scale-shifting: moving from the semester-bound composition classroom to larger cycles of academic circulation. VIRENS 101 adapts this move but shifts the governing metaphor from **ecology** (resource flows over place) to **economy** (value flows over time).

The economic metaphor better captures:
- **Accumulation**: Texts accrue value as corpus grows
- **Circulation**: Citation-as-vector moves ideas through systems
- **Investment and return**: Past labor pays dividends in future work
- **Multiple scales of operation**: Citation works internally (VIRENS routing for human efficiency) and externally (scholarly citation for disciplinary circulation)

## Implementation Approach

### Teaching Sequence

The frameworks enter the course at different moments, following constraint-sequencing principles:

**Weeks 1-3 (Movement 1: Surfacing)**: Process vocabulary introduced first because students have some familiarity with "drafting," "revision," etc. Six moves introduced as what's happening to their index cards—capture, classify, route—without full theoretical elaboration.

**Weeks 4-7 (Movement 2: Naming)**: Six moves vocabulary becomes explicit as students name their own practices. The relationship between process (what you do) and six moves (what your material does) is articulated.

**Weeks 8-11 (Movement 3: Operating at Scale)**: The mill/store metaphor introduced as students transfer analog systems to digital. Economic framing (labor, capital, value accumulation) becomes available.

**Weeks 12-15 (Movement 4: Synthesis)**: Both frameworks available for portfolio reflection. Students can analyze their own work using either or both vocabularies.

### The Scale-Shift Pedagogical Move

A core teaching move performs scale-shifting: "What you just did with index cards is the same thing Blizzard does for game development, the same thing Marvel does for the Cinematic Universe, the same thing you could do for a dissertation." The six moves are not just course procedures but transferable habits for knowledge work.

The scale-shift operates in two directions:
1. **Local to abstract**: This specific card-sorting activity instantiates general principles
2. **Episode to cycle**: This isn't a one-time process but a repeating cycle—production, distribution, use, reproduction, back to production

### Mapping Process Stages to Six Moves

For instructor reference, a rough mapping:

| Process Stage | Six Moves Involved | What's Happening |
|---------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Generative writing | Capture | Ideas enter material form |
| Drafting | Route, Connect | Fragments move into composition, relate to each other |
| Seeking feedback | (social input) | External information enters system |
| Incorporating feedback | Capture, Classify | Feedback becomes material to route |
| Revising | Connect, (re-)Distill | Changing relations, reconceiving |
| Editing | Distill | Sentence-level compression and clarity |
| Proofreading | (preparation for Publish) | Surface-level readiness |
| Publishing | Publish | Entry into circulation |
| Reflecting | Capture (of process knowledge) | Meta-level capture for future cycles |

**Note**: Classify operates throughout and doesn't map cleanly to a single process stage—it's the ongoing work of naming what kind of thing something is.

## Competing Values & Tradeoffs

### Efficiency vs. Complexity

**The tension**: Six moves are oriented toward efficient information movement. Process pedagogy often deliberately resists efficiency: "Wait, let's complicate that." Revision expands, qualifies, investigates complexity. Distillation feels reductive where revision can be expansive.

**The resolution**: Efficiency in infrastructure enables complexity in composition. Well-routed, well-connected distillations make possible the revision work of expansion and complication. You can only complicate productively if you can find what you've already thought. The store must be full (muchness, abundance) before the mill's efficiency pays off.

**Pedagogical implication**: Never present six moves as demanding that students reduce everything to bullet points. Distilled fragments enable complex compositions; they don't replace them.

### Individual vs. Social

**The tension**: Six moves describes information flow without foregrounding the social. Process pedagogy's feedback stage is explicitly collaborative. Does six moves risk making writing feel solitary?

**The resolution**: Connect carries the social. Students connect not just to their own fragments but to peer fragments (in feedback), to scholarly conversation (via citation), to course readings (via BEAM tagging). Publication is entry into circulation, which is inherently social. The social is always already present in capture (capturing others' ideas) and publish (entering others' attention).

**Pedagogical implication**: Frame connect explicitly as including connection to other people's thinking, not just your own archive.

### Procedural vs. Dispositional

**The tension**: Both frameworks blur between specific instructions (capture this, revise that draft) and general habits (be someone who captures, be someone who revises). Students may treat them as IKEA assembly instructions rather than developing flexible dispositions.

**The resolution**: Name the blur explicitly. "Here's what you do today; here's the habit you're building." The three meanings of "writing process" (reductive teaching model, complex assemblage, personal matrix of experience) apply equally to six moves.

**Pedagogical implication**: Regular metacognitive prompts asking students to identify which move or stage they're in, building awareness of their own patterns.

### Borrowed Vocabulary

**The tension**: "Distill" comes from zettelkasten and personal knowledge management communities. It carries connotations (atomic notes, permanent notes, evergreen notes) that may not serve first-year writers.

**The resolution**: Use "distill" but define it operationally: "Extract the essential insight; make it denser and clearer." Avoid zettelkasten jargon (no "permanent notes," no "slip-box") in favor of accessible equivalents. If a better term emerges from teaching, replace it.

**Alternative candidates considered**: crystallize (suggests clarity but perhaps too precious), concentrate (chemical/economic), compress (too mechanical), refine (closer to process but perhaps too genteel).

## Evidence & Iteration

### Evidence to Collect

- [ ] Can students articulate the difference between process (their work) and six moves (their material's journey) by Week 7?
- [ ] Do development logs show students naming their own moves/stages accurately?
- [ ] In portfolio reflections, do students use both vocabularies productively?
- [ ] Do students demonstrate scale-shifting—applying framework concepts to contexts beyond the course?
- [ ] Does the efficiency/complexity framing reduce student anxiety about "doing it right"?

### Revision Notes

[Space for post-pilot observations]

- Watch for: students treating six moves as linear sequence rather than recursive operations
- Watch for: process stages and six moves becoming confused rather than complementary
- Watch for: economic framing feeling alienating rather than empowering (adjust labor/capital language if needed)
