## Design Philosophy

### Core Pedagogical Principle

Students benefit from a shared vocabulary for naming writing processes. The six-moves framework—**capture, classify, route, distill, connect, publish**—provides students with precise language for metacognitive awareness of their composing practices. This vocabulary bridges composition pedagogy's emphasis on process with systems thinking's emphasis on workflow design.

### Theoretical Grounding

**Key Sources:**
- Flower, Linda and John Hayes. "A Cognitive Process Theory of Writing" (metacognitive awareness of writing processes)
- Yancey, Kathleen Blake. *Reflection in the Writing Classroom* (naming practices enables reflection)
- Berkenkotter, Carol and Thomas Huckin. *Genre Knowledge in Disciplinary Communication* (tacit knowledge made explicit through naming)
- Norman, Donald. *The Design of Everyday Things* (mental models for complex systems)

**Concepts Applied:**
- **Metacognition**: Explicitly naming moves makes implicit processes visible and manageable
- **Mental models**: Shared vocabulary creates shared understanding of how the system works
- **Transfer**: Named processes are more readily transferable to new contexts than unnamed habits
- **Agency**: Naming gives students control over choices rather than following invisible scripts

---

## Rationale

### Why This Framing?

Traditional composition pedagogy often teaches "the writing process" (prewriting, drafting, revising, editing) as a linear sequence, which doesn't match how writers actually work. The six-moves vocabulary instead provides names for **discrete operations** that writers perform in various sequences, recursively, and sometimes simultaneously.

The framework originates from VIRENS design principles (see [[VIRENS-DESIGN-PRINCIPLES#B11]]) but translates to analog/low-tech practice accessible to first-year students. Students don't need to use VIRENS software—they need to understand the conceptual operations those tools automate.

**Why six moves rather than traditional process stages?**

Traditional stages (prewriting → drafting → revising → editing) imply:
- Linear progression
- Discrete boundaries between stages
- Completion of one stage before beginning another
- Product-oriented endpoints

The six moves instead emphasize:
- **Modular operations** that can be performed in any order
- **Recursive application** (you might classify, then capture more, then classify again)
- **System-level thinking** (how do pieces flow through your workspace?)
- **Both process and product** (publish is one move among six, not the singular endpoint)

### Theoretical Background

**From Composition Theory:**

Flower and Hayes's cognitive process model demonstrated that expert writers don't follow linear stages but rather recursively apply various sub-processes (planning, translating, reviewing) throughout composition. Our six moves operationalize this insight: instead of teaching "stages," we teach discrete operations that writers orchestrate according to rhetorical situation.

**From Systems Thinking:**

The six moves vocabulary maps onto information architecture principles:
- **Capture** = input/acquisition
- **Classify** = categorization/taxonomy
- **Route** = routing logic/conditionals  
- **Distill** = compression/extraction
- **Connect** = linking/association
- **Publish** = output/rendering

This parallel allows students to see writing not just as expression but as **information management**—a frame that becomes increasingly important as they accumulate 40-50 fragments.

**From Design Theory:**

Donald Norman's concept of "knowledge in the world vs. knowledge in the head" applies here. Without named moves, students rely entirely on tacit knowledge ("I just write"). Named moves externalize that knowledge, making it discussable, refinable, and teachable.

## Audience Considerations

### Student Perspective

Students encounter this vocabulary gradually across the semester:

| Movement | Emphasized Moves | How Introduced |
|----------|------------------|----------------|
| M1: Surfacing | Capture | Through freewriting practice, index card exercises |
| M2: Naming | Classify, Route | Through folder structure decisions, BEAM tagging |
| M3: Operating at Scale | Distill, Connect | Through revision work, cross-referencing |
| M4: Synthesis | Publish | Through portfolio assembly |

Students learn to **use the vocabulary to describe their own work**: "I captured three new fragments this morning" or "I need to classify these before I can route them properly." The vocabulary becomes part of class discourse.

### Institutional Context

The six-moves vocabulary aligns with WPA Outcomes Statement emphasis on:
- **Processes**: "Multiple strategies to approach and undertake writing"
- **Knowledge of Conventions**: "Formal and informal guidelines" (here, workflow conventions)
- **Critical Thinking**: "Composing processes" as object of analysis

It also positions the course as teaching **transferable skills** beyond traditional academic writing—skills applicable to any knowledge work involving information management.

## Alternative Approaches Considered

### Other Options

1. **Approach**: Use only traditional process terminology (prewriting, drafting, revising, editing)
   **Rejected because**: Reinforces linear thinking; doesn't provide vocabulary for corpus management; students already learned (and often misapplied) this vocabulary in high school

2. **Approach**: Don't teach explicit process vocabulary at all; let students discover their own language
   **Rejected because**: Inefficient; leads to idiosyncratic, non-transferable language; undermines peer feedback when students lack shared terminology

3. **Approach**: Teach the full VIRENS vocabulary (all six moves plus additional system concepts)
   **Rejected because**: Too much cognitive load; students don't need the full complexity of the VIRENS system to benefit from the core concepts

4. **Approach**: Use productivity/GTD (Getting Things Done) terminology
   **Rejected because**: Associations with corporate productivity culture; doesn't connect to composition pedagogy scholarship

## Connection to VIRENS Principles

The six-moves vocabulary directly implements several VIRENS design principles:

| VIRENS Principle | Application in Six-Moves Vocabulary |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------|
| **B11: Capture-First Design** | "Capture" as named first move emphasizes getting ideas down before worrying about structure |
| **B12: Multiple Discovery Paths** | Each move represents a different way to interact with accumulated material |
| **C19: Accumulation Creates Value** | Vocabulary frames writing as material that accumulates and compounds, not just discrete essays |
| **A04: Make Tacit Explicit** | Naming moves externalizes tacit writing knowledge |

The vocabulary serves as a **conceptual bridge** between low-tech student practice (index cards, Word documents) and high-tech VIRENS automation (Hazel rules, Shortcuts, Keyboard Maestro). Students won't use those tools, but they'll understand the **logic** those tools automate.

## Pedagogical Applications

### In Class Discussion

When students share their work or discuss difficulties, the six-moves vocabulary provides precise diagnostic language:

**Instead of:** "I don't know, I'm just stuck"  
**With vocabulary:** "I captured a bunch of ideas but I haven't classified them yet, so I don't know where they belong"

**Instead of:** "I can't find anything"  
**With vocabulary:** "I need better routing rules—everything's just piling up in one folder"

This precision helps both students and instructor identify **which operation is causing difficulty**, enabling targeted intervention.

### In Dev Logs

Students use six-moves vocabulary in their dev logs (process documentation):

> "This week I focused on **distilling** my fragments from M1. I realized I'd been **capturing** without **classifying**, so I had 15 fragments with no clear connection. I went back and **classified** them using BEAM tags, then **routed** them into thematic folders."

This use transforms abstract vocabulary into concrete practice documentation.

### In Peer Feedback

Reviewers can give actionable feedback using shared vocabulary:

> "You've **captured** a lot of interesting observations here, but I think you need to **distill** this down to identify the core argument. Right now it feels like you're still in expansion mode."

## Evidence & Iteration

### Evidence to Collect

- [ ] Student dev logs: frequency and accuracy of six-moves vocabulary usage
- [ ] Peer review comments: whether students use vocabulary to give specific feedback
- [ ] End-of-semester reflections: whether students identify six-moves framework as useful for transfer
- [ ] Mid-semester check-in: do students find the vocabulary clarifying or confusing?

### Revision Notes

**Potential adjustments based on implementation:**

- If students conflate "classify" and "route," consider combining or further distinguishing
- If "distill" proves too abstract, provide more concrete examples earlier
- If students overuse "capture" as catch-all, emphasize other moves more explicitly
- Consider creating visual diagram showing how moves relate to each other
