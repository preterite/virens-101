## Design Philosophy

### Core Pedagogical Principle

**Failure-as-diagnostic** treats difficulty, confusion, and stuck-ness not as problems to be eliminated but as **informational signals** about task complexity and student development. When writing feels hard, that difficulty carries meaning: it may indicate a threshold concept, an inappropriate level of abstraction, a constraint mismatch, or productive struggle at the edge of competence.

Traditional pedagogy often aims to **minimize difficulty** through scaffolding, models, and clear instructions. VIRENS 101 instead aims to **recontextualize difficulty** as diagnostic information. Students learn to ask:
- *What* is difficult? (Sentence-level? Organizational? Conceptual?)
- *Why* is it difficult? (Unfamiliar genre? Conflicting sources? Threshold concept?)
- *What does this difficulty reveal* about the task or my process?

This approach draws from **difficulty pedagogy** (Salvatori [[@salvatori1996conve]]), **threshold concepts** (Meyer & Land), and **design thinking** (Schön, Alexander [[@alexander1964notet]]), repositioning struggle as **evidence of learning** rather than evidence of failure.

### Theoretical Grounding

**Key Sources:**
- Salvatori, Mariolina. "Conversations with Texts: Reading in the Teaching of Composition" (difficulty as opportunity)
- Meyer, Jan H.F., and Ray Land. "Threshold Concepts and Troublesome Knowledge" (productive difficulty)
- Perl [[@perl1979compp]], Sondra. "Understanding Composing" (felt sense, recursive process)
- Alexander, Christopher. *Notes on the Synthesis of Form* (misfits as diagnostic)
- Schön, Donald. *The Reflective Practitioner* (reflection-in-action)

**Concepts Applied:**
- **Difficulty pedagogy**: Confusion signals encountering complex ideas worth grappling with (Salvatori)
- **Threshold concepts**: Transformative ideas that are initially troublesome (Meyer & Land)
- **Misfits**: Problems become visible when subsystems interact (Alexander)
- **Felt sense**: Writers recognize problems before articulating solutions (Perl)
- **Reflection-in-action**: Practitioners diagnose problems while working (Schön)

## Three Types of Productive Difficulty

### Type 1: Threshold Concept Difficulty

**Characteristics**:
- Initially seems counterintuitive or paradoxical
- Resistance: "But I thought writing should..."
- Transformation: Once grasped, changes how student sees writing

**Example**: **"Writing is recursive, not linear"**

**Student experience**:
- Week 1: "I just need to outline first, then write, then edit"
- Week 3: "I outlined but now my ideas don't fit the outline. Am I doing this wrong?"
- Week 5: "I revised my outline three times. Is that normal?"
- **Week 7**: "Oh—the outline *should* change as I write. Planning ≠ predicting."

**Pedagogical response**:
- Don't "fix" the confusion by providing prescriptive method
- Dev log prompt: "Describe when your plan changed and why"
- Normalize recursiveness through models, not by eliminating it
- Difficulty = signal student is encountering threshold concept

**Theoretical justification**: 

Meyer & Land: threshold concepts are "troublesome" because they require learners to abandon prior frameworks. Difficulty signals the productive discomfort of transformation. Rushing to resolve confusion prevents deep learning.

---

### Type 2: Level-of-Abstraction Difficulty

**Characteristics**:
- Student is working at wrong level for current task
- Effort doesn't produce progress
- Frustration: "I've been working for hours but nothing's better"

**Example**: **Sentence-level editing during invention**

**Student experience**:
- Student writes fragment, immediately edits grammar
- Fragment stalls at 150 words, student can't develop idea
- "I keep fixing sentences but the piece isn't going anywhere"

**Diagnostic question**: "What level are you working at? What level does the problem require?"

**Pedagogical response**:
- Identify level mismatch: "You're working at sentence level but the problem is idea-level"
- Constraint sequencing supports correct level: M1 delays sentence-level constraints
- Dev log captures realization: "Stopped editing sentences, generated 3 more paragraphs, *then* edited"

**Theoretical justification**:

Brooks's [[@brooks1986silve]] "essential vs. accidental complexity": Some problems can't be solved at the wrong abstraction level. Students waste effort on accidental complexity (sentence polishing) when essential complexity (idea development) remains unaddressed.

---

### Type 3: Constraint Mismatch Difficulty

**Characteristics**:
- Student applying inappropriate constraints to task
- Rigid adherence to "rules" that don't fit context
- Anxiety: "I'm following all the rules but it still feels wrong"

**Example**: **Forcing structure prematurely**

**Student experience**:
- Student writes 5 fragments on related topics
- Tries to organize into "intro, 3 body paragraphs, conclusion"
- Structure doesn't fit; fragments get truncated or padded
- "I can't make this work as a 5-paragraph essay"

**Diagnostic question**: "What if the problem isn't your writing but the structure you're trying to impose?"

**Pedagogical response**:
- Permission to violate familiar structures: "What if this needs a different shape?"
- Examples of non-traditional structures (Borges [[@borges1962labyr]], Ong [[@ong2012writi]], experimental forms)
- Spec document assignment: Student defines appropriate constraints for *this* project
- Dev log: "I tried X structure, it didn't fit, so I tried Y"

**Theoretical justification**:

Alexander's "misfits": Applying wrong constraints generates problems. Difficulty signals that constraints need revision. Pedagogically: students must learn to diagnose constraint mismatch, not just follow prescriptions.

## Making Difficulty Legible

### Dev Log as Diagnostic Tool

**Purpose**: Capture difficulty *while experiencing it*, creating record for later analysis.

**Structure**:
```
What I did: [Actions taken]
What happened: [Results, problems encountered]
What I learned: [Interpretation, next steps]
```

**Example capturing threshold difficulty**:
> What I did: Tried to write final draft of fragment on social media addiction
> What happened: Kept changing my mind about main point while writing
> What I learned: Maybe I shouldn't finalize the claim until I see what evidence says? Feels backwards but might be how research works?

**Pedagogical value**: Student names the difficulty (changing main point), begins diagnosing cause (evidence-driven thinking vs. thesis-driven thinking), tentatively identifies threshold concept (research = inquiry, not proof).

---

### Constraint Experiments as Controlled Difficulty

**Purpose**: Deliberately introduce difficulty to reveal what constraints do.

**Structure**:
1. Write fragment following constraint
2. Write fragment *violating* constraint  
3. Compare: What changes? What's harder/easier?
4. Reflect: When is this constraint useful?

**Example**: **No "I" statements constraint**

- Fragment A (with constraint): Forced passive voice, awkward phrasing, felt inauthentic
- Fragment B (without constraint): More fluid, but harder to make claims sound authoritative
- **Learning**: "I" isn't always wrong—depends on genre, purpose, relationship to reader

**Pedagogical value**: Difficulty reveals what constraints enable/prevent. Students develop rhetorical understanding (when to follow/violate conventions) rather than mechanical compliance.

---

### Peer Review as Distributed Diagnosis

**Purpose**: Multiple readers identify different difficulties → more complete diagnostic picture.

**Eli Review approach**:
- Three readers per text
- Readers identify: Where did you get confused? Where did you want more? Where did pacing feel wrong?
- Writer receives pattern data: All three readers confused at paragraph 3 → signal of difficulty

**Pedagogical value**: 

Difficulty isn't just *writer's* problem; it's *text's* problem. Peer feedback externalizes difficulty, making it visible and addressable. Writer learns: difficulty = information about reader experience.

---

## Difficulty Pedagogy Across the Semester

### Movement 1 (Weeks 1-3): Normalize Difficulty

**Goal**: Establish that difficulty is expected, not failure.

**Activities**:
- Envelope exercise: Deliberately give confusing prompt → normalize confusion
- Freewriting: "Don't stop even when stuck" → work through difficulty
- Dev logs: "What was hard?" becomes standard reflection question

**Assessment**: Participation credit for *documenting* difficulty, not for avoiding it.

---

### Movement 2 (Weeks 4-7): Name Difficulty

**Goal**: Develop vocabulary for types of difficulty.

**Activities**:
- Salvatori reading on difficulty pedagogy
- BEAM tagging: "Which fragments were hardest to categorize? Why?"
- Spec documents: "What makes this project difficult? What constraints would help?"

**Assessment**: Dev logs show increasing precision in naming difficulty types.

---

### Movement 3 (Weeks 8-11): Diagnose Difficulty

**Goal**: Use difficulty as information for revision.

**Activities**:
- Process archaeology: "When did difficulty signal important learning?"
- Corpus management: "What's hard about organizing 30+ fragments? What does that reveal?"
- Documented inquiry: Pursue question *because* it's difficult

**Assessment**: Portfolio includes "productive difficulty" examples.

---

### Movement 4 (Weeks 12-15): Reflect on Difficulty

**Goal**: Articulate how difficulty drove learning.

**Activities**:
- Portfolio introduction: "What was hardest? What did that difficulty teach?"
- Process archaeology: Trace difficulty pattern across semester
- Transfer reflection: "What difficulties do I expect in future writing contexts?"

**Assessment**: Metacognitive sophistication in discussing difficulty.

## Comparison to Traditional Deficit Models

### Traditional "Fix-It" Model

| Assumption | Pedagogical Response |
|------------|---------------------|
| Difficulty = lack of skill | Provide more instruction |
| Confusion = poor scaffolding | Break task into smaller steps |
| Struggle = need for intervention | Rescue student immediately |
| **Goal**: Eliminate difficulty | **Result**: Students never learn to diagnose problems |

### Difficulty-as-Diagnostic Model

| Assumption | Pedagogical Response |
|------------|---------------------|
| Difficulty = informational signal | Help student interpret signal |
| Confusion = encountering complexity | Support productive struggle |
| Struggle = edge of development | Scaffold *interpretation*, not elimination of difficulty |
| **Goal**: Recontextualize difficulty | **Result**: Students develop diagnostic capacity |

## Implementation Challenges

### Challenge 1: "But Some Difficulty Is Just Bad Writing"

**Issue**: Not all difficulty is productive; some reflects actual skill gaps.

**Mitigation**:
- Distinguish *productive* difficulty (threshold concepts, level mismatches) from *unproductive* difficulty (lack of prior knowledge)
- Provide direct instruction where needed (citation mechanics, sentence clarity)
- Dev logs help students identify: "Is this hard because it's new territory or because I'm missing a skill?"

---

### Challenge 2: Student Anxiety

**Issue**: Students expect clarity, experience difficulty-pedagogy as withholding help.

**Mitigation**:
- Explicit framing: "Difficulty ≠ failure"
- Model instructor difficulty: "Here's where I got stuck, here's what I learned"
- Graduated support: More scaffolding early, less as semester progresses
- Assessment rewards difficulty-documentation, not difficulty-avoidance

---

### Challenge 3: Distinguishing Difficulty from Inaccessibility

**Issue**: Pedagogically productive difficulty must be distinguished from barriers created by inaccessible design.

**Mitigation**:
- UDL principles: Multiple means of representation, engagement, expression
- Difficulty should be *intellectual*, not *logistical* (confusing instructions, inaccessible materials)
- Regular check-ins: "Is this hard because it's challenging your thinking (productive) or because the task is unclear (design problem)?"

---

## Evidence to Collect

### Evidence This Is Working

- [ ] Students use difficulty vocabulary in dev logs ("threshold concept," "level mismatch")
- [ ] Metacognitive sophistication increases over semester
- [ ] Portfolio reflections demonstrate understanding of productive vs. unproductive difficulty
- [ ] Students report confidence in diagnosing writing problems independently

### Revision Notes

<!-- After pilot: What worked, what needs adjustment -->

[PLACEHOLDER: Post-pilot analysis]

- Monitor: Do students experience difficulty as productive or demoralizing?
- Assess: Which difficulties most commonly misinterpreted? (Need better framing?)
- Adjust: Should explicit "difficulty types" taxonomy be introduced earlier?
