## Design Philosophy

### Core Pedagogical Principle

The **corpse → compost → garden** metaphor provides students with a narrative arc for understanding textual accumulation and transformation. This three-stage framework normalizes the initially disorienting experience of generating "messy" fragments (corpse stage), reframes confusion as productive transformation (compost stage), and positions curation as cultivation (garden stage).

The metaphor serves three pedagogical functions:

1. **Normalizes discomfort**: "Dead" material isn't failure—it's raw material for transformation
2. **Reframes revision**: Not fixing corpses, but composting them into fertile growth medium
3. **Values process**: Final portfolio (garden) emerges from, but doesn't erase, earlier stages

This approach challenges **product-oriented** pedagogy (write draft, revise draft, submit) with **transformation-oriented** pedagogy (accumulate, transform, curate). It explicitly values the palimpsest—layers remain visible rather than being erased.

### Theoretical Grounding

**Key Sources:**
- Yancey [[@yancey1998refle]], Kathleen Blake. "Postmodernism, Palimpsest, and Portfolios" (layering, accumulation)
- Perl [[@perl1979compp]], Sondra. "Understanding Composing" (recursive process, felt sense)
- Sommers, Nancy. "Revision Strategies" (experienced writers see globally, not locally)
- Murray [[@murray1972teach]], Donald. "Internal Revision" (discovery through writing)
- Bernstein, Charles. "Artifice of Absorption" (writing as making, not transcribing thought)

**Concepts Applied:**
- **Palimpsest**: Earlier writing remains visible beneath later writing (Yancey)
- **Recursiveness**: Writing generates thinking which generates more writing (Perl, Murray)
- **Global revision**: Experienced writers reimagine purpose, not just fix sentences (Sommers)
- **Composing as discovery**: You don't know what you think until you write (Murray)
- **Materiality**: Writing is physical/temporal labor, not just mental activity (Bernstein)

## Stage 1: Corpse (Weeks 1-4, Movement 1)

### The Metaphor

**Dead material**: Fragments that feel disconnected, inert, sometimes contradictory. Not alive as "finished writing" but raw material awaiting transformation.

**Student anxiety**: "This is garbage," "Nothing connects," "What am I even doing?"

**Pedagogical reframe**: "Yes—it's supposed to be dead. We're not trying to write perfect prose yet. We're mining raw material."

### Why "Corpse"?

The metaphor is deliberately provocative to:
1. **Acknowledge discomfort**: Students feel anxiety about messy fragments—metaphor validates that feeling
2. **Prevent premature polish**: If material is "dead," you won't waste time prettying it up
3. **Promise transformation**: Corpses become compost; death isn't the end state

**Alternative metaphors considered** (and why rejected):
- "Rough drafts" → implies next step is "smooth draft" (iterative polish, not transformation)
- "Raw material" → too generic, doesn't capture discomfort
- "Seeds" → implies current form contains future (wrong—fragments *transform*)

### Pedagogical Activities in Corpse Stage

**Goal**: Maximize generation, minimize evaluation.

**Activities**:
- Freewriting: Daily 10-15 minutes, low stakes
- Fragment accumulation: 3-4 per week, minimal constraints
- Index cards: Physical/analog capture for tactile materiality
- Envelope exercise: Deliberately confusing prompt to normalize not-knowing

**Assessment**:
- Participation credit for *quantity* (fragments generated)
- No quality assessment yet
- Dev logs document process, not product

**What This Looks Like**:

**Fragment from Week 2**:
> "Social media makes me anxious but I keep checking it. Dopamine? Everyone says addiction but is that actually true or just a metaphor? I read something about variable reinforcement schedules like in gambling. Phones are slot machines for attention? But also I genuinely care about my friends' posts. Is that addiction or connection? Unclear."

**Pedagogical value**: Fragment is "dead" (doesn't argue coherently, contradicts itself, raises more questions than answers), but it's **generative**. The confusion is productive—student is thinking through complexity, not resolving it prematurely.

### Theoretical Justification

**Murray's "Internal Revision"**: 
Discovery happens *through* writing, not before it. Students can't know what they're arguing until they generate material. Corpse stage creates permission to write-to-discover rather than write-to-demonstrate.

**Perl's "Felt Sense"**:
Writers often recognize productive territory ("there's something here") before articulating clear claims. Corpse stage honors felt sense—students follow promising confusion rather than forcing clarity.

---

## Stage 2: Compost (Weeks 5-9, Movement 2)

### The Metaphor

**Decomposition and transformation**: "Dead" fragments begin breaking down through connection, juxtaposition, and peer feedback. Contradictions become productive tensions. Confusion reveals complexity. Raw material transforms into fertile medium.

**Student experience**: "Wait, these three fragments are actually about the same underlying issue," "This fragment from Week 2 means something different now that I've read Meadows [[@meadows2008lever]]."

**Pedagogical reframe**: "Decomposition is the work. You're not fixing dead fragments—you're transforming them through connection."

### Why "Compost"?

The metaphor emphasizes:
1. **Transformation requires time**: Can't rush composting; fragments need weeks to reveal connections
2. **Breaking down is building up**: Decomposition (challenging initial framing) creates fertility (new insights)
3. **Mixed inputs create richness**: Disparate fragments composting together generate unexpected combinations
4. **Process is messy**: Compost pile isn't aesthetic; neither is this stage

### Pedagogical Activities in Compost Stage

**Goal**: Facilitate connection-making, categorization, transformation through feedback.

**Activities**:
- BEAM tagging: Categorizing how sources function (breaking fragments into components)
- Peer review: External perspectives decompose assumptions (Eli Review cycles)
- SEAR protocol: Connecting fragments to sources (Situate, Embed, Analyze, Relate)
- Spec documents: Defining constraints for particular projects (student agency increases)
- Cross-fragment analysis: Identifying patterns across corpus

**Assessment**:
- Quality of *connections* (BEAM accuracy, peer review depth)
- Sophistication of *categorization* (spec documents)
- Evidence of *transformation* (dev logs showing changed thinking)

**What This Looks Like**:

**Week 2 fragment** (from corpse stage):
> "Social media makes me anxious but I keep checking it..."

**Week 6 transformation** (after reading Meadows on feedback loops):
> "Meadows describes reinforcing feedback loops where output amplifies input. Social media anxiety is a reinforcing loop: I check phone → feel anxious about notifications → check again to resolve anxiety → see more notifications → anxiety increases. But Meadows also says reinforcing loops can be positive (learning) or negative (addiction). My phone use might be both simultaneously—reinforcing connection *and* reinforcing anxiety. The question isn't 'is this addiction?' but 'what loop am I reinforcing?'"

**Pedagogical value**: Fragment has **decomposed** (simpler question broken into components) and **transformed** (systems thinking vocabulary applied). Not "better writing" (still exploratory), but **more sophisticated thinking**.

### Theoretical Justification

**Yancey's "Palimpsest"**:
Revision isn't erasure—it's layering. Week 6 fragment doesn't replace Week 2 fragment; it builds on it. Both remain in corpus. Portfolio might include both, showing thinking development.

**Sommers's "Revision Strategies"**:
Experienced writers revise globally (reconceiving purpose, audience, structure), not just locally (fixing sentences). Compost stage introduces global revision—seeing fragments from new angles, re-categorizing, reconceiving relationships.

---

## Stage 3: Garden (Weeks 10-15, Movements 3-4)

### The Metaphor

**Cultivation and harvest**: Composted material has generated fertile ground. Students now **cultivate** (select what to grow) and **harvest** (curate portfolio). Not all fragments make final portfolio—some remain as compost, enriching the thinking that produced selected pieces.

**Student experience**: "These 12 fragments form a coherent inquiry," "I see a pattern across my semester's work," "This piece doesn't fit the portfolio story, but I needed to write it to get here."

**Pedagogical reframe**: "Portfolio is a garden you're cultivating, not a warehouse of everything you grew. Strategic curation is sophisticated intellectual work."

### Why "Garden"?

The metaphor emphasizes:
1. **Living system**: Portfolio isn't static collection; it's curated to present coherent thinking
2. **Selection is strategy**: What to include/exclude requires judgment (gardeners prune)
3. **Growth requires foundation**: Can't have garden without compost stage
4. **Tending continues**: Portfolio introduction and process archaeology are ongoing curation

### Pedagogical Activities in Garden Stage

**Goal**: Strategic curation, synthesis, metacognitive reflection.

**Activities**:
- **Corpus review** (Week 10): Read entire accumulated corpus, note patterns
- **Selection criteria**: Define what "coherence" means for *this* portfolio
- **Documented inquiry**: Pursue question across 5+ fragments, showing synthesis
- **Process archaeology**: Trace development of key ideas across semester
- **Portfolio introduction**: Frame collection, explain selection logic
- **Final polish**: Sentence-level revision on selected pieces only

**Assessment**:
- **Coherence**: Does portfolio tell unified story?
- **Curation**: Does selection demonstrate judgment?
- **Polish**: Is selected work refined?
- **Reflection**: Does student articulate transformation process?

**What This Looks Like**:

**Portfolio structure** (Week 15):
- **Introduction**: "My inquiry into feedback systems in digital culture"
- **Selected fragments**: 12 fragments showing development from personal experience → systems thinking → documented research
- **Process archaeology**: "How I moved from 'social media is bad' to 'reinforcing loops shape behavior'"
- **Works cited**: 18 sources, BEAM-categorized

**Excluded fragments**: 30+ fragments remain in archive—some became parts of other fragments, some were dead ends, some enriched thinking without making final cut.

**Pedagogical value**: Portfolio demonstrates **growth** (corpse → compost → garden visible in process archaeology), **judgment** (selection), **synthesis** (coherent inquiry), and **polish** (selected pieces refined).

### Theoretical Justification

**Yancey's "Portfolios as Representation"**:
Portfolio isn't comprehensive—it's *strategic representation*. Students learn that **what you leave out** is as important as **what you include**. This is professional curation skill.

**Sommers's "Experienced Writers"**:
Experienced writers revise by stepping back, seeing whole, reimagining purpose. Garden stage requires corpus-level vision—students must see their 40+ fragments as a collection from which to build coherent inquiry.

## The Metaphor Sequence: Pedagogical Coherence

### Why This Arc Matters

The corpse → compost → garden metaphor provides:

1. **Narrative coherence**: Semester has beginning/middle/end structure students can grasp
2. **Emotional validation**: Each stage's discomfort is anticipated, named, normalized
3. **Process visibility**: Transformation isn't magic—it's explicit work
4. **Transfer potential**: Metaphor generalizes to other creative/intellectual projects

### How Students Experience the Arc

| Week | Stage | Dominant Feeling | Pedagogical Response |
|------|-------|------------------|---------------------|
| 1-4 | Corpse | Anxiety ("This is messy") | "Yes—it's supposed to be" |
| 5-9 | Compost | Confusion ("Things are breaking down") | "Yes—that's transformation" |
| 10-15 | Garden | Recognition ("Oh, I see a pattern") | "Yes—that's emergence" |

### Critical Moments in Arc

**Moment 1: Accepting corpse stage** (Week 2-3)
- Students resist generating "bad" writing
- Envelope exercise deliberately creates confusion
- Dev logs normalize: "I don't know what I'm doing, and that's okay"

**Moment 2: Recognizing compost** (Week 6-7)
- Students experience "productive difficulty" (fragments not cooperating)
- BEAM tagging reveals complexity (fragments harder to categorize than expected)
- Peer feedback challenges assumptions (decomposition)

**Moment 3: Seeing garden emerge** (Week 11-12)
- Corpus review activity: Students surprised by patterns across fragments
- "I didn't know I was arguing this until I saw it all together"
- Portfolio selection becomes **discovery**, not just **presentation**

---

## Alternative Metaphors Considered

### Rejected: Building Blocks

**Metaphor**: Fragments are building blocks → assemble into structure

**Why rejected**: 
- Implies fragments remain unchanged (no transformation)
- Suggests predetermined structure (against emergence)
- Doesn't normalize messiness (blocks should be clean, regular)

### Rejected: Mining and Refining

**Metaphor**: Fragments are ore → refine into pure metal

**Why rejected**:
- Implies discarding "impurities" (but "dead" fragments are valuable)
- Suggests single end product (not curated collection)
- Industrial metaphor doesn't capture organic growth

### Why Corpse → Compost → Garden Works

**Organic process**: Emphasizes transformation, emergence, time
**Validates discomfort**: Each stage has legitimate difficulty
**Cycles**: Gardens generate seeds for next year (transfer)
**Materiality**: Physical/temporal labor visible

## Implementation Challenges

### Challenge 1: "Corpse" Too Morbid?

**Issue**: Some students/colleagues may find metaphor off-putting.

**Mitigation**:
- Explain metaphor explicitly (not gratuitous—pedagogically motivated)
- Alternative framing available: "raw material → fertile medium → cultivated collection"
- Student choice: Use metaphor if helpful, use different language if not

### Challenge 2: Holding Uncertainty

**Issue**: Students want clarity ("just tell me what good writing looks like").

**Mitigation**:
- Metaphor provides *process* clarity even when *product* remains uncertain
- Dev logs scaffold tolerance for ambiguity
- Compost stage has concrete activities (BEAM, peer review) even when outcomes uncertain

### Challenge 3: Recognizing Emergence

**Issue**: Students may not notice patterns until explicitly prompted.

**Mitigation**:
- Week 10 corpus review activity: Structured prompts to identify patterns
- Peer review: "What patterns do you see across this writer's fragments?"
- Process archaeology assignment: Trace one idea across multiple fragments

---

## Evidence to Collect

### Evidence This Is Working

- [ ] Students use metaphor vocabulary in dev logs ("composting these ideas")
- [ ] Process archaeology demonstrates understanding of transformation
- [ ] Portfolio introductions articulate corpse → garden journey
- [ ] Students transfer metaphor to other contexts ("My research is in compost stage")

### Revision Notes

<!-- After pilot: What worked, what needs adjustment -->

[PLACEHOLDER: Post-pilot analysis]

- Monitor: Do students embrace or resist "corpse" language?
- Assess: At what point do students recognize compost→garden transition?
- Adjust: Should metaphor be introduced Week 1 or emerge Week 5?
