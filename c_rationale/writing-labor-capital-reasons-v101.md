## Design Philosophy

### Core Pedagogical Principle

VIRENS 101 distinguishes between **writing-as-verb** (the labor of composing) and **writing-as-noun** (the capital accumulated through that labor). Traditional composition pedagogy often treats writing exclusively as labor: students write, receive feedback, revise, submit, and start over with a new assignment. The accumulated text—the corpus—is discarded rather than treated as **capital** that generates future value.

This framework has two pedagogical goals:

1. **Make labor visible**: Process documentation (dev logs, process archaeology) reveals the typically invisible work of writing
2. **Treat products as capital**: Fragments accumulate into a corpus that students actively manage, curate, and deploy strategically

By the end of the semester, students have both:
- **Labor record**: 30+ dev log entries documenting work processes
- **Capital stock**: 40-50 fragments + polished portfolio pieces

This dual emphasis challenges the **episodic model** of traditional composition (discrete assignments, each complete in itself) with an **accumulation model** (continuous building of textual capital over time).

### Theoretical Grounding

**Key Sources:**
- Yancey, Kathleen Blake. "Postmodernism, Palimpsest, and Portfolios" (accumulation, revision-as-archaeology)
- Perl, Sondra. "Understanding Composing" (writing as process, not product)
- North, Stephen. *The Making of Knowledge in Composition* (practitioner knowledge)
- Schön, Donald. *The Reflective Practitioner* (professional knowledge-in-action)
- Brooks, Frederick. *Mythical Man-Month* ("No silver bullet" - essential vs. accidental complexity)

**Concepts Applied:**
- **Palimpsest**: Writing as layering; earlier texts remain present beneath revisions (Yancey)
- **Process-as-knowledge**: The labor of writing generates metacognitive understanding (Perl, Schön)
- **Capital accumulation**: Building stock of reusable/remixable textual resources
- **Essential complexity**: Some writing tasks are inherently difficult; recognizing this is pedagogically valuable (Brooks)

## Writing-as-Verb: Making Labor Visible

### The Invisibility Problem

**Traditional model**:
- Student submits 5-page essay
- Instructor sees product, not process
- Grade reflects text quality, not labor invested
- Struggling students' efforts remain invisible

**Consequences**:
- Students who work hard but produce weaker texts feel devalued
- Students who produce strong texts quickly may not develop robust processes
- Instructor can't intervene during process—only after completion
- Writing appears to be "natural talent" rather than learned skill

### Process Documentation as Labor Record

**VIRENS 101 approach**:
- **Dev logs** (2×/week): "What I did / What happened / What I learned"
- **System maps**: Visualizing workflow, tool use, constraint navigation
- **Process archaeology**: Reconstructing decisions from earlier in semester
- **Eli Review participation**: Documented peer engagement

**Pedagogical rationale**:

Process documentation serves multiple functions:

1. **Makes labor visible for assessment**: Participation grade (100 pts) values documented effort
2. **Generates metacognitive awareness**: Reflecting on process develops self-knowledge
3. **Creates evidence for intervention**: Instructor can identify stuck students before deadline
4. **Builds professional habit**: Process docs are standard in software dev, design, research

**What This Looks Like**:

**Dev log excerpt (Week 3)**:
> "What I did: Tried to organize my 8 fragments by topic but they overlap—some are about social media AND mental health AND gender. Got frustrated and stopped.
> What happened: Realized I need categories that allow overlap, not strict buckets.
> What I learned: Organization isn't about putting things in boxes; it's about naming relationships."

**Pedagogical value**: This labor (attempting organization, recognizing problem, generating insight) is invisible in final product but essential to learning.

### Assessment Alignment

| Assignment | Labor Component | Capital Component | Weight |
|------------|-----------------|-------------------|--------|
| Dev logs | Process documentation | (Process insights become capital for reflection) | 100 pts |
| Peer reviews | Feedback labor | (Feedback techniques become transferable capital) | 200 pts |
| Generative writing | Daily composing labor | Fragment corpus | 100 pts |
| Portfolio | Curation labor | Polished selected texts | 450 pts |

**Rationale**: Labor and capital both carry grade weight. Students can't succeed by producing strong texts without documented process, nor by documenting extensive process without producing texts.

## Writing-as-Noun: Accumulating Capital

### The Episodic Model Problem

**Traditional model**:
- Assignment 1: Personal narrative (complete, submit, done)
- Assignment 2: Rhetorical analysis (start fresh)
- Assignment 3: Research paper (start fresh)
- **No accumulation across assignments**

**Consequences**:
- Students never develop corpus management skills
- Each assignment begins at zero (no reuse)
- Revision = fixing current draft, not reimagining corpus
- Students experience writing as series of isolated tasks

### Fragment-Based Capital Accumulation

**VIRENS 101 approach**:
- **Target**: 40-50 fragments by Week 12
- **Fragment definition**: 150-400 words, one claim + evidence
- **Organization**: By Movement, with cross-references
- **Deployment**: Fragments are raw material for all formal assignments

**Pedagogical rationale**:

Fragments are **capital** because they:
1. **Appreciate over time**: Week 3 fragment gains value when connected to Week 7 reading
2. **Generate returns**: Single fragment may appear in multiple portfolio pieces
3. **Enable scale**: Can't select "best 10" unless you have 40 to choose from
4. **Require management**: Students learn corpus-level thinking (not just document-level)

**What This Looks Like**:

**Week 3**: Student writes fragment about personal smartphone use
**Week 6**: Connects that fragment to reading about attention economy (BEAM: Exhibit)
**Week 9**: Incorporates smartphone fragment into documented inquiry about digital labor
**Week 14**: Polishes smartphone fragment for portfolio inclusion, writes introduction linking it to three related fragments

**Pedagogical value**: Fragment has appreciated in value through connections. Initial 300-word freewrite becomes foundation for portfolio-quality work.

### Capital Management Skills

Students develop corpus-level competencies:

1. **Inventory**: What do I have? (File naming, folder structure)
2. **Appraisal**: Which fragments are most valuable? (Selection criteria)
3. **Connection**: How do fragments relate? (Cross-referencing, BEAM tagging)
4. **Deployment**: Where should fragments appear? (Strategic inclusion)
5. **Depreciation recognition**: Some fragments won't make portfolio (curation judgment)

**Theoretical justification**: These are **information management** skills transferable beyond composition. Managing corpus of 40+ fragments prepares students for managing larger textual collections in professional/academic contexts.

## Episodic vs. Accumulation Models Compared

### Traditional Episodic Model

| Feature | Structure |
|---------|-----------|
| Assignment pattern | 3-4 discrete papers |
| Starting point | Zero (each time) |
| Revision | Fix current draft |
| Assessment | Each paper graded separately |
| End state | 3-4 finished texts |
| Transfer value | Unclear (what carries forward?) |

**Metaphor**: **Renting** — students occupy text temporarily, then vacate for next assignment

### VIRENS Accumulation Model

| Feature | Structure |
|---------|-----------|
| Assignment pattern | Continuous fragment generation + periodic curation |
| Starting point | Grows (each fragment builds corpus) |
| Revision | Corpus-level reorganization + local polishing |
| Assessment | Process + product, labor + capital |
| End state | 40-50 fragments + curated portfolio |
| Transfer value | Explicit (corpus management, process documentation) |

**Metaphor**: **Building equity** — students accumulate assets that appreciate over time

## The Corpse → Compost → Garden Arc

The accumulation model follows a **three-stage narrative**:

### Stage 1: Corpse (Weeks 1-4)

**Metaphor**: Fragment pile is "dead" material—disconnected, inert, sometimes contradictory

**Student experience**:
- Anxiety: "This is a mess"
- Confusion: "What do I do with all this?"
- Doubt: "Is this even writing?"

**Pedagogical response**:
- Normalize messiness: "This is productive"
- Delay organization: "Not yet"
- Value quantity: "Keep generating"

### Stage 2: Compost (Weeks 5-9)

**Metaphor**: "Dead" fragments begin decomposing (connecting, transforming) into fertile material

**Student experience**:
- Recognition: "Oh, these three fragments are about same issue"
- Transformation: "This fragment from Week 2 means something different now"
- Emergence: "A pattern I didn't plan is appearing"

**Pedagogical response**:
- Name connections: "BEAM tags identify relationships"
- Facilitate decomposition: "Peer review breaks down assumptions"
- Encourage transformation: "Revise doesn't mean 'fix'—it means 'see differently'"

### Stage 3: Garden (Weeks 10-15)

**Metaphor**: Compost yields growth—coherent inquiry emerges from accumulated, transformed fragments

**Student experience**:
- Selection: "These 12 fragments form an inquiry"
- Cultivation: "I'll polish these, let others remain drafts"
- Harvest: "Portfolio represents my thinking across semester"

**Pedagogical response**:
- Support curation: "What story does this collection tell?"
- Value process archaeology: "How did you get here?"
- Celebrate emergence: "You couldn't have planned this in Week 1"

**Theoretical justification**: 

Yancey's "palimpsest" concept: revision isn't erasure but layering. The corpse→compost→garden metaphor makes this visible. Early fragments remain present (in archive) even if not in final portfolio. Their value was in generating the thinking that led to later work.

## Implementation Challenges

### Challenge 1: "But I Don't Have Anything Good Yet"

**Issue**: Students want to start portfolio with "good writing," feel anxious about accumulating "bad" fragments.

**Mitigation**:
- Reframe quality: Good = useful for thinking, not just polished prose
- Model instructor fragments showing messy early work
- Assessment: Participation points for generating, not for quality in M1
- Corpse metaphor normalizes "dead" material as necessary stage

### Challenge 2: Corpus Overwhelm

**Issue**: By Week 8, students have 25-30 fragments and feel paralyzed.

**Mitigation**:
- Naming/tagging reduces cognitive load (BEAM categories)
- Folder structure (by Movement) provides initial organization
- Class time for corpus review: "Open your M1 folder, skim everything, note surprises"
- Documented inquiry assignment: Select small subset (3-5 fragments), work deeply rather than comprehensively

### Challenge 3: Capital Depreciation Anxiety

**Issue**: Students distressed by excluding fragments from portfolio.

**Mitigation**:
- Explicit framing: "Not included ≠ wasted; those fragments generated the thinking"
- Process archaeology values entire corpus, not just portfolio selections
- Portfolio can reference excluded fragments: "I also explored X but chose to focus on Y"
- Retention: Archive remains available after semester

## Evidence to Collect

### Evidence This Is Working

- [ ] Fragment counts meet targets (40-50 by Week 12)
- [ ] Dev logs show corpus-level thinking ("I noticed across my fragments...")
- [ ] Portfolio reflections articulate accumulation process
- [ ] Students report confidence in managing larger writing projects

### Revision Notes

<!-- After pilot: What worked, what needs adjustment -->

[PLACEHOLDER: Post-pilot analysis]

- Monitor: Is 40-50 fragments too many? Too few?
- Assess: Do students experience accumulation as productive or overwhelming?
- Adjust: Should some fragments be retired/archived mid-semester?
