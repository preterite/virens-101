## Design Philosophy

### Core Pedagogical Principle

Traditional citation pedagogy treats citations primarily as **formatting requirements** (MLA vs. APA) and **plagiarism prevention**. VIRENS 101 reframes citations as **dependency management**—making explicit how one's thinking depends on, builds from, challenges, or dialogues with others' ideas.

This reframing draws from five interlocking metaphors:

1. **Citation as link/pointer**: Directs reader to source material (hypertext model)
2. **Citation as vector**: Indicates direction and magnitude of influence
3. **Citation as protocol**: Establishes terms for intellectual exchange
4. **Citation as signal**: Reveals disciplinary positioning and rhetorical stance
5. **Citation as affect**: Embodies relationships (respect, critique, solidarity, distance)

By foregrounding citations as **intellectual relationships** rather than mechanical requirements, we shift student focus from "avoiding plagiarism" to "participating in conversation."

### Theoretical Grounding

**Key Sources:**
- Bazerman, Charles. "Intertextual Self-Fashioning" (citation as identity construction)
- Howard, Rebecca Moore. "Plagiarisms, Authorships, and the Academic Death Penalty" (patchwriting, authorship)
- Porter, James. "Intertextuality and the Discourse Community" (all writing is intertextual)
- Swales, John. *Genre Analysis* (citation practices in academic discourse)
- Brooks, Frederick. *Mythical Man-Month* (dependency management in software)

**Concepts Applied:**
- **Intertextuality**: All texts exist in web of prior texts (Porter, Kristeva)
- **Dependency management**: Complex projects require tracking what depends on what (Brooks)
- **Rhetorical positioning**: Citations signal how writer positions self in field (Swales)
- **Patchwriting**: Intermediate stage between copying and independent authorship (Howard)

## Five Metaphors for Citation

### Metaphor 1: Citation as Link/Pointer

**Core concept**: Like hyperlinks, citations point from your text to source material.

**Why this matters**:
- **Directionality**: Citation creates one-way connection (you → source)
- **Navigation**: Readers can follow link to verify, read more, trace influence
- **Dead links**: Incorrect citations = broken links (reader can't reach source)
- **Link rot**: Sources become inaccessible over time (preservation problem)

**Pedagogical application**:
- Students practice creating **bidirectional networks**: their fragments link to sources; sources link to other sources
- "Related work" sections become **link neighborhoods**: showing local connections
- BEAM tagging identifies **link type**: Background link ≠ Exhibit link ≠ Argument link

**Student activity**: 
**Graph visualization**: Draw network diagram showing how your 5 fragments connect to 3 sources and sources connect to each other.

**Theoretical justification**:
Landow's hypertext theory: All text is networked; print citations are hyperlinks constrained by medium. Digital natives understand links intuitively—citation-as-link builds on existing literacy.

---

### Metaphor 2: Citation as Vector

**Core concept**: Like mathematical vectors, citations have **direction** (from you to source) and **magnitude** (strength of influence).

**Why this matters**:
- **Direction**: Are you building from source? Challenging it? Extending it?
- **Magnitude**: Is this a foundational influence or minor supporting detail?
- **Composition**: Multiple influences combine like force vectors

**Pedagogical application**:
- BEAM categories indicate **vector type**:
  - **Background**: Low magnitude, contextual direction
  - **Exhibit**: Medium magnitude, evidential direction
  - **Argument**: High magnitude, dialogic direction
  - **Method**: Variable magnitude, procedural direction

**Student activity**:
**Vector annotation**: Mark citations with arrows showing direction of influence and weight (thin/thick line for magnitude).

**Example**:
> Salvatori's difficulty pedagogy **→** [Heavy influence: foundational to my argument]
> versus
> Oxford English Dictionary **→** [Light influence: definitional reference]

**Theoretical justification**:
Bazerman's "intertextual self-fashioning": Citations aren't neutral; they construct author identity by showing intellectual lineage and chosen influences.

---

### Metaphor 3: Citation as Protocol

**Core concept**: Like communication protocols (HTTP, TCP/IP), citation systems establish **rules for information exchange**.

**Why this matters**:
- **Interoperability**: Following protocol enables communication across contexts
- **Version control**: Different protocols (MLA, APA, Chicago) serve different communities
- **Error handling**: Incorrect protocol → communication failure

**Pedagogical application**:
- Zotero handles **protocol implementation** (formatting) so students focus on **protocol meaning** (why cite?)
- Citation styles aren't arbitrary—they encode disciplinary values:
  - **MLA** (author-page): Values text, humanistic interpretation
  - **APA** (author-date): Values recency, scientific progress
  - **Chicago** (footnotes): Values archival completeness, historical research

**Student activity**:
**Protocol analysis**: Compare how same source appears in MLA vs. APA. What values do formatting differences reveal?

**Theoretical justification**:
Swales's genre analysis: Citation practices are genre-specific; mastering genre requires understanding citation conventions as meaningful choices, not arbitrary rules.

---

### Metaphor 4: Citation as Signal

**Core concept**: Citations **signal** to readers where you stand in relation to disciplinary conversations.

**Why this matters**:
- **Currency**: Recent citations signal engagement with cutting-edge work
- **Canonical works**: Classic citations signal disciplinary literacy
- **Omissions**: What you *don't* cite reveals gaps or boundaries
- **Clustering**: Citing multiple works from same school/approach signals alignment

**Pedagogical application**:
- "Works Cited" isn't bureaucratic requirement—it's **rhetorical statement** about your intellectual community
- Students analyze **who they cite**: Whose voices are present/absent? What does this reveal?
- Citation patterns reveal **positionality**: Are you citing mainstream or marginal voices? Established or emerging scholars?

**Student activity**:
**Citation audit**: List all sources in your corpus. What patterns emerge? (Gender, race, publication date, discipline, methodology?) What voices are missing?

**Theoretical justification**:
Feminist citation politics (Ahmed): Citation is power—whose work gets amplified? Students must become conscious of citation choices as political acts.

---

### Metaphor 5: Citation as Affect

**Core concept**: Citations embody **relationships**—respect, critique, solidarity, gratitude, distance, challenge.

**Why this matters**:
- **Generosity**: Citation acknowledges intellectual debt
- **Critique**: Citation with refutation engages respectfully with opposing view
- **Community**: Citation builds networks of mutual recognition
- **Erasure**: Failure to cite is political and ethical problem

**Pedagogical application**:
- Frame citations as **conversations**, not evidence-gathering
- How you introduce source reveals relationship:
  - "As Salvatori brilliantly argues..." (respect, alignment)
  - "While Elbow contends..., I find..." (respectful disagreement)
  - "Critics such as X have noted..." (distancing, critique)

**Student activity**:
**SEAR analysis** (Situate, Embed, Analyze, Relate):
- **Situate**: Who is this author? What's their expertise?
- **Embed**: Quote/paraphrase with attribution
- **Analyze**: What does this source do for my thinking?
- **Relate**: How does this connect to other sources/my argument?

**Theoretical justification**:
Porter's "intertextuality": Writing is inherently collaborative. Citations make visible the usually invisible labor of building on others' work.

## BEAM Taxonomy as Dependency Types

**BEAM** (Bizup) categorizes **how sources function** in student writing:

| Type | Function | Dependency Relationship |
|------|----------|------------------------|
| **B**ackground | Provides context, definitions, general knowledge | Weak dependency: Could substitute other sources |
| **E**xhibit | Primary source being analyzed or discussed | Strong dependency: Argument requires *this* text |
| **A**rgument | Secondary source advancing claims | Dialogic dependency: Your thinking responds to theirs |
| **M**ethod | Provides procedures, frameworks, or approaches | Structural dependency: Borrowed intellectual tools |

**Pedagogical value**: 

BEAM makes **type of dependency** explicit. Students learn:
- Not all sources carry same weight
- Different citation types serve different rhetorical purposes
- "More sources" ≠ better argument; **appropriate sources** matter

**Implementation**:
- Students tag fragments with BEAM categories during M2
- Portfolio requirement: Demonstrate all four BEAM types across corpus
- Reflection prompt: "Which BEAM type was hardest to incorporate? Why?"

---

## Citation Work Across the Semester

### Movement 1 (Weeks 1-3): Implicit Citation

**Approach**: Students don't cite formally yet, but practice **naming influences**.

**Activities**:
- Freewrite after reading: "What ideas from Ong are bouncing around your head?"
- Fragment prompts: "This idea came from..." (informal attribution)

**Rationale**: Build habit of acknowledging sources before learning formatting mechanics.

---

### Movement 2 (Weeks 4-7): Explicit Citation

**Approach**: Introduce formal citation through Zotero + BEAM taxonomy.

**Activities**:
- Zotero workshop (Block 1 of Week 5): Import sources, generate bibliography
- BEAM tagging: Categorize how each source functions
- SEAR practice: Integrate sources with Situate/Embed/Analyze/Relate structure

**Rationale**: Separate **tool use** (Zotero automates format) from **rhetorical work** (choosing how to integrate source).

---

### Movement 3 (Weeks 8-11): Strategic Citation

**Approach**: Students manage multiple sources across corpus, develop citation patterns.

**Activities**:
- Citation audit: Analyze patterns in your corpus
- Cross-fragment citation: How do fragments cite common sources differently?
- Documented inquiry: Pursue question requiring synthesis of 5+ sources

**Rationale**: Move from isolated citation instances to **citation strategy** across corpus.

---

### Movement 4 (Weeks 12-15): Reflective Citation

**Approach**: Students articulate **why** they cited particular sources.

**Activities**:
- Portfolio introduction: "The works cited page tells the story of my inquiry"
- Process archaeology: "How did my relationship to X source change over semester?"
- Transfer reflection: "What citation practices from this course apply elsewhere?"

**Rationale**: Metacognitive understanding of citation as rhetorical/ethical practice.

## Comparison to Traditional Citation Pedagogy

### Traditional Approach

| Focus | Pedagogy | Result |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Format | Teach MLA/APA rules | Students anxious about mechanics |
| Plagiarism | Emphasize "don't steal" | Citations become defensive, not generative |
| Quantity | "At least 5 sources" | Students pad bibliography |
| Location | Citation relegated to bibliography | Disconnected from argument |

### VIRENS Citation-as-Dependency Approach

| Focus | Pedagogy | Result |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Relationship | Citations embody intellectual connections | Students see sources as conversation partners |
| Integration | SEAR protocol for weaving sources into thinking | Citations integrated throughout text |
| Function | BEAM taxonomy for source purposes | Students deploy sources strategically |
| Reflection | Citation choices as rhetorical decisions | Metacognitive awareness of practice |

## Implementation Challenges

### Challenge 1: Zotero Learning Curve

**Issue**: Tool complexity could overshadow conceptual work.

**Mitigation**:
- 1-block workshop: Minimal instruction, focus on core functions (import, cite, generate bibliography)
- Tech-comfortable students support peers (planned partnership)
- Zotero handles mechanics so class time addresses meaning

---

### Challenge 2: "But I Don't Understand the Source"

**Issue**: Students cite without comprehension, hoping to sound scholarly.

**Mitigation**:
- SEAR protocol **requires** analysis: Can't complete "Analyze" step without understanding
- Peer review asks: "Does writer demonstrate understanding of source?"
- BEAM tagging: Can't categorize function without grasping content
- Background sources (dictionaries, encyclopedias) acceptable for concepts student doesn't fully grasp

---

### Challenge 3: Citation Inequity

**Issue**: Students from under-resourced backgrounds may have less exposure to citation practices.

**Mitigation**:
- Explicit instruction (not assuming prior knowledge)
- Zotero reduces technical barriers
- Peer review normalizes variety of citation approaches
- Process documentation values learning, not just final product

---

## Evidence to Collect

### Evidence This Is Working

- [ ] Students use BEAM categories accurately in tagging
- [ ] Citation patterns show strategic deployment, not padding
- [ ] Portfolio introductions discuss citation choices meaningfully
- [ ] Students demonstrate understanding of citation as rhetorical practice

### Revision Notes

<!-- After pilot: What worked, what needs adjustment -->

[PLACEHOLDER: Post-pilot analysis]

- Monitor: Do BEAM categories help or create new confusion?
- Assess: Is SEAR protocol scaffolding source integration effectively?
- Adjust: Should Zotero workshop happen earlier? Later? Multiple sessions?
