## Design Philosophy

### Core Pedagogical Principle

Class time is organized into three primary modes—**Writing (W), Peer Review (P), and Revision (R)**—plus supporting categories. This W/P/R rhythm makes the labor of writing visible and accountable, ensures balanced attention to all phases of composing, and creates predictable patterns students can anticipate and prepare for.

The W/P/R framework treats **writing as labor** that requires dedicated time allocation, not just homework to squeeze in around other commitments. By making these modes explicit in course design, we signal that revision is as important as initial drafting, and that peer review is substantive intellectual work, not a checkbox activity.

### Theoretical Grounding

**Key Sources:**
- Sommers, Nancy. "Revision Strategies of Student Writers and Experienced Adult Writers" (revision as re-seeing, not copyediting)
- Elbow, Peter. *Writing with Power* (freewriting as generative practice)
- Bruffee, Kenneth. "Collaborative Learning and the 'Conversation of Mankind'" (peer interaction as knowledge-making)
- Anson, Chris. "Response Styles and Ways of Knowing" (how feedback shapes revision)
- Bazerman, Charles. "Systems of Genres and the Enactment of Social Intentions" (writing as recursive, distributed activity)

**Concepts Applied:**
- **Process pedagogy**: All phases of composing deserve instructional attention
- **Social constructivism**: Peer review as collaborative meaning-making
- **Metacognition**: Named modes enable reflection on different types of writing work
- **Transfer**: Explicit categorization helps students recognize these activities in other contexts

---

## Rationale

### Why This Framing?

Traditional composition courses often treat writing as homework ("draft due next week") with class time for lecture or discussion. This model:
- Makes writing labor invisible (happens at home, unobserved)
- Positions revision as optional polishing (if time permits)
- Treats peer review as add-on activity (if we get to it)
- Creates equity issues (students with quiet study spaces, reliable technology, flexible schedules have advantages)

The W/P/R rhythm inverts this: **most writing happens in class**, making the labor visible, supportable, and part of the course's intellectual work. The flipped classroom model assigns reading for homework but reserves class time for writing.

**Time allocation across semester:**

| Mode | Total Blocks | Percentage | What This Signals |
|------|-------------|------------|-------------------|
| Writing (W) | 30-31 | 35-39% | Generative work is core activity |
| Peer Review (P) | 8-9 | 9-11% | Feedback is substantive, requires time |
| Revision (R) | 23-24 | 26-29% | Revision is as important as drafting |
| Tech (T) | 6 | 7-8% | Tool literacy matters but doesn't dominate |
| Instructor Feedback (I) | 3 | 3-4% | Targeted intervention at key moments |
| Other (—) | 18-20 | 20-24% | Conferences, presentations, flex |

### Theoretical Background

**Nancy Sommers's Revision Research:**

Sommers found that experienced writers revise to **re-see** their ideas, while novice writers revise primarily to **fix errors**. By dedicating 26-29% of class time to revision work, we signal that revision is substantive intellectual labor, not just copyediting. The "R" blocks give students time to:
- Process feedback from peers and instructor
- Identify patterns in their work
- Experiment with structural changes
- Develop revision strategies beyond sentence-level fixes

**Peter Elbow's Freewriting:**

Elbow demonstrated that low-stakes, ungraded generative writing helps writers discover ideas. The "W" blocks include both freewriting (M1-heavy) and structured drafting (M3-4). By protecting time for writing in class, we:
- Make invisible labor visible
- Provide immediate support when students get stuck
- Model that writing is work requiring dedicated time
- Create equity (all students have same access to quiet writing time)

**Kenneth Bruffee's Collaborative Learning:**

Bruffee argued that knowledge is socially constructed through conversation. The "P" blocks (8-9 across semester, concentrated in M2) position peer review as:
- Intellectual work requiring focused time
- Collaborative meaning-making, not just proofreading
- Practice in reading with writerly attention
- Reciprocal learning (reviewers learn by reading, writers learn by receiving feedback)

## W/P/R Rhythm Across Movements

The balance of W/P/R modes shifts across the four Movements to match pedagogical goals:

### Movement 1: Surfacing (Weeks 1-3) — W-Heavy

| Mode | Blocks | Character |
|------|--------|-----------|
| W | ~12-13 | Freewriting, exploratory drafting, index card capture |
| P | 0-1 | Minimal; students building corpus first |
| R | ~3-4 | Light revision, mostly categorizing |

**Rationale:** Students need **expansion time** before worrying about feedback. M1 emphasizes capture and volume (3-4 fragments/week). Introducing peer review too early risks:
- Premature closure (students defend early ideas rather than exploring)
- Anxiety about sharing underdeveloped work
- Misunderstanding peer review as evaluation rather than exploration

### Movement 2: Naming (Weeks 4-7) — Balanced W-P-R

| Mode | Blocks | Character |
|------|--------|-----------|
| W | ~8-9 | Structured generative writing with source engagement |
| P | ~4-5 | Introduction to Eli Review, structured feedback |
| R | ~7-8 | Processing feedback, source integration revision |

**Rationale:** Students now have corpus (12-20 fragments) ready for feedback. M2 introduces:
- **Eli Review cycles** (4-5 blocks for learning the system, giving feedback, reviewing feedback)
- **BEAM tagging practice** (classifying sources during writing)
- **Feedback-driven revision** (using peer comments to identify revision priorities)

This is the most **balanced** movement: roughly equal time for writing, reviewing, and revising. Students learn that these are distinct modes requiring different cognitive work.

### Movement 3: Operating at Scale (Weeks 8-11) — W+R Heavy

| Mode | Blocks | Character |
|------|--------|-----------|
| W | ~8-9 | Consolidation writing, connecting fragments |
| P | ~2-3 | Reduced; students have internalized feedback practices |
| R | ~10-11 | Extensive revision, corpus management |

**Rationale:** By M3, students have:
- Large corpus (30-42 fragments) requiring management
- Internalized peer review skills (can give useful feedback in less time)
- Need for **consolidation** (combining fragments, identifying patterns)

Revision blocks increase dramatically because students are:
- Processing accumulated feedback from M2
- Making corpus-level decisions (what to keep, cut, develop)
- Experimenting with organization and connection

### Movement 4: Synthesis (Weeks 12-15) — R-Heavy

| Mode | Blocks | Character |
|------|--------|-----------|
| W | ~2-3 | Minimal new generation; focused completion writing |
| P | ~1-2 | Targeted late-stage feedback |
| R | ~10-12 | Portfolio assembly, selection, final polish |

**Rationale:** M4 is primarily **revision and selection**. Students:
- Choose which fragments to develop for portfolio
- Polish selected pieces
- Write reflective apparatus (introduction, process archaeology)
- Finalize documentation

Minimal new writing because the work is **transformation** of existing material, not generation of new content.

## Audience Considerations

### Student Perspective

Students benefit from knowing the mode structure:
- **Predictability**: "Next class is revision time, so I should bring my peer feedback"
- **Permission**: "This is writing time, so I'm supposed to be drafting, not perfecting"
- **Transparency**: Mode labels make invisible labor visible on schedule

Students encounter modes through:
- **Schedule notation**: Each week's schedule shows W/P/R labels
- **In-class framing**: "We're in R mode today, so we're processing feedback, not generating new text"
- **Dev logs**: Students reflect on which modes were most/least productive for them

### Institutional Context

The W/P/R rhythm aligns with:
- **WPA Outcomes**: "Develop flexible strategies for reading, drafting, reviewing, collaborating, revising, rewriting, rereading, and editing"
- **High-impact practices**: Collaborative learning, writing-intensive coursework
- **Assessment transparency**: Clear allocation shows writing is valued work

It also provides **evidence-based justification** for flipped classroom model: "Class time is for the high-value work of writing/reviewing/revising; reading is preparation for that work."

## Alternative Approaches Considered

### Other Options

1. **Approach**: Don't label modes; just vary activities
   **Rejected because**: Lacks transparency; students don't recognize different types of work; harder to track balance across semester

2. **Approach**: Traditional model (writing as homework, class for discussion)
   **Rejected because**: Makes labor invisible; creates equity issues; doesn't provide support during composing

3. **Approach**: Writing workshop model (all class time is writing time)
   **Rejected because**: Undervalues peer review and revision; doesn't scaffold different types of work; risks "just write more" without reflection

4. **Approach**: Strict rotation (W-P-R-W-P-R every week)
   **Rejected because**: Doesn't match pedagogical needs of different Movements; artificially forces peer review before students have material worth reviewing

5. **Approach**: More granular categories (brainstorming, drafting, outlining, etc.)
   **Rejected because**: Too complex for 25-minute blocks; students lose clarity; harder to track and balance

## Connection to VIRENS Principles

The W/P/R rhythm implements several VIRENS design principles:

| VIRENS Principle | Application in W/P/R |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| **C19: Value Accumulation** | W time creates fragments that accumulate value; R time transforms accumulated material |
| **B10: Manual Trigger Points** | Mode boundaries are human-triggered (instructor declares mode, students shift cognitive stance) |
| **B14: Graceful Degradation** | If one mode fails (e.g., tech problems in P), other modes still function |
| **A03: Process as First-Class Object** | W/P/R makes process visible and discussable, not just implicit |

The rhythm also connects to [[six-moves-vocabulary-reasons-v101|six-moves vocabulary]]:

| W/P/R Mode | Emphasizes These Moves |
|-----------|------------------------|
| **W** (Writing) | Capture, Classify (early); Connect, Publish (late) |
| **P** (Peer Review) | Classify (identifying what type of feedback), Connect (linking comments to patterns) |
| **R** (Revision) | Distill (extracting core ideas), Route (deciding where material belongs) |

## Implementation Considerations

### In Weekly Planning

Each week's plan specifies mode distribution:

**Example (Week 5, M2):**
- Mon: W (25 min) + P (25 min) — Write new fragment, intro to Eli Review
- Wed: R (50 min) — Process peer feedback from Eli, revise fragments
- Fri: W (50 min) — Source integration practice, new fragment with BEAM tags

### In Student Communication

Mode labels appear on:
- **Course calendar**: Weekly view shows W/P/R distribution
- **Assignment sheets**: "This will require 2 W blocks and 1 R block"
- **In-class transitions**: "We're shifting into R mode now"

### In Assessment

Students can be evaluated on engagement with all three modes:
- Participation grade based on active engagement in W/P/R time
- Dev logs document work across modes
- Portfolio reflects transformation through revision (R mode evidence)

---

## Evidence & Iteration

### Evidence to Collect

- [ ] Track actual time usage: do W/P/R blocks match planned distribution?
- [ ] Student end-of-semester surveys: which mode was most/least valuable?
- [ ] Analyze participation: are students equally engaged in all three modes?
- [ ] Review dev logs: do students recognize and name different modes?
- [ ] Monitor equity: does in-class writing time reduce completion gap?

### Revision Notes

**Potential adjustments based on implementation:**

- If students struggle to shift between modes quickly, consider longer blocks or transition activities
- If P time feels rushed, consider reducing number of peer review cycles but lengthening each
- If R time becomes unfocused, provide more structure (revision protocols, peer revision consultations)
- If mode labels feel bureaucratic, consider more evocative names (students suggested "making, sharing, improving" in pilot)
