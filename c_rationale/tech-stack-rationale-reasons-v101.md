# Justification: Tech Stack Rationale (Path A)

> [!abstract] Pedagogical Rationale
> **Component**: Rationale
> **Track**: Justification (why these choices)
> **Paired with**: Multiple tech stack content notes
> **Status**: Complete

## Design Philosophy

### Core Pedagogical Principle

The tech stack embodies **constraint sequencing** applied to tool learning: students encounter tools when they need them for real work, not before. Each tool introduction is timed to the pedagogical demands of that Movement, and students build fluency through repeated practice before stakes increase.

The stack also operationalizes the course's **process documentation** commitment. By making workflow visible across multiple tools (cards, folders, Zotero, Eli), students see writing as both labor (the Six Moves) and capital (the accumulated corpus).

---

## Theoretical Grounding

### Composition Pedagogy

**Selber's [[@selber2004multi]] "Multiliteracies Framework" (2004)**:
- **Functional literacy**: Students learn tools to accomplish tasks
- **Critical literacy**: Students understand tool affordances and limitations
- **Rhetorical literacy**: Students make strategic choices about which tools to use when

The course moves students through all three levels. Week 2 is functional (learn the interface). Week 8 is critical (understand what digital organization affords vs. cards). Week 13 is rhetorical (choose tools based on writing needs).

**Situated Learning Theory (Lave & Wenger)**:
Tools are learned in context, not in abstract. Students don't get "Zotero training" divorced from writing—they learn Zotero when they're actively citing sources for fragments. This reduces cognitive load and increases retention.

---

### Systems Thinking

**Meadows's [[@meadows2008lever]] "Leverage Points" (1999)**:
The tech stack targets multiple leverage points:
- **Information flows** (naming conventions make fragments findable)
- **Feedback loops** (Eli Review helpfulness ratings create accountability)
- **System structure** (folder hierarchy mirrors Movement structure)

**Alexander's [[@alexander1964notet]] "Misfits" (Notes on the Synthesis of Form)**:
Each tool is chosen to address specific frictions in the traditional composition classroom:
- **Misfit**: Students lose track of early ideas
  **Tool**: Index cards capture and preserve everything
- **Misfit**: Peer feedback is vague and unhelpful
  **Tool**: Eli Review prompts and helpfulness ratings structure feedback
- **Misfit**: Students don't see connections between sources
  **Tool**: Zotero BEAM tagging makes source types visible

---

### Learning Science

**Cognitive Load Theory (Sweller)**:
Tech instruction is distributed across the semester (6 blocks + 5 touches) to avoid overwhelming students. Each tool is introduced when working memory has space for it.

**Spaced Repetition**:
Touches (Weeks 6, 7, 10, 11, 12) reinforce tool use without re-teaching. Students practice, drift, get reminded, practice again. This cycle builds automaticity.

---

## Why Path A (Eli-Centered)?

### Decision Factors

The course design process evaluated three paths:
1. **Path A: Eli-Centered** (Index cards + OneDrive + Zotero + Eli Review)
2. **Path B: OneNote-Centered** (OneNote + OneDrive + Zotero + Canvas peer review)
3. **Path C: Hybrid/Advanced** (Path A + optional Obsidian for interested students)

**Path A was chosen because**:

1. **Proven Pedagogy**: Eli Review is backed by composition research (e.g., Patchan et al. on structured peer review; Cho & MacArthur on helpfulness ratings improving review quality). It's not experimental.

2. **Lower Development Burden**: Eli Review comes with training materials, rubrics, and analytics. Instructor doesn't need to build these from scratch.

3. **Separation of Concerns**: Each tool does one job well. Index cards for capture, OneDrive for storage, Zotero for citation, Eli for feedback. This modularity means if one tool fails, others still work.

4. **Adoptable by Others**: Other instructors can implement Path A without heavy customization. The folder structure and naming conventions are generalizable.

5. **Tactile Grounding**: Index cards provide physical engagement that purely digital systems lack. Research on "embodied cognition" (Wilson, 2002) suggests physical manipulation aids conceptual understanding.

---

### Tradeoffs Accepted

**Cost**: Eli Review costs $20/student. Canvas peer review is free.

**Why worth it**: Eli's helpfulness ratings and analytics create accountability that informal peer review lacks. Students learn to distinguish actionable feedback from vague commentary, which is a transferable skill.

**Complexity**: Five tools means five potential points of friction.

**Why worth it**: Real-world writing environments are multi-tool. Learning to integrate tools is itself a literacy. The course makes tool integration explicit rather than assuming it.

**Manual Integration**: Students must transfer cards to digital, manually insert Zotero citations, manually upload to Eli and Canvas.

**Why worth it**: Automation hides process. Manual integration keeps process visible and forces students to make intentional choices. This aligns with the course's **constraint sequencing** principle—students learn what they're automating before automation is introduced (Week 8's "What You're Automating" session).

---

## Tool-by-Tool Justification

### Index Cards

**Pedagogical purpose**: Fast capture with minimal friction; physical sorting enables kinesthetic thinking

**Research backing**:
- Mueller & Oppenheimer (2014): Handwriting aids retention vs. typing
- Embodied cognition research: Physical manipulation of objects aids abstract reasoning
- Composition lore: Index cards are standard practice for thesis generation and outline planning

**Constraint sequencing logic**: Introduced Week 2 before digital systems. Students experience low-tech capture, then appreciate digital affordances when introduced Week 8.

**Alternative considered**: Digital note-taking only (OneNote, Google Keep)
**Why rejected**: Loses tactile engagement; students default to copy-paste rather than synthesis

---

### OneDrive + Word

**Pedagogical purpose**: Ubiquitous storage with version history and cross-platform access

**Research backing**:
- Version history allows students to see their revision process (Reynolds, 2004)
- Institutional tools (Word) reduce friction vs. requiring students learn new platform
- Cloud storage ensures work isn't lost (reduces anxiety, increases risk-taking)

**Constraint sequencing logic**: Folder structure introduced Week 2 but isn't enforced rigorously until Week 8 when corpus reaches scale (~25 fragments). Early laxity allows experimentation; later tightening ensures findability.

**Alternative considered**: Google Docs + Drive
**Why not rejected**: Functionally equivalent. Choice depends on institutional license.

---

### Zotero

**Pedagogical purpose**: Formal citation management; BEAM tagging as heuristic for source types

**Research backing**:
- Bizup's BEAM framework (2008) helps students categorize sources rhetorically, not just format citations
- Zotero is free, cross-platform, and widely used in academia (transferable skill)
- Library staff often already teach Zotero (reduces instructor burden)

**Constraint sequencing logic**: Introduced Week 5 when source-based writing intensifies. Week 4 has source-based writing WITHOUT Zotero to create "before/after" comparison. Students cite informally first, then learn formal citation when it becomes necessary.

**Alternative considered**: EasyBib, Citation Machine
**Why rejected**: Don't support BEAM tagging; proprietary; less professional

---

### Eli Review

**Pedagogical purpose**: Structured peer feedback with helpfulness ratings and analytics

**Research backing**:
- Patchan et al. (2009): Structured prompts improve review quality vs. open-ended "give feedback"
- Cho & MacArthur (2010): Helpfulness ratings increase reviewer accountability
- Eli Review's own research: Students who rate feedback as "Very Helpful" revise more substantively

**Constraint sequencing logic**:
- Week 2: Ungraded familiarization (just touch the interface)
- Week 5: First graded cycle (3 weeks after familiarization)
- Weeks 5-15: 6 graded cycles with increasing sophistication

**Alternative considered**: Canvas peer review
**Why rejected**: No helpfulness ratings; no analytics; less structured prompts

---

### Canvas

**Pedagogical purpose**: Institutional submission and gradebook

**Research backing**: N/A (administrative tool, not pedagogical)

**Constraint sequencing logic**: Canvas is transparent infrastructure. Students submit throughout semester but Canvas isn't "taught"—it's assumed background.

**Alternative**: None. Canvas is institutional requirement.

---

## Naming Convention Rationale

### Why `YYYY-MM-DD-topic-slug-status.docx`?

**Date-first**:
- Files sort chronologically in file explorer
- Accumulation becomes visible (students see corpus growing)
- Supports "writing as capital" metaphor—dated fragments are like dated entries in ledger

**Topic-slug**:
- 2-4 word description enables search
- Forces students to name what they're doing (metacognition)
- Example: `salvatori-difficulty` is more findable than `fragment-17`

**Status**:
- `draft`, `revised`, `polished`, `submitted`
- Tracks workflow state without needing external tracking system
- Supports version control narrative (students see progression)

**Research backing**:
- Information architecture research: Consistent naming conventions reduce cognitive load when navigating file systems
- Composition pedagogy: Naming forces metacognition (students must articulate what fragment is about)

---

## Folder Structure Rationale

### Why Mirror Course Movements?

```
01-Fragments/
  ├── M1-Surfacing/
  ├── M2-Naming/
  ├── M3-Scale/
  └── M4-Synthesis/
```

**Pedagogical purpose**: Folder structure reinforces conceptual architecture of course. Students internalize Movement names through repeated folder navigation.

**Alternative considered**: Organize by topic, by date, by assignment
**Why rejected**: 
- Topic-based: Topics emerge slowly; hard to implement early
- Date-based: Doesn't reinforce Movement concepts
- Assignment-based: Ties fragments too closely to specific assignments; discourages reuse

---

## Dev Log Format Rationale

### Why "What I did / What happened / What I learned"?

**Pedagogical purpose**: Three-part structure scaffolds reflection without over-constraining

**Research backing**:
- Schön's "reflection-in-action" (1983): Practitioners learn by articulating process
- Yancey's [[@yancey1998refle]] "reflection in the writing classroom" (1998): Structured reflection prompts deepen learning

**Constraint sequencing logic**: Format introduced Week 2, required 2×/week. Early entries may be thin; depth develops as semester progresses.

**Alternative considered**: Freeform journal
**Why rejected**: Students struggle with blank page; prompts reduce anxiety

---

## Tech Instruction Timing

### Why These Weeks?

| Week | Tech Event | Rationale |
|------|------------|-----------|
| 2 | Index cards, folder structure | Establish baseline system before accumulation begins |
| 2 | Eli familiarization (ungraded) | "Familiarize before stakes"—know interface before performance matters |
| 5 | Zotero (library session) | Source work intensifies; formal citation now necessary |
| 5 | First graded Eli cycle | 3 weeks after familiarization; students ready for stakes |
| 8 | Digital transfer | Corpus at ~25 fragments; scale justifies digital organization |
| 13 | Advanced tools (optional) | Near semester's end; students have mastery context |

**Principle**: "Tech follows content." Tools arrive when writing demands them, not before.

---

## Touch Reminders Rationale

### Why Not Full Re-Teaching?

Touches (5-10 min embedded check-ins) assume prior learning. They address drift, not introduce new concepts.

**Research backing**:
- Spaced repetition: Retrieval practice strengthens memory (Roediger & Butler, 2011)
- "Desirable difficulties" (Bjork): Spacing creates friction that aids retention

**Weeks 6, 7, 10, 11, 12**: Strategic spacing across semester. Not evenly distributed because needs vary (e.g., Zotero check-in Week 6 when students are actively citing; portfolio logistics Week 12 when assembly begins).

---

## What Students Gain

By semester's end, students should:

1. **Functional Tool Literacy**: Know how to use each tool for its designated purpose
2. **Critical Tool Awareness**: Understand what each tool affords and what it constrains
3. **Rhetorical Tool Selection**: Choose tools based on writing task, not habit or convenience
4. **Process Visibility**: Articulate their own writing process via documentation
5. **Corpus Management**: Navigate 40-50 fragments efficiently
6. **Peer Review Literacy**: Distinguish helpful feedback from vague commentary

---

## Evidence to Collect

### Formative Assessment

- [ ] Week 2: Do students complete Eli practice task?
- [ ] Week 5: Are Zotero citations appearing in fragments?
- [ ] Week 8: Do dev logs reflect on digital transfer?
- [ ] Week 12: Can students find fragments within 30 seconds?

### Summative Assessment

- [ ] Eli Review helpfulness ratings: Are students giving "Very Helpful" feedback by semester's end?
- [ ] Portfolio reflections: Do students articulate their process using system vocabulary?
- [ ] Final dev logs: Do students demonstrate tool fluency?
