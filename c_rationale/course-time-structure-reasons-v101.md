## Design Philosophy

### Core Pedagogical Principle

Course design at the **block level** (25-minute units) rather than session level (50/75/150-minute periods) creates maximum flexibility across different scheduling formats while maintaining pedagogical coherence. This granular approach enables:

- **Activity-level planning** that can be reconfigured for different meeting patterns
- **Mode visibility** that makes types of work (Writing/Peer Review/Revision) explicit
- **Realistic time accounting** that acknowledges actual available instructional time
- **Transferable structure** that other instructors can adapt to their contexts

The 90-block semester (62 available after subtractions) provides a realistic planning constraint rather than an idealized "15 weeks = plenty of time" assumption.

### Theoretical Grounding

**Key Sources:**
- Wiggins, Grant and Jay McTighe. *Understanding by Design* (backward design from time constraints)
- Lang, James. *Small Teaching* (attention spans and activity chunking)
- Bain, Ken. *What the Best College Teachers Do* (realistic planning vs. coverage fallacy)
- Nilson, Linda. *Teaching at Its Best* (class session structure and pacing)

**Concepts Applied:**
- **Backward design**: Start with available time, work backward to achievable outcomes
- **Cognitive load management**: 25-minute blocks match sustained attention capacity
- **Visible structure**: Named modes enable metacognition about types of work
- **Configurability**: Same pedagogical principles work across multiple schedule formats

---

## Rationale

### Why Block-Level Design?

**Problem with session-level planning:**

Traditional course design plans at the session level:
- "Week 3: Discuss rhetorical analysis"
- "Week 7: Peer review day"
- "Week 12: Conferences"

This approach:
- **Obscures actual time available** (how much of "Week 3" is discussion vs. other activities?)
- **Lacks granularity** for activity planning (how long does peer review actually take?)
- **Doesn't transfer** across different scheduling formats (MWF 50-min vs. TR 75-min vs. once-weekly 150-min)
- **Enables coverage fallacy** ("we'll cover X, Y, and Z" without time accounting)

**Block-level design solution:**

Planning in 25-minute blocks:
- **Makes time visible**: "This activity requires 2 blocks (50 min)"
- **Enables reconfiguration**: Blocks can be grouped differently for different schedules
- **Forces realism**: Can't fit 10 blocks of activities into 6-block week
- **Supports activity design**: Each block has clear objective achievable in 25 minutes

### Why 25 Minutes?

**Cognitive attention research:**

James Lang's *Small Teaching* synthesizes research showing:
- Sustained focused attention typically lasts 15-25 minutes
- Brief breaks restore attention more effectively than longer breaks after longer sessions
- Chunking activities into sub-30-minute units improves retention

**Pomodoro technique parallel:**

The productivity method uses 25-minute focused work intervals. Students already familiar with this concept can transfer that knowledge to classroom structure.

**Practical divisibility:**

25 minutes divides evenly into common class periods:
- 50 minutes = 2 blocks + brief transition
- 75 minutes = 3 blocks + 2 short breaks
- 150 minutes = 6 blocks + 5 short breaks

### Why 90 Total Blocks (Not 96)?

**Realistic accounting of lost time:**

A "15-week semester" is never actually 15 full weeks of instruction:

| Lost Time | Blocks | Reason |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Holiday/campus events | 2 | Thanksgiving, campus closure, etc. |
| Conference week | 6 | Week 9 one-on-one meetings |
| Presentations | 6 | Week 14 sharing work |
| Library session | 2 | Embedded librarian visit |
| Envelope exercise | 2 | Week 1 and Week 15 special activities |
| Syllabus day | 2 | First day orientation |
| Tech instruction | 6 | Zotero, Eli Review, file management |
| Flex buffer | 2 | Backup for when things run long |
| **Total lost** | **28** | **Nearly 5 full weeks!** |

**Result: 90 - 28 = 62 available blocks**

This realistic accounting prevents:
- **Overambitious planning** ("we'll do X, Y, and Z" when time doesn't exist)
- **End-of-semester panic** ("where did all the time go?")
- **Cutting important activities** (revision time sacrificed to "cover" content)

### Why Visible Mode Labels (W/P/R)?

**Transparency and metacognition:**

When students see "W block" on schedule, they:
- Know to bring materials for writing (laptop, index cards)
- Shift into generative rather than evaluative mindset
- Recognize writing as valued work requiring protected time
- Understand that writing isn't just homework but in-class labor

**Theoretical grounding:**

Yancey's [[@yancey1998refle]] research on reflection emphasizes that metacognition requires **naming** what we're doing. Mode labels externalize process:
- "I struggled during R blocks this week" = specific, actionable observation
- "I didn't do well this week" = vague, hard to address

**Equity considerations:**

Protecting class time for writing (W blocks) and revision (R blocks) creates equity:
- Students without quiet home study spaces still have dedicated writing time
- Students with work/care responsibilities don't have to find extra hours for revision
- Process work is valued equally with product work

## Audience Considerations

### Student Perspective

**Initial confusion:**

Students accustomed to "class = lecture" or "class = discussion" may initially find block structure:
- **Over-structured**: "Why label everything?"
- **Unfamiliar**: "Other classes don't do this"
- **Rigid**: "What if I'm not in the right mode?"

**Support strategies:**

- **Week 1 orientation**: Explicit explanation of why blocks matter (see [[course-time-structure-course-v101]])
- **Consistent schedule**: Publish full semester block schedule so students can anticipate
- **Dev log reflection**: Students reflect on which blocks were productive, building metacognitive awareness
- **Mid-semester check**: "How's the block structure working for you?" adjustment opportunity

**Long-term benefits:**

Students report (in pilots) that block structure:
- Helps them **prepare mentally** for different types of work
- Makes **progress visible** (can count how many W blocks they've completed)
- **Transfers** to other courses and work (time-boxing as skill)
- Creates **permission** to focus ("this block is for writing, not multitasking")

### Instructor Perspective

**Planning efficiency:**

Block-level design enables:
- **Modular activity library**: Create 25-minute activities that can be combined
- **Quick reconfiguration**: Swap 2 W blocks for 2 R blocks if class needs more revision time
- **Transparent load**: "This assignment requires 4 blocks of class time" makes trade-offs visible
- **Reusability**: Activities designed for 25-minute blocks work across different course schedules

**Adaptation for different schedules:**

Same course design works for:
- **MWF 50-minute**: 2 blocks per session, 3 sessions/week
- **TR 75-minute**: 3 blocks per session, 2 sessions/week  
- **Once-weekly 150-minute**: All 6 blocks in one marathon session

Pedagogical coherence maintained because **blocks, not sessions, are the design unit**.

### Institutional Context

**Alignment with institutional goals:**

- **High-impact practices**: Structured time for writing-intensive work, collaborative learning
- **Student success**: Realistic time allocation supports completion
- **Assessment transparency**: Clear connection between time investment and outcomes
- **Faculty development**: Transferable model other instructors can adopt

**Departmental scalability:**

Block structure enables:
- **Common curriculum** across different schedules (MWF vs. TR vs. once-weekly)
- **Clear time accounting** for multi-section coordination
- **Observable instruction** (other instructors can see what happens in each block)
- **Evidence-based revision** (track which blocks work, which don't)

## Alternative Approaches Considered

### Other Options

1. **Approach**: Session-level planning (traditional "Week X: Topic Y")
   **Rejected because**: Lacks granularity; doesn't account for lost time; obscures actual instructional time

2. **Approach**: Strict 50-minute or 75-minute units (rather than 25-minute blocks)
   **Rejected because**: Less flexible; doesn't acknowledge attention span research; harder to reconfigure

3. **Approach**: No time structure—responsive/emergent design
   **Rejected because**: Creates planning instability; students can't anticipate work; hard to ensure balanced W/P/R

4. **Approach**: Even finer granularity (15-minute blocks)
   **Rejected because**: Too fragmented; excessive transitions; planning overhead too high

5. **Approach**: Different block sizes for different activities (30-min writing, 20-min peer review, etc.)
   **Rejected because**: Loses simplicity; harder to reconfigure; cognitive overhead of tracking variable units

6. **Approach**: Don't track lost time—just design for "15 weeks"
   **Rejected because**: Leads to overambitious plans, end-of-semester compression, cutting important work

## Connection to VIRENS Principles

Block-level design implements several VIRENS principles:

| VIRENS Principle | Application in Block Structure |
|-----------------|-------------------------------|
| **A04: Make Tacit Explicit** | Time usage is visible, not hidden in "class time" |
| **B13: Graceful Degradation** | If one block fails, others continue; no cascading failure |
| **B14: Modularity** | Blocks are modular units that can be rearranged |
| **C20: Realistic Constraints** | 62 available blocks forces realistic planning |

The block system also parallels **sprint planning** in agile development: small units of work, visible progress, regular reflection and adjustment.

## Implementation Considerations

### Weekly Planning Template

Each week specifies:
- **Block 1**: [Mode] — [Activity] — [Materials needed]
- **Block 2**: [Mode] — [Activity] — [Materials needed]
- [etc. through Block 6]

**Example (Week 5):**
- **Block 1**: W — Freewriting on Meadows [[@meadows2008lever]] reading — Laptop or notebook
- **Block 2**: W — Develop freewriting into fragment — Laptop, Meadows reading
- **Block 3**: P — Introduction to Eli Review — Laptop, wifi access
- **Block 4**: P — Practice structured feedback — Access to Eli Review
- **Block 5**: R — Review received feedback — Eli Review access
- **Block 6**: R — Revise one fragment — Laptop, peer comments

### Communicating to Students

**In syllabus:**
- Full semester block breakdown (90 blocks → 62 available → W/P/R distribution)
- Explanation of why blocks matter
- How to prepare for different modes

**In weekly schedule:**
- Visual block layout for upcoming week
- Mode labels clearly marked
- Materials/prep needed for each block

**In class:**
- Announce mode at start of each block
- Brief transition time between blocks (1-2 minutes)
- Meta-commentary when useful ("This R block might feel different from last week's because...")

### Adjusting Mid-Semester

**Flexibility within structure:**

While overall block budget is fixed, **allocation can shift** based on needs:
- If peer review taking longer than planned, reallocate Tech blocks → P blocks
- If students need more revision time, shift W blocks → R blocks
- Flex buffer (2 blocks) available for emergencies

**Evidence for adjustment:**
- Student dev logs: "R blocks feel rushed"
- Observation: activities consistently running over planned time
- Mid-semester assessment: "We need more peer review practice"

---

## Evidence & Iteration

### Evidence to Collect

- [ ] Track actual time usage: do blocks run as planned or consistently over/under?
- [ ] Student feedback: does block structure feel helpful or constraining?
- [ ] Compare sections: do different schedules (MWF vs. TR vs. once-weekly) work equally well?
- [ ] Monitor completion: does realistic time accounting improve assignment completion rates?
- [ ] Faculty adoption: can other instructors successfully implement block structure?

### Revision Notes

**Potential adjustments based on implementation:**

- If 25 minutes proves too short for certain activities, consider 30-minute blocks (5 blocks/week instead of 6)
- If transitions between blocks feel abrupt, build in 3-5 minute explicit transition time
- If students don't attend to mode labels, make them more salient (color-coding, visual icons)
- If some activities consistently need 1.5 blocks (37.5 min), develop "extended block" protocol
- If lost time calculation proves inaccurate, revise for future semesters based on actual data
