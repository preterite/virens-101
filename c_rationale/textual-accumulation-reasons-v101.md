## Design Philosophy

### Core Pedagogical Principle

Writing is both **labor (verb)** and **capital (noun)**. Students accumulate a corpus of 40-50 **fragments** (150-400 word pieces, each containing one claim with supporting evidence) throughout the semester rather than completing discrete, episodic assignments. This accumulation model values **daily practice** over occasional performance, treats **writing as material** that compounds in value, and enables **revision as selection and connection** rather than just polishing.

The fragment model embodies a fundamental shift: from "complete Assignment X by Due Date Y" to "build a corpus through consistent practice, then curate what deserves development." This approach aligns with how writers actually work—accumulating notes, drafts, and ideas over time—rather than the artificial episodic model of traditional assignments.

### Theoretical Grounding

**Key Sources:**
- Sommers, Nancy and Laura Saltz [[@sommers2004novid]]. "The Novice as Expert: Writing the Freshman Year." *College Composition and Communication* (2004): Students need time for ideas to develop; compression into discrete units prevents depth
- Wardle, Elizabeth. "Understanding 'Transfer' from FYC." *WPA: Writing Program Administration* (2007): Transfer requires practice over time, not episodic demonstration
- Yancey, Kathleen Blake. "Portfolios, Reflection, and What We Have Learned." *The Writing Portfolio: Theory and Practice* (2016): Portfolio pedagogy values accumulated work, but traditional approach still episodic
- Perl [[@perl1979compp]], Sondra. "The Composing Processes of Unskilled College Writers." *Research in the Teaching of English* (1979): Recursive processes require time and accumulation
- Berkenkotter, Carol. "Decisions and Revisions: The Planning Strategies of a Publishing Writer." *College Composition and Communication* (1983): Expert writers maintain ongoing textual corpus

**Concepts Applied:**
- **Distributed practice**: Learning science shows spaced repetition more effective than massed practice
- **Accumulation over episodes**: Value compounds through consistent practice rather than occasional high-stakes performance
- **Portfolio as living document**: Not collection of finished pieces but curated selection from larger corpus
- **Writing as capital**: Text produced has ongoing value, not just submission-date value

---

## Rationale

### Why This Framing?

**Traditional assignment model:**
- Essay 1 (draft due X, revision due Y) → move on
- Essay 2 (draft due A, revision due B) → move on  
- Essay 3 (draft due M, revision due N) → move on
- Final portfolio: collect Essay 1-3 + reflection

**Problems with this model:**
1. **Episodic completion**: Each essay is treated as discrete unit; once "done," writers move on mentally
2. **Artificial closure**: Real writing doesn't have clear endpoints; ideas continue developing
3. **Lost labor**: Exploratory writing discarded; only "final" products valued
4. **Transfer limitation**: Skills practiced only in high-stakes contexts don't transfer well
5. **Equity issues**: Students with stable schedules and resources can manage deadline spikes; others struggle

**Accumulation model:**
- **Week 1-3**: Generate 8-12 fragments through freewriting, card exercises, literacy narrative work
- **Week 4-7**: Add 12-16 more fragments through source engagement, spec documents, constraint experiments
- **Week 8-11**: Add 10-14 fragments, consolidate and connect existing material
- **Week 12-15**: Minimal new generation; select and develop ~12-15 fragments for final portfolio

**Advantages:**
1. **Consistent practice**: 3-4 fragments/week = sustainable rhythm, builds habit
2. **Ongoing value**: Early fragments remain available for later development
3. **Visible accumulation**: Students can see corpus growing, track progress quantitatively
4. **Revision as selection**: "What deserves development?" rather than "fix this thing"
5. **Multiple pathways**: Fragment that doesn't work for one purpose might work for another

### Theoretical Background

**Nancy Sommers and Laura Saltz (2004):**

Their longitudinal study found that student writers improved most when they could **return to ideas over time**. The traditional episodic model (finish Essay 1, start Essay 2) prevented this recursion. Accumulation model enables:
- Returning to earlier fragments with new insights
- Seeing connections between fragments written weeks apart
- Treating "finished" work as still-developing material

**Elizabeth Wardle (2007):**

Wardle demonstrated that transfer requires **varied practice over time**—not mastery in one high-stakes context, but flexible application across multiple contexts. Fragments provide this:
- 40-50 attempts at "claim + evidence" structure (vs. 3 attempts in traditional model)
- Multiple genres (freewriting, source engagement, constraint experiments)
- Low stakes enable experimentation; high volume enables pattern recognition

**Carol Berkenkotter (1983):**

Berkenkotter's case study of a publishing writer showed extensive **textual recycling**: material written for one project often found use in another; "finished" pieces were revisited and revised years later. The fragment model teaches this professional practice:
- Nothing is truly finished; everything remains available
- Value accumulates through reuse and recombination
- Selection matters as much as generation

## Fragment Specifications

### Size and Structure

**Defined fragment:**
- **Length**: 150-400 words (approximately ½ to 1 full page, double-spaced)
- **Content**: One claim with supporting evidence
- **Status**: Can range from rough freewriting to polished prose
- **Metadata**: Date, topic/tag, status code (draft/developing/polished)

**Rationale for this size:**
- **Small enough** to produce in 25-30 minutes of focused generative writing
- **Large enough** to contain complete thought (not just note or quote)
- **Flexible enough** to combine multiple fragments into larger piece OR extract from longer draft

**Why "one claim + evidence"?**

This structure teaches fundamental scholarly move: making assertions supported by evidence. Whether the fragment becomes part of a personal narrative, a source-based argument, or a reflective piece, this core structure applies.

### Accumulation Trajectory

**Target: 40-50 fragments by Week 12**

| Checkpoint | Cumulative Count | Production Rate | Character |
|-----------|------------------|-----------------|-----------|
| End M1 (Week 3) | 8-12 | 3-4/week | Exploratory, expansive |
| End M2 (Week 7) | 20-28 | 3-4/week | Source-engaged, structured |
| End M3 (Week 11) | 30-42 | 2-3/week | Consolidating, connecting |
| End M4 (Week 15) | 36-52 | ~1/week | Minimal new; focus on selection |

**Why this trajectory?**

- **Early acceleration**: M1-2 emphasize capture and expansion
- **Sustained middle**: M3 balances new generation with consolidation
- **Late deceleration**: M4 shifts from generation to curation

The total (40-50 fragments) represents:
- **6,000-20,000 words of raw material** (assuming 150-400 words/fragment)
- **Substantial selection challenge**: Portfolio ~3,000-4,000 words = choosing ~15% of corpus
- **Evidence of sustained practice**: 15 weeks × 3 fragments/week average

### Fragment vs. Traditional Essays

**What fragments are NOT:**
- Not rough drafts of essays (though essays may draw on multiple fragments)
- Not notes or quotes (they're generative prose)
- Not freewriting (though some start as freewriting then get structured)
- Not journal entries (they're claim-based, not purely reflective)

**What fragments ARE:**
- Modular units of thinking-in-writing
- Building blocks that can be combined, separated, reordered
- Evidence of daily writing practice
- Material from which portfolio pieces are selected and developed

---

## Audience Considerations

### Student Perspective

Students initially find fragment model **confusing** (they expect essay assignments) but ultimately **liberating** (daily writing is less intimidating than essay deadlines).

**Common student questions:**
- "How do I know when a fragment is 'done'?" → It's not about done-ness; it's about whether it's useful
- "Can I combine fragments later?" → Yes, that's the point; revision is recombination
- "What if I write too much?" → You can always fragment a longer piece; size is guideline not rule
- "What if I don't hit 40 fragments?" → Target, not requirement; better 35 strong fragments than 50 weak ones

**Support strategies:**
- **Visual tracking**: Students maintain fragment log (title, date, word count, status)
- **Folder organization**: Fragments sorted by Movement, making corpus visible
- **Status codes**: Draft/Developing/Polished helps students see work in progress
- **Exemplars**: Show how instructor's own fragments accumulate and combine

### Institutional Context

Fragment model aligns with WPA Outcomes:
- **Processes**: "Develop flexible strategies for drafting, reviewing, collaborating, revising, rewriting"—fragments enable multiple attempts at each
- **Knowledge of Conventions**: "Practice applying citation conventions"—happens across 40+ fragments, not just 3 essays
- **Critical Thinking**: "Identify and debate multiple positions"—fragments allow trying out positions without commitment

It also addresses common institutional concerns:
- **Labor-based grading**: Portfolio grade partly based on quantity (evidence of sustained work)
- **Academic integrity**: Harder to plagiarize 40 fragments than 3 essays; inconsistencies more visible
- **Transfer**: Distributed practice across many fragments promotes skill transfer better than episodic practice

## Alternative Approaches Considered

### Other Options

1. **Approach**: Traditional episodic model (3-4 major essays)
   **Rejected because**: Artificial closure; lost labor; transfer limitations; high-stakes deadlines create equity issues

2. **Approach**: Pure journaling/freewriting (no structure)
   **Rejected because**: Lacks claim+evidence structure; doesn't teach argumentation; hard to assess; risk of therapy/confession model

3. **Approach**: Large number of very small posts (like discussion board model)
   **Rejected because**: Too small to contain complete thought; encourages superficiality; assessment burden overwhelming

4. **Approach**: Zettelkasten/note-taking model (index cards only, never essays)
   **Rejected because**: Doesn't meet institutional expectations for polished writing; students need practice with sustained prose

5. **Approach**: Fewer, longer pieces (like NaNoWriMo approach)
   **Rejected because**: Doesn't provide practice at modular thinking; harder to revise through selection; less flexible

6. **Approach**: Fixed number (exactly 45 fragments required)
   **Rejected because**: Arbitrary precision; students game the system; privileges quantity over quality

## Connection to VIRENS Principles

Fragment model implements several VIRENS design principles:

| VIRENS Principle | Application in Fragments |
|-----------------|-------------------------|
| **C19: Value Accumulation** | Each fragment adds to corpus; value compounds over time |
| **B11: Capture-First Design** | Fragments enable low-friction capture with minimal structure |
| **B12: Multiple Discovery Paths** | Can find fragments by date, topic, status, Movement |
| **B15: Version Control** | Status codes track fragment development over time |
| **A04: Make Tacit Explicit** | Fragment count makes writing labor visible and countable |

The fragment model treats writing as **information architecture**: students aren't just "writing essays," they're **building and managing a corpus of reusable textual material**.

## Implementation Considerations

### In Weekly Planning

Each week specifies fragment production target:
- **M1**: 2-3 exploratory fragments/week
- **M2**: 3-4 source-engaged fragments/week
- **M3**: 2-3 consolidation fragments/week
- **M4**: ~1 fragment/week (new generation minimal)

### In Dev Logs

Students document fragment production:
> "This week I wrote 3 fragments: one on digital surveillance (sparked by Meadows [[@meadows2008lever]] reading), one processing my difficulty with Salvatori [[@salvatori1996conve]] (failure-as-diagnostic), and one connecting my literacy narrative to permission flags concept. Total corpus: 23 fragments."

### In Assessment

Fragment corpus contributes to grade:
- **Generative writing component** (100 pts): Based on sustained fragment production (not perfection)
- **Portfolio selection** (450 pts): Quality of selection from corpus (which fragments chosen, why)
- **Process documentation** (in dev logs): Evidence of fragments as working material

### In Portfolio Assembly (M4)

Students review entire corpus and select ~12-15 fragments to develop:
- Some remain as fragments (evidence of range)
- Some combine into longer pieces
- Some serve as raw material that gets extensively revised
- Portfolio includes "fragment map" showing what was selected and why

---

## Evidence & Iteration

### Evidence to Collect

- [ ] Fragment production rates: do students sustain 3-4/week?
- [ ] Fragment quality over time: are later fragments more sophisticated?
- [ ] Portfolio selection patterns: which fragments get developed? Which abandoned?
- [ ] Student reflections: do they value early fragments by semester end?
- [ ] Transfer: do students continue fragment practice in other courses?

### Revision Notes

**Potential adjustments based on implementation:**

- If fragment count becomes too high (students overwhelmed), reduce target to 30-35
- If fragments become too polished (students treating them like mini-essays), emphasize roughness is acceptable
- If students struggle to select from corpus, provide more structured selection activities mid-semester
- If certain fragment types more valuable than others, adjust weekly prompts to emphasize those types
- Consider fragment "retirement"—archiving early fragments that no longer serve
