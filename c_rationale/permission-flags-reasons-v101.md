## Design Philosophy

### Core Pedagogical Principle

The **permission flags model** makes explicit what is typically implicit in writing instruction: *who controls which constraints, when, and with what degree of flexibility*. Borrowed from Unix file system permissions (read, write, execute), this framework clarifies instructor decisions about constraint visibility, student agency, and gradual transfer of responsibility.

Traditional pedagogy often obscures these decisions: "Write an essay" implies all constraints are simultaneously active and instructor-controlled. The permission flags model instead reveals:
- Which constraints students can see (**visible**)
- Which they can examine and understand (**readable**)
- Which they can modify or customize (**writable**)
- Who decides when/how constraints apply (**ownership**)

This transparency serves two purposes: (1) reduces student confusion about "what's required when," and (2) creates explicit pathway for developing **student agency**—the capacity to make informed rhetorical choices rather than merely following prescriptions.

### Theoretical Grounding

**Key Sources:**
- Norman, Donald. *The Design of Everyday Things* (affordances, constraints, signifiers)
- Schön, Donald. *The Reflective Practitioner* (professional judgment, reflection-in-action)
- Vygotsky, Lev. *Mind in Society* (zone of proximal development, scaffolding)
- Downs, Doug, and Elizabeth Wardle. "Teaching about Writing, Righting Misconceptions" (writing-about-writing pedagogy)

**Concepts Applied:**
- **Affordances and constraints**: What actions does the environment enable/prohibit? (Norman)
- **Scaffolding**: Temporary supports that transfer responsibility gradually (Vygotsky)
- **Professional discretion**: Experts know when to follow/violate rules (Schön)
- **Metacognitive awareness**: Understanding *why* conventions exist enables strategic deployment (Downs & Wardle)

## Four Permission Flags

### Flag 1: Visible (V)

**Definition**: Constraint has been made explicit to students; they know it exists.

**Pedagogical Purpose**: Controls cognitive load by determining *when* students must track a requirement.

**Examples**:
- **V=0 (invisible)**: Citation formatting in Week 1-3 (students don't know it's coming)
- **V=1 (visible)**: Fragment length requirement from Week 1 ("150-400 words")

**Rationale**: Making constraints invisible early reduces simultaneous demands on attention. Students can focus on idea generation without tracking formatting rules. Visibility increases as capacity develops.

**Implementation**:
- Syllbus clearly states when constraints become visible
- Calendar marks "Constraint introduced: BEAM tagging (Week 5)"
- Dev log prompts ask students to identify newly visible constraints

**Theoretical Justification**: Cognitive load theory (Sweller): novices have limited working memory capacity. Reducing simultaneous demands improves learning.

---

### Flag 2: Readable (R)

**Definition**: Constraint's rationale and mechanism are transparent; students can examine *why* it exists and *how* it works.

**Pedagogical Purpose**: Supports metacognitive understanding rather than blind compliance.

**Examples**:
- **R=0 (opaque)**: "Use MLA format" (what is MLA? why this standard?)
- **R=1 (readable)**: "Use BEAM tags to categorize source use because..." (full explanation of categorization purpose)

**Rationale**: When students understand *why* constraints exist, they can:
1. Apply them more intelligently (not mechanically)
2. Adapt them to new contexts (transfer)
3. Violate them strategically when justified (professional judgment)

**Implementation**:
- Paired notes structure: every course constraint has "reasons" explanation
- Class activities that *show* constraint value before requiring compliance
- Examples of both successful constraint-following and strategic constraint-violation

**Theoretical Justification**: Downs & Wardle's writing-about-writing: students need to understand writing as an object of inquiry, not just a skill to perform. Understanding conventions' rationales enables critical deployment.

---

### Flag 3: Writable (W)

**Definition**: Constraint can be modified, customized, or adapted by students; not rigidly prescribed.

**Pedagogical Purpose**: Develops rhetorical agency—capacity to make informed choices about when/how to apply conventions.

**Examples**:
- **W=0 (fixed)**: Portfolio submission deadline (institutional requirement)
- **W=1 (writable)**: Fragment organization method (by topic? by source? by chronology? student decides)

**Rationale**: Premature prescription ("always outline before drafting") prevents students from developing judgment about *when* different strategies are appropriate. Writable constraints acknowledge context-dependency.

**Implementation**:
- Multiple acceptable approaches demonstrated
- Dev logs ask students to articulate *which* approach they chose and *why*
- Assessment values strategic choice-making, not universal compliance
- "Spec documents" formalize student-defined constraints for particular projects

**Theoretical Justification**: Schön's "reflection-in-action": professionals don't follow algorithms; they exercise judgment based on situation. Students need practice making these judgments in scaffolded contexts.

---

### Flag 4: Ownership (O)

**Definition**: Who controls when/whether constraint applies—instructor, student, peer group, disciplinary community, or negotiated?

**Pedagogical Purpose**: Makes power relations explicit; clarifies where student agency exists vs. where external authorities constrain choice.

**Examples**:
- **O=instructor**: Assignment deadlines
- **O=student**: Which fragments to include in final portfolio
- **O=peer**: Peer review criteria (negotiated within review group)
- **O=discipline**: Citation format for specific journals
- **O=negotiated**: Devlog frequency (instructor sets range, student chooses within it)

**Rationale**: Students often don't know *who decides* what's required. Making ownership explicit:
1. Reduces anxiety ("Is this my choice or a requirement?")
2. Prepares for disciplinary writing (understanding how/why communities establish conventions)
3. Creates space for legitimate customization

**Implementation**:
- Syllabus indicates ownership for each requirement
- Activities exploring *why* disciplinary communities establish particular conventions
- Opportunities to negotiate constraints (e.g., propose alternative devlog format)
- Portfolio reflection asks students to distinguish instructor requirements from student choices

**Theoretical Justification**: Genre theory (Miller, Devitt): genres are social actions shaped by community expectations. Students need to understand convention-as-choice-made-by-community rather than convention-as-universal-law.

## Permission Flags Across the Semester

### Week 1-3 (M1: Surfacing)

| Constraint | V | R | W | O | Notes |
|------------|---|---|---|---|-------|
| Write 3-4 fragments/week | 1 | 1 | 0 | Instructor | Non-negotiable accumulation |
| 150-400 words/fragment | 1 | 1 | △ | Negotiated | Range allows flexibility |
| One claim + evidence | 1 | 1 | 0 | Instructor | Defines fragment atomicity |
| Organization | 0 | 0 | 0 | — | Not yet introduced |
| Citation formatting | 0 | 0 | 0 | — | Not yet introduced |
| Grammar/mechanics | 0 | 0 | 1 | Student | Students may polish if desired, not required |

**Pedagogical Logic**: Minimal visible constraints; high writability where constraints exist; student ownership over surface features.

### Week 4-7 (M2: Naming)

| Constraint | V | R | W | O | Notes |
|------------|---|---|---|---|-------|
| BEAM tagging | 1 | 1 | △ | Negotiated | Categories defined, application flexible |
| Source integration (SEAR) | 1 | 1 | 1 | Student | Method introduced, customizable |
| Peer review participation | 1 | 1 | 0 | Shared | Must participate, criteria negotiable |
| Citation format | 1 | △ | 0 | Zotero | Visible (use citations), readable (why), Zotero handles formatting |
| Organization within fragment | 1 | 1 | 1 | Student | Structures suggested, not prescribed |

**Pedagogical Logic**: More constraints visible; readability increases; writability expands as students develop judgment.

### Week 8-11 (M3: Operating at Scale)

| Constraint | V | R | W | O | Notes |
|------------|---|---|---|---|-------|
| Corpus organization | 1 | 1 | 1 | Student | Methods demonstrated, choice is student's |
| Cross-fragment coherence | 1 | 1 | 1 | Student | How to achieve it is student choice |
| Dev log detail | 1 | 1 | △ | Negotiated | Frequency set, depth variable |
| Documented inquiry | 1 | 1 | 1 | Student | Genre introduced flexibly |

**Pedagogical Logic**: High writability; student ownership expands; instructor ownership reduces to deadlines and participation.

### Week 12-15 (M4: Synthesis)

| Constraint | V | R | W | O | Notes |
|------------|---|---|---|---|-------|
| Portfolio selection | 1 | 1 | 1 | Student | Full agency over what to include |
| Portfolio coherence | 1 | 1 | △ | Negotiated | Must be coherent, how = student choice |
| Introduction genre | 1 | 1 | 1 | Student | Examples shown, creative approaches welcome |
| Final polish | 1 | 1 | 1 | Student | Which pieces to polish, how much = student choice |
| Submission format | 1 | 1 | 0 | Institutional | Fixed by university LMS |

**Pedagogical Logic**: Maximum student agency within institutional constraints; all constraints visible and readable; high writability.

## Progressive Transfer of Agency

The permission flags model creates a **visible pathway** from instructor-directed to student-directed work:

**Early semester**: 
- V=1 (students see what's required)
- R=1 (students understand why)
- W=0 (limited customization)
- O=instructor (instructor controls)

**Mid-semester**:
- V=1 (all relevant constraints visible)
- R=1 (full transparency maintained)
- W=△ (increasing flexibility)
- O=negotiated (shared control)

**Late semester**:
- V=1 (nothing hidden)
- R=1 (complete transparency)
- W=1 (high customization)
- O=student (student controls most choices)

**Endpoint**: Students equipped to make informed rhetorical choices in new contexts because they've practiced exercising judgment in scaffolded environment.

## Comparison to Implicit Constraint Models

### Traditional "Hidden Curriculum"

In many composition courses, permission flags are **never made explicit**:
- Students don't know which constraints are negotiable
- Instructor preferences conflated with universal requirements
- Agency develops accidentally (or doesn't)
- Transfer fails because students don't know *which* aspects of writing are context-dependent

### Permission Flags Model Benefits

**For Students**:
- Reduced anxiety ("I know what's required when")
- Clear pathway to agency ("I can see myself gaining control")
- Transferable understanding ("I can identify constraints in new contexts")
- Metacognitive awareness ("I understand why conventions exist")

**For Instructors**:
- Explicit pedagogical decisions (forces clarity about what's required vs. suggested)
- Consistent communication (syllabus, rubrics, feedback all align with flags)
- Evidence-based revision (flag settings can be adjusted based on student performance)
- Transparent assessment (students know what's being evaluated)

## Implementation Challenges

### Challenge 1: Complexity

**Issue**: Four flags × multiple constraints = potentially overwhelming matrix.

**Mitigation**:
- Introduce model gradually (Week 1: just V flag; Week 4: add R flag; etc.)
- Focus on *examples* ("This is writable; that's not") rather than abstract categories
- Use consistent language ("This is negotiable" = W=1)

### Challenge 2: Student Expectations

**Issue**: Students accustomed to "just tell me what to do" may resist open constraints.

**Mitigation**:
- Frame high writability as **opportunity**, not ambiguity
- Provide examples of successful customization
- Dev logs scaffold decision-making process
- Peer review shows multiple valid approaches

### Challenge 3: Assessment Alignment

**Issue**: Rubrics must reflect flag settings or model fails.

**Mitigation**:
- Rubric categories align with visible constraints only
- "Choice-making" becomes assessable criterion when W=1
- Process documentation captures *how* students exercised agency
- Portfolio reflection articulates understanding of constraint flexibility

## Evidence to Collect

### Evidence This Is Working

- [ ] Students accurately identify which constraints are negotiable
- [ ] Dev logs show metacognitive awareness of constraint choices
- [ ] Students customize writable constraints in rhetorically justified ways
- [ ] Portfolio reflections demonstrate understanding of permission model

### Revision Notes

<!-- After pilot: What worked, what needs adjustment -->

[PLACEHOLDER: Post-pilot analysis]

- Monitor: Which constraints should shift flag settings? (Too rigid? Too open?)
- Assess: Do students experience writability as productive flexibility or confusing ambiguity?
- Adjust: Does the four-flag model need simplification? (Three flags? Two?)
