## Design Philosophy

### Core Pedagogical Principle

The Four Constellations provide the conceptual scaffolding for VIRENS 101, organizing seemingly disparate writing practices (index cards, citation management, process documentation, peer review) into a coherent intellectual framework. Rather than presenting these as isolated "skills," the constellations reveal them as manifestations of deeper structural principles that operate across writing, design, and systems thinking.

This approach addresses a fundamental pedagogical challenge: first-year students often experience composition instruction as a disconnected series of requirements (formats, citation styles, revision strategies) without understanding the *why* behind these practices. The constellations make visible the implicit curriculum—the unstated assumptions about how knowledge is structured, how meaning is transported, and how systems shape what can be said.

### Theoretical Grounding

**Key Sources:**
- Alexander, Christopher. *Notes on the Synthesis of Form* (constraint decomposition, misfits)
- Star, Susan Leigh & Bowker, Geoffrey. "Invisible Infrastructure" (infrastructure invisibility)
- Meadows, Donella. "Leverage Points: Places to Intervene in a System" (systems intervention)
- Ong, Walter. "Writing Restructures Consciousness" (technology of word)
- Kline, Ronald. "What Is Technology?" (technology as artifact/know-how/system)

**Concepts Applied:**
- **Infrastructure studies**: Making visible what typically remains invisible (Star & Bowker)
- **Design decomposition**: Breaking complex problems into tractable subproblems (Alexander)
- **Systems thinking**: Understanding how structure influences behavior (Meadows)
- **Media ecology**: How technologies reshape cognitive operations (Ong)
- **Technological literacy**: Technology as system, not just artifact (Kline)

## The Four Constellations

### Constellation 1: Graph as Ur-Structure

**Core Insight**: All knowledge representation involves choices about connection and hierarchy. Graphs (networks of nodes and edges) are the fundamental structure; hierarchies and sequences are special cases.

**Why This Matters for Writing**:
- Traditional outlines impose premature hierarchy
- Fragment-based writing allows connections to emerge
- Citations are edges (links) between knowledge nodes
- "Related work" sections are local graph neighborhoods
- Bibliographies are adjacency lists

**Pedagogical Application**:
- Students build corpus non-hierarchically (accumulation without forced organization)
- Index cards as nodes; physical proximity and explicit cross-references as edges
- BEAM tagging and citation work reveal how texts link to each other
- Portfolio assembly involves graph traversal (selecting connected subgraph)

**Connection to Composition Theory**: 
Challenges current-traditional rhetoric's emphasis on outlining as primary invention strategy. Aligns with post-process recursiveness (Murray, Perl) and hypertext theory (Landow, Bolter).

### Constellation 2: Levels of Abstraction as Navigable Terrain

**Core Insight**: Writing operates simultaneously at multiple levels (characters, words, sentences, paragraphs, documents, corpora). Skilled writers navigate fluidly between these levels; novices get stuck at one level.

**Why This Matters for Writing**:
- Sentence-level editing while drafting = wrong level of abstraction
- Revision requires zooming out (document level) then back in (sentence level)
- Organization problems can't be solved at paragraph level—need document level
- Portfolio requires corpus-level thinking (which pieces form coherent collection?)

**Pedagogical Application**:
- Constraint sequencing: Which constraints apply at which level? When?
- Dev logs capture movement between levels ("I was working on sentences but realized the problem was organizational")
- Movement structure: M1 = fragment level, M2 = fragment + source level, M3 = corpus level, M4 = portfolio level
- Permission flags model visibility of constraints at different scales

**Connection to Systems Theory**:
Brooks's "essential vs. accidental complexity": Some problems are inherently multi-level. Schön's "reflection-in-action": Practitioners move between levels during work.

**Implementation**: [[four-constellations-course-v101#abstraction-activities|Abstraction navigation activities]]

---

### Constellation 3: Automation as Meaning-Transport Infrastructure

**Core Insight**: Writing is labor-intensive because meaning doesn't transport automatically. Every citation, every cross-reference, every revised paragraph represents manual meaning-transport. Automation amplifies human intention but doesn't replace it.

**Why This Matters for Writing**:
- Citation managers automate format, not interpretation
- Templates automate structure, not thinking
- Peer review systems route feedback, don't generate insight
- Version control tracks changes, doesn't decide what to change

**Pedagogical Application**:
- Tools (Zotero, Eli Review, folder structure) are infrastructure for transporting meaning
- Students document *why* they make choices, not just *what* they produce
- Automation reveals what's mechanical (formatting) vs. what requires judgment (analysis)
- Failed automation = diagnostic signal about task complexity

**Connection to Writing Studies**:
Selber's "multiliteracies": functional (using tools), critical (understanding how tools shape work), rhetorical (deploying tools strategically). Students need all three.

**Implementation**: [[four-constellations-course-v101#automation-activities|Infrastructure activities]]

---

### Constellation 4: Invisible Systems That Speak For You

**Core Insight**: Writing creates permanent representations that circulate independently of author. These representations "speak for you" in your absence. Understanding what systems make visible/invisible is rhetorical knowledge.

**Why This Matters for Writing**:
- Portfolio is system that speaks for you to future instructors/employers
- Process documentation makes invisible labor visible
- Citation practices reveal how you position yourself in scholarly conversation
- Genre conventions are invisible systems until you violate them

**Pedagogical Application**:
- Portfolio isn't "best work" but "strategic representation"
- READMEs and dev logs make processes visible that would otherwise be invisible
- Peer review makes audience expectations visible
- Constraint experiments reveal usually-invisible genre rules

**Connection to Infrastructure Studies**:
Star & Bowker: Infrastructure becomes visible upon breakdown. Ribes & Jackson: Documentation reveals what systems preserve vs. what they discard.

**Implementation**: [[four-constellations-course-v101#invisible-systems-activities|Visibility activities]]

## Integration Strategy

### How Constellations Work Together

The four constellations are **not** sequential (unlike the Four Movements). They're **concurrent perspectives** on the same writing practices:

| Practice | Graph Lens | Abstraction Lens | Automation Lens | Visibility Lens |
|----------|-----------|------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Fragment writing | Building nodes | Working at fragment level | Manual capture, no auto-generation | Making thinking visible |
| Citation work | Creating edges | Connecting document to corpus | Zotero automates format, not interpretation | Positioning self in conversation |
| Process docs | Linking activities over time | Reflecting across levels | Manual documentation of automated tools | Making labor visible |
| Portfolio assembly | Selecting subgraph | Corpus-level curation | Manual selection from automated collection | Strategic self-representation |

### Pedagogical Sequencing

**Week 1-3 (M1)**: Introduce constellations implicitly through activities
**Week 4-5 (M2)**: Name constellations explicitly; students begin recognizing patterns
**Week 8-9 (M3)**: Students use constellation vocabulary in dev logs
**Week 14-15 (M4)**: Students articulate which constellation thinking shaped their portfolio

**Rationale**: Constellations are *post hoc* frameworks. Students experience them first, name them second, deploy them strategically third. This follows Salvatori's "difficulty pedagogy"—work first, theorize second.

## Anticipated Challenges

### Challenge 1: Abstraction Overload

**Issue**: Four conceptual frameworks + composition content = high cognitive load

**Mitigation**: 
- Introduce through concrete activities, not abstract lecture
- Use consistent vocabulary but don't require students to master all four simultaneously
- Dev logs capture *which* constellation was useful when, building metacognitive awareness gradually

### Challenge 2: Tech Resistance

**Issue**: "Why all these tools?" feels like learning Zotero instead of learning writing

**Mitigation**:
- Constellations show *why* tools matter (infrastructure, automation, visibility)
- Activities demonstrate tools in service of thinking, not as ends in themselves
- Tech budget = 6 blocks total; most time spent writing, not configuring

### Challenge 3: Theory vs. Practice Gap

**Issue**: Students may see constellations as detached from "real writing"

**Mitigation**:
- Every constellation links to specific assignments and activities
- Examples drawn from their own writing practices
- Assessment values application (dev logs showing constellation thinking) not recitation
