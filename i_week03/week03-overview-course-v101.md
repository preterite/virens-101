## Synthesis

Two weeks in, you've been writing. Fragments scattered across your folder, the envelope sealed and waiting, scraps of ideas you weren't sure what to do with. This week asks you to slow down and notice something about that process—not just *what* you've written, but *how* you've been reading and thinking along the way.

Mariolina Salvatori's "Conversations with Texts" offers a counterintuitive idea: difficulty is not a sign of failure. When you hit something hard in a text—a passage that confuses you, an argument that resists your first reading, a moment where you're not sure what the writer is doing—that difficulty is *information*. It's telling you something about the text's structure, about your expectations, about the gap between what you assumed and what you're encountering. Salvatori asks students to write "difficulty papers"—not to confess inadequacy, but to investigate what the difficulty reveals. "What they perceive as 'difficult,'" she writes, "is a feature of the text demanding to be critically engaged rather than ignored" (448). The difficulty becomes a doorway, not a wall.

But Salvatori's argument goes further. She indicts as "objectionable" any approach to reading that makes it possible "to cover over the processes by which knowledge and understanding are produced" (444). What's valuable, she argues, is the opposite: learning "to recapture and learn from the complex processes that have given a written text its particular shape." This is why difficulty matters—it's where process becomes visible. When reading is easy, you don't notice how you're doing it. When reading is hard, you're forced to see your own thinking at work. The same is true for writing. When a sentence comes easily, you might not notice the choices you made. When you struggle, the choices become apparent.

This matters because reading and writing are acts of responsibility. Salvatori proposes that "a reader must accept and carry out the tremendous responsibility of giving a voice, and therefore a sort of life, to the text's argument," and that the corollary is "the writer's responsibility, the responsibility of writing a text that asks (rather than answers) questions, that proposes (rather than imposes) arguments, and that therefore makes a conversation possible" (441). Reading isn't extraction—pulling meaning out of a text like ore from a mine. It's giving voice to something that can't speak without you. And writing isn't depositing information for later retrieval. It's opening a conversation that continues across time, possibly with readers you'll never meet.

Think back to the envelope exercise in Week 1. One of the questions asked what worries you about this course. That was a difficulty prompt—we just didn't call it that yet. Salvatori gives us vocabulary for what that question was doing: surfacing the places where your expectations and the situation don't yet fit. The worry wasn't a problem to eliminate. It was information about where your thinking needed to go.

The compression exercise this week works on a similar principle. You'll take a 300-word passage and cut it to 200, then to 100. The constraint forces distillation: what stays, what goes, what matters enough to survive when space runs out. Every cut is a decision, and the decisions reveal your priorities. You might not be able to articulate *why* you kept one sentence and cut another—but the pattern of your choices shows what you think is essential. That's the metacognitive interruption Salvatori describes: "making what is imperceptible—thinking—at least dimly perceptible." You can't see your own thinking directly. But you can see its traces in what you choose to keep.

This connects to something Ong told us last week: writing restructures consciousness. Salvatori extends the claim. Reading restructures too, through what she calls the "hermeneutical conversation" with a text. The reader and the text are partners, not opponents. Neither wins. Both change. When you revise your early fragments this week, you're not fixing mistakes—you're continuing a conversation with your earlier self. The words you wrote last week were one version of your thinking. The revision is another. The Literacy Narrative you're drafting by week's end will be another still.

It's okay for this material to be challenging. You're not here because you know it already. Seeing that it's hard gives us direction. Direction can yield access.

One more note: this week you'll start keeping a development log—brief, regular notes on what you did, what happened, what you learned. The dev log is process documentation: making visible the work that usually stays invisible. It's Salvatori's principle applied to your own practice. The log won't be polished writing. It's a trace of your thinking, something you can return to later when you're trying to understand how your work took shape.

We'll return to Salvatori's framework explicitly in Week 10, when we pair her ideas with a very different reading—Susan Leigh Star's work on infrastructure. The connection: both are about making invisible things visible. Salvatori asks you to see the processes that produce understanding. Star asks you to see the systems that structure everyday life. This is Difficulty Pair A, and it's deliberate. The reading you're doing now sets up a return seven weeks from now. Notice what's hard. We'll use it.

## Reading

**This Week**: 

- [[reading-salvatori-conversations-texts-course-v101|Salvatori, "Conversations with Texts: Reading in the Teaching of Composition"]] (~15-20 pages)

**Key Concepts**:
- Difficulty-as-diagnostic: difficulty as information, not failure
- Metacognitive interruption: making thinking visible
- Hermeneutical conversation: reading as dialogue, not extraction
- Reader/writer responsibility: giving voice, opening conversation
- Process visibility: recapturing how understanding is produced

**Connection to Activities**: The compression exercise enacts Salvatori's metacognitive interruption—cuts reveal priorities. Envelope revision continues the conversation with earlier thinking. Dev log applies process visibility to students' own practice.

**Difficulty Pair A**: This reading begins a deliberate pairing with Star's infrastructure work in Week 10. Theme: making invisible things visible. Salvatori → processes of understanding; Star → systems of everyday life.

**Difficulty Notes**: Salvatori writes in an academic register that may feel dense. The core ideas are accessible, but the prose requires patience. This is intentional—students practice difficulty-as-diagnostic on the reading itself.

## Block-by-Block Schedule

| Block | Type | Activity | Notes |
|-------|------|----------|-------|
| 1 | W | Fragment development toward Literacy Narrative | Continuing M1 accumulation |
| 2 | R | Self-revision of early fragments | Ong-informed revision |
| 3 | W | Compression exercise (300→200→100) | Constraint forces distillation |
| 4 | P | Peer feedback on compression (informal) | In-class, low-stakes |
| 5 | R | Revision based on peer feedback | Prompt 3.5 available |
| 6 | W | Literacy Narrative draft completion | Preparing for Week 4 submission |

### Block Details

#### Block 1: Fragment Development toward Literacy Narrative

**Type**: W

**Duration**: 25 minutes

**Materials**: Student folders (OneDrive), fragment drafts, Literacy Narrative assignment sheet

**Opening** (3 min): "You have fragments from Weeks 1 and 2. Some of them might connect to your Literacy Narrative; some might not. Today's work is development—pushing fragments further, seeing what wants to grow."

**Main Activity** (19 min): Students work on fragments with Literacy Narrative in mind. Options:
- Develop an existing fragment that connects to literacy/technology themes
- Start a new fragment responding to Salvatori's difficulty concept
- Freewrite toward the Literacy Narrative if ready to draft

Circulate to check fragment accumulation (target: 5-8 by now).

**Closing** (3 min): Quick check-in: "How many fragments do you have? Which ones feel alive?" Transition to envelope revision.

**Connection**: Continues [[outcome-5-textual-accumulation]]; prepares for [[literacy-narrative-assignment-course-v101]]

---

#### Block 2: Self-Revision of Early Fragments

**Type**: R

**Duration**: 25 minutes

**Materials**: Student folders (OneDrive), early fragments from Weeks 1-2, Ong reading notes

**Opening** (5 min): "Last week, Ong argued that writing restructures consciousness. Today you'll test that claim on your own work. Return to a fragment you wrote in Week 1 or 2—read it as if someone else wrote it. What do you notice? What would you change?"

Introduce the revision questions from Prompt 3.5:
- Where does this need more specificity to be recognizably *yours*?
- What will others not recognize or understand the implications of?
- What does it ignore or shut down?
- What productive questions does it raise but not pursue?

**Main Activity** (17 min): Students select an early fragment (Block 1.2 technological literacy recommended) and revise it using the Ong lens:
- How did the technology change not just what you could do but how you think?
- Where did the system become "interior to consciousness"?
- What's missing that would make this more than a generic account?

Students revise directly—not commenting on the fragment, but rewriting it.

**Closing** (3 min): Brief sharing (optional): "One thing you noticed about your own writing that surprised you."

**Connection**: Enacts Ong's "writing restructures consciousness"; supports [[outcome-1-composing-processes]]; prepares for Prompt 3.5 full version in Block 5

---

#### Block 3: Compression Exercise

**Type**: W

**Duration**: 25 minutes

**Materials**: Compression exercise handout, student draft material (fragment or envelope revision)

**Opening** (3 min): Frame the exercise: "Compression forces choices. You'll take 300 words and cut to 200, then to 100. The constraint isn't punishment—it's a lens. What survives tells you what you think matters."

**Main Activity** (19 min): 
1. **Select source** (2 min): Students choose a 300-word passage from their own writing (early fragment or Literacy Narrative draft)
2. **First compression** (7 min): Cut to 200 words. What goes? What stays?
3. **Second compression** (7 min): Cut to 100 words. Now what's essential?
4. **Reflection** (3 min): Note what you cut and why. What pattern do you see in your choices?

**Closing** (3 min): "You now have three versions: 300, 200, 100. The differences reveal your priorities. That's metacognitive interruption—your thinking made visible through your choices."

**Connection**: Enacts Salvatori's metacognitive interruption; develops [[outcome-4-constraint-literacy]]; models distillation (six-move: distill)

---

#### Block 4: Peer Feedback on Compression

**Type**: P (informal)

**Duration**: 25 minutes

**Materials**: Students' compression exercises (all three versions)

**Opening** (3 min): "Share your three versions with a partner. The question isn't 'which is best'—it's 'what do the cuts reveal?' Help each other see what the compression made visible."

**Main Activity** (18 min): 
- Partners exchange compression exercises
- Each partner reads all three versions (300, 200, 100)
- Discussion prompts:
  - What survived all the way to 100? Why do you think that stayed?
  - What got cut between 300 and 200 that you were surprised to see go?
  - What does the 100-word version prioritize that the 300-word version didn't?
- Switch roles and repeat

**Closing** (4 min): Whole-class debrief: "What did compression reveal about your thinking that you didn't expect?"

**Connection**: Informal peer review builds toward [[peer-review-cycle1-literacy-narrative-criteria-course-v101]] in Week 5; practices metacognitive vocabulary

---

#### Block 5: Revision Based on Peer Feedback

**Type**: R

**Duration**: 25 minutes

**Materials**: Compression feedback, Prompt 3.5 handout (optional), student drafts

**Opening** (3 min): "You've seen what compression reveals. Now use that insight. Revision isn't about making things 'better' in the abstract—it's about making choices that serve your purpose." Introduce Prompt 3.5 ("Ong Revision") as optional alternative.

**Main Activity** (19 min): Students choose their revision focus:
- **Option A**: Expand the 100-word compression back out, but differently—use what you learned about priorities
- **Option B**: Apply compression insights to Literacy Narrative draft
- **Option C**: Prompt 3.5—revise a fragment using Ong's "writing restructures consciousness" as lens

Circulate to support revision choices.

**Closing** (3 min): Checkpoint: "Where are you with your Literacy Narrative? What do you need to finish a draft by end of this week?"

**Connection**: [[outcome-1-composing-processes]]; prepares for Literacy Narrative completion in Block 6

---

#### Block 6: Literacy Narrative Draft Completion

**Type**: W

**Duration**: 25 minutes

**Materials**: Literacy Narrative assignment sheet, student drafts, dev log template

**Opening** (5 min): Two tasks today:
1. Push your Literacy Narrative draft as far as you can
2. Start your development log

Introduce dev log: "Brief notes on what you did, what happened, what you learned. Not polished writing—a trace of your process. This is Salvatori's principle applied to your own work: making the invisible visible."

**Main Activity** (17 min): 
- Primary: Literacy Narrative drafting (due end of Week 4)
- Secondary: First dev log entry (capture today's work)

Students may draft continuously or alternate between narrative and log.

**Closing** (3 min): Reminder: "Literacy Narrative draft is due at the end of Week 4 for Eli Review Cycle 1. Next week we shift to source-based writing—Movement 2 begins. Bring your questions about sources and citation."

**Connection**: [[literacy-narrative-assignment-course-v101]]; [[outcome-7-process-documentation]]; transitions toward M2

## Instructor Notes

### Facilitation Tips

- **Salvatori's register**: The reading is dense. Students may struggle—and that's the point. Frame it explicitly: "If this feels hard, you're practicing what Salvatori describes. Notice the difficulty. What does it reveal?"

- **Envelope revision emotional weight**: Students may feel vulnerable reading their Week 1 worries. Create a supportive tone. The goal isn't judgment—it's noticing change.

- **Compression resistance**: Some students resist cutting their own words. Reframe: "You're not killing darlings—you're discovering what you actually think is essential."

- **Dev log launch**: Keep it low-stakes. Model a quick entry: "Today I compressed a fragment from 300 to 100 words. The hardest cut was [X]. I learned that I default to [Y]." That's it.

- **Difficulty Pair A setup**: Name the pairing explicitly in class. Students should know this reading returns in Week 10. Write it on the board: "Salvatori (Week 3) ↔ Star (Week 10) = Difficulty Pair A: Making invisible things visible."

### Flexibility Points

- **Block 1 vs. Block 6**: Both are writing blocks focused on Literacy Narrative. If students need more revision time (Blocks 2, 5), compress Block 1 or 6.

- **Compression source**: Students can compress any substantial writing—early fragment or Literacy Narrative draft. Flexibility serves different student needs.

- **Prompt 3.5 timing**: Listed for Block 5 but can be used anytime. Some students may prefer it for Block 1 or 6.

### What's Locked

- **Compression exercise**: Blocks 3-4 are the week's pedagogical centerpiece—enacts Salvatori's metacognitive interruption.
- **Early fragment revision**: Block 2 enacts Ong's claim through return to own writing—connects to Prompt 3.5.
- **Dev log start**: Must begin this week per schedule.
- **Salvatori reading**: Anchors Difficulty Pair A—cannot shift.

### Evidence to Collect

- Fragment count: Are students reaching 8-12 by week's end?
- Compression patterns: What do students consistently cut? What do they keep?
- Early fragment revision insights: What do students notice when returning to their own writing? (Data for Ong application)
- Dev log adoption: Are students actually using the format? What's working?
- Salvatori difficulty: Where do students report struggling with the reading? (Data for Week 10 return)
