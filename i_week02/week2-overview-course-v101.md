## This Week's Place in the Course

Week 2 shifts from pure generation (Week 1's freewriting and envelope exercise) to system-building. Students learn the tools that will hold their accumulating work: index cards for fast capture, OneDrive folders for persistent storage, Eli Review for peer sharing. The reading—Ong's "Writing Restructures Consciousness"—provides theoretical grounding: writing is a technology that shapes thought, not just a transparent medium for recording it.

This week introduces **graph thinking** as a named concept, setting up its return in Week 10 with Bush's "As We May Think" and associative trails. The emphasis on **future self as audience** reframes setup work as purposeful infrastructure rather than arbitrary organization.

**Key introductions**: Graph thinking (ONESIE), freewriting mechanics, textual accumulation deepening, capture as first move.

## Synthesis

Last week you wrote—fragments, freewriting, the envelope exercise. This week you start building the system that will hold what you write. The tools are simple: index cards, folders, a peer review platform. The purpose behind them matters more than the mechanics.

Walter Ong offers a useful provocation: "By contrast with natural, oral speech, writing is completely artificial. There is no way to write 'naturally'." This might seem strange—doesn't writing feel natural when it's going well? But Ong's point is that writing requires tools, surfaces, systems. Speech emerges from bodies in shared space; writing requires mediation. You need something to write with, something to write on, somewhere to put what you've written. Ong continues: "Technologies are not mere exterior aids but also interior transformations of consciousness, and never more than when they affect the word." The tools you use shape how you think. A blank page invites different thinking than a structured template. Index cards spread across a table afford different connections than a linear document scrolling down a screen. Writing is a technology, and like other technologies, it substitutes capital for labor—but first, labor must create the capital. The fragments you write become material you can draw on later, reducing the labor of starting from scratch. The system you build this week provides infrastructure for accumulating intellectual capital.

This is what we mean by **textual accumulation**: the deliberate building of a corpus over time. Your fragments, notes, and freewriting accumulate into a growing collection. Some will become parts of larger projects. Others will connect to fragments you haven't written yet. Some will sit unused—and that's fine. The point is abundance. The more material you accumulate, the more options you have when it's time to assemble.

How do you generate that material? **Freewriting** is a technique for producing text without the constraints that usually slow us down. Set a timer (three or five minutes), put pen to paper or fingers to keyboard, and keep moving until the timer ends. Don't stop to fix spelling. Don't pause to find the right word. Don't reread what you've written. Just keep your hand moving.

What happens when you can't think of anything? You write that. "I can't think of what to write. My mind is blank. I'm just sitting here writing about not writing." The physical act of keeping your hand moving dislodges stuck mental processes. The muscle movement pulls thoughts forward. Almost always, if you keep writing "I can't think of anything" for thirty seconds, something emerges. A memory surfaces. A question forms. The stuck feeling breaks.

Peter Elbow, who popularized freewriting, argues that one of its powers comes from temporarily ignoring audience. When you write with readers in mind—worrying about how you'll sound, whether they'll judge you—those concerns become constraints. Useful constraints, eventually. But constraints that can paralyze you when you're trying to generate material. Freewriting removes the audience. No one will read this. It doesn't have to be good.

Ong shows us that writing is always mediated by technology—never "natural," always shaped by tools. Elbow shows us that we can strategically remove some of those mediations to generate more freely. The two insights work together: writing is artificial, and we can manipulate its artificiality. Remove constraints to generate; add constraints to refine. This is the principle we call [[yolo-up-constrain-down-course-v101|YOLO up, constrain down]]: expand your options first, then let constraints do their sorting work.

Some practical strategies for generative writing:

- **Timed sprints**: Three or five minutes, no stopping. The timer creates productive pressure—you don't have time to judge, only to produce.
- **Keep the hand moving**: When stuck, write "I'm stuck" and keep going. The movement itself generates thought.
- **Lower the stakes**: This is not a draft. You're producing raw material. Quantity over quality.
- **Capture before judging**: Get the idea down first; decide if it's good later. A captured bad idea costs nothing. An uncaptured good idea is lost.
- **Trust accumulation**: Not every fragment needs to be useful. You're building abundance.

Accumulation enables **graph thinking**. In a list, items sit in sequence: first this, then that. In a graph, items connect in multiple directions: this idea links to that one, which links to three others, one of which circles back to the first. You can't see these connections with only a few fragments. You need multitudes. For multitudes, setup matters. You're building infrastructure for your future self—the version of you in Week 8 or Week 12 who needs to find that fragment, who won't remember when you wrote it or what you called it. Folders you create and files you name are decisions about what future-you will find. Future-you is your most important audience this week.

Names matter. A file called "fragment1.docx" tells future-you nothing. A file called "2026-01-21_five-paragraph-template-memory.docx" tells future-you when, what, and roughly why. Consistency matters more than complexity. But the names you choose now determine whether connections become visible later.

The tech blocks this week introduce your capture and storage tools. Index cards are for fast capture—getting ideas down before they disappear. They're cheap, tactile, disposable. Bad idea? Toss the card. OneDrive folders are for storage—where fragments go once they've proven worth keeping. Eli Review is for sharing—where your writing becomes visible to readers beyond yourself. Each tool has a job; together they form a workflow.

You're not learning software for its own sake. You're building a system that will hold a semester's worth of thinking—fragments accumulating into a corpus, connections emerging over time, labor becoming capital you can draw on. What you build now shapes what becomes possible later.

## Reading

### Primary Text

**Walter Ong, "Writing Restructures Consciousness"** (~25 pages)

From _Orality and Literacy_, this chapter argues that writing is not merely a way to record speech but a technology that fundamentally transforms how humans think. Ong traces how writing creates "autonomous discourse"—text that operates independently of its author—and how this separation enables new forms of thought impossible in purely oral cultures.

**Reading focus**: Pay attention to Ong's claim that writing is "artificial." What does he mean? Why does he say this is praise, not criticism? How does writing change consciousness rather than just recording it?

### Secondary Text

**README Examples** (~5-10 pages)

Three examples of README files from software projects. READMEs are documentation that explains what a project is, why it exists, and how to use it. They're models for making systems understandable to others—including your future self.

**Reading focus**: How do these documents orient readers? What do they assume readers already know? What would a "README" for your writing system look like?

See: [[readme-examples-composite-course-v101]]

### Connecting to Course Concepts

| Ong's Argument | Course Application |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Writing is artificial, requires tools | Your system (cards, folders, platforms) shapes your thinking |
| Technologies transform consciousness | The tools you choose affect what you can do |
| Writing creates autonomous discourse | Your fragments will outlive the moment you wrote them |
| Writing enables new cognitive operations | Accumulation and connection become possible |

## ONESIES: New Concept Introduction

### Graph Thinking

**Definition**: Understanding ideas as nodes in a network rather than items in a list. In a list, items have sequence (first, second, third). In a graph, items have connections—multiple links running in multiple directions.

**Example**: Imagine you capture a fragment about how your high school taught the five-paragraph essay. Later, you capture a fragment about a podcast discussing how AI generates text. These seem unrelated—until you notice both involve templates, formulas, structures that promise to make writing easier. In a list, they're separate items. In a graph, they're connected nodes, and the connection itself becomes interesting.

**Why it matters**: Your fragments aren't isolated. The idea you capture today might connect to something from last week and something you won't write until November. But you can only see these connections if you have enough material to connect. Graph thinking requires multitudes.

**Application**: When you name files and organize folders, you're making decisions about future findability. A fragment about "templates" might connect to fragments about "formulas," "AI," "high school writing," "constraints." Graph thinking asks: how will I find this later? What might it connect to?

**Returns in**: Week 10 (Bush's "As We May Think," associative trails, the memex vision)

---

### Freewriting (Technique)

**Definition**: Timed, continuous writing without stopping to edit, correct, or reconsider. The goal is generation, not quality.

**Mechanics**:
1. Set a timer (3-5 minutes)
2. Start writing and don't stop until the timer ends
3. If stuck, write "I'm stuck" and keep going
4. Don't reread, don't fix errors, don't pause

**Why it works**: The physical act of keeping your hand moving dislodges mental blocks. Muscle movement generates thought. Removing audience awareness (temporarily) removes paralyzing constraints.

**Key insight** (Elbow): Freewriting's power comes partly from ignoring audience. When you're not worried about readers judging you, you can access thoughts you might otherwise censor.

---

### Textual Accumulation (Deepened)

**Definition**: The deliberate building of a corpus over time. Rather than treating each writing task as separate, you accumulate fragments that become material for future work.

**Week 1**: Introduced implicitly through fragment production.

**Week 2**: Made explicit. Writing substitutes capital for labor—but labor must first create the capital. The fragments you write now become capital you can draw on later. Not every fragment needs to be useful; you're building abundance so that when you need material, you have options.

**How it differs from traditional assignments**: Traditional model—write paper, submit, move on. Accumulation model—write fragment, store, connect later, draw on when needed.

## Block-by-Block Plan

### Block 1 (W): Freewriting and Fragment Work

**Opening** (3 min): Welcome to Week 2. This week we build the system that holds your writing. Today: more freewriting practice, with attention to the techniques that make it work.

**Main** (20 min): Freewriting practice.
- First sprint (5 min): Open prompt—write about anything. Keep the hand moving.
- Brief pause (2 min): Notice what happened. Did you get stuck? Did something emerge?
- Second sprint (5 min): Focused prompt—write about a time you learned something difficult.
- Remaining time: Review what you generated. Mark anything worth developing.

**Closing** (2 min): Freewriting generates raw material. Tomorrow we set up where that material will live.

---

### Block 2 (T1): Index Cards + OneDrive Folder Setup

**Opening** (3 min): Today's tech block introduces your capture and storage tools. Index cards for fast capture; OneDrive folders for persistent storage.

**Main** (20 min): Setup work.

**Index cards** (8 min):
- Distribute cards (or confirm students have them)
- Demonstrate card anatomy: front (idea, date), back (context, connections)
- Practice: capture one idea from yesterday's freewriting onto a card
- Discuss: cards are for thinking, not permanence. Toss freely.

**OneDrive folders** (12 min):
- Navigate to OneDrive; create course folder structure
- Recommended structure: `ENGL101/Fragments/`, `ENGL101/Drafts/`, `ENGL101/Feedback/`
- Discuss naming conventions: `YYYY-MM-DD_descriptive-name.docx`
- Practice: create one fragment file with proper naming

**Closing** (2 min): Cards capture fast; folders store persistently. Tomorrow we add sharing.

See: [[index-cards-guide-course-v101]], [[folder-structure-guide-course-v101]]

---

### Block 3 (T2): Eli Review Introduction

**Opening** (3 min): Eli Review is where your writing becomes visible to readers beyond yourself. Today is familiarization—no graded work yet.

**Main** (20 min): Eli Review orientation.
- Account setup and course enrollment (5 min)
- Platform tour: how reviews work, how feedback appears (5 min)
- Ungraded practice: submit a short fragment, receive peer feedback (10 min)

**Closing** (2 min): Eli Review adds sharing to your workflow. Cards capture → folders store → Eli shares. You'll use this throughout the semester.

See: [[eli-review-intro-course-v101]]

---

### Block 4 (W): Writing with New Systems

**Opening** (2 min): Now that your system exists, practice using it. Today's writing goes through the full workflow: capture → store → (eventually) share.

**Main** (21 min): Fragment production with system practice.
- Freewriting sprint (5 min): Respond to Ong—what surprised you? What confused you?
- Capture to card (3 min): Pull one idea onto an index card
- Transfer to OneDrive (5 min): Create a properly named fragment file
- Continue writing (8 min): Develop the fragment further in the digital file

**Closing** (2 min): Notice the workflow: generate (freewriting) → capture (card) → store (file). You'll repeat this pattern all semester.

---

### Block 5 (W): Fragment Development

**Opening** (2 min): Continue building your corpus. Today's focus: quantity. Generate more material.

**Main** (21 min): Extended writing time.
- Freewriting sprint (5 min): What does Ong mean that writing is "artificial"? Why is that good?
- Fragment development (16 min): Work on any fragment—new or continuing from earlier

**Closing** (2 min): How many fragments do you have now? Accumulation is working.

---

### Block 6 (W): Fragment Development

**Opening** (2 min): Final block of Week 2. Continue accumulating.

**Main** (21 min): Extended writing time.
- Option A: Start new fragment responding to README examples—what would a README for your writing process look like?
- Option B: Continue developing existing fragments
- Option C: Review and organize—ensure files are properly named, cards are captured

**Closing** (2 min): Week 2 complete. You have a system now: cards, folders, Eli. Next week we add process documentation and encounter our first difficult reading.

---

## Assignments

### Fragment Production (Ongoing)

**Continuing from Week 1**: Keep accumulating fragments. Aim for at least 3-4 new fragments this week, properly named and stored in your OneDrive folder.

**This week's emphasis**: Practice the full workflow. Generate via freewriting → capture on cards → store in folders with meaningful names.

---

### Reading Response Fragment

**Due**: Before Week 3

**Task**: Write a fragment (150-300 words) responding to Ong. Possible angles:
- What does Ong mean by "artificial"? Why does he consider this praise?
- How does writing "restructure consciousness"? Do you notice this in your own experience?
- What connections do you see between Ong's argument and the tools we set up this week?

**Purpose**: Practice connecting reading to writing. This fragment becomes part of your accumulating corpus.

---

### System Setup Checklist

**Complete by end of Week 2**:
- [ ] Index cards obtained (or alternative capture tool identified)
- [ ] OneDrive folder structure created
- [ ] Naming convention established and practiced
- [ ] Eli Review account set up and course enrolled
- [ ] At least one fragment saved with proper naming

---

## Concept Connections

### Six-Move Framework: Capture Focus

Week 1 previewed all six moves. Week 2 emphasizes **capture**—getting ideas out of your head and into a system where they can be found later.

| Move | Week 2 Status |
|------|---------------|
| **Capture** | **Primary focus**: Index cards, freewriting, fragment production |
| Classify | Light touch: folder structure begins organizing |
| Route | Light touch: deciding what goes where |
| Distill | Not yet emphasized |
| Connect | Previewed via graph thinking concept |
| Publish | Not yet emphasized |

### Future Self as Audience

Your most important audience this week is future-you:
- Future-you who needs to find a fragment
- Future-you who won't remember when you wrote something
- Future-you who will thank present-you for meaningful file names

This reframes "organization" from arbitrary requirement to purposeful infrastructure.

### Building Toward Later Weeks

| Week 2 Concept | Returns In | Connection |
|----------------|------------|------------|
| Graph thinking | Week 10 | Bush's "associative trails" in the memex |
| Textual accumulation | Throughout | Corpus growth; portfolio assembly (M4) |
| Writing as technology | Week 13 | Bernstein's "psychic surgery" intensifies Ong |
| Future self as audience | Week 13 | Process Archaeology reads your past documentation |
| Freewriting | Throughout | Generative technique for all fragment production |

---

## Looking Ahead

**Week 3**: Salvatori's "Conversations with Texts" introduces difficulty-as-diagnostic—the idea that struggle with reading signals something worth investigating. Development logs begin: documenting process, not just product. The course's first "difficult reading" arrives.

**Week 10**: Graph thinking returns with Bush's "As We May Think" and the memex vision—trails of association across accumulated material.
