## Overview

This document ensures systematic concept coverage across weekly syntheses by:
1. Mapping concepts to weeks and readings
2. Tracking concept frequency (flexible vs. anchored)
3. Identifying concepts that require specific week placement
4. Providing planning recommendations for each week type

---

| **Difficulty-as-Diagnostic** | Resistance as informational signal, not obstacle | Week 3 | 5, 7, 10 | Salvatori (central), Alexander (misfits) |

### Tier 2: Theoretical Depth (Introduce Mid-Semester, Develop Later)

| Framework | Definition | Introduction | Returns | Reading Anchors |
|-----------|------------|--------------|---------|-----------------|

### Tier 3: Connecting Concepts (Appear Once or Twice, Link to Larger Frameworks)

| Concept | Definition | Week(s) | Reading Connection |
|---------|------------|---------|-------------------|

---

## Part 4: Difficulty Reading Pairs

These create return-and-deepen opportunities that syntheses should explicitly connect.

| Pair | Reading 1 | Week | Reading 2 | Week | Thematic Link |
|------|-----------|------|-----------|------|---------------|
| **A** | Salvatori | 3 | Star | 10 | Visibility/Surfacing: making invisible structures visible |
| **B** | Meadows | 5 | Alexander | 7 | Intervention/Fit: where and when to intervene in systems |

### Synthesis Guidance

- **Week 10 synthesis**: Must explicitly reference Week 3's Salvatori [[@salvatori1996conve]]—completing Pair A
- **Week 7 synthesis**: Must explicitly reference Week 5's Meadows [[@meadows2008lever]]—completing Pair B

---

## Part 5: Movement Transitions

These weeks mark phase shifts—syntheses should acknowledge what's changing.

| Transition | Week | From | To | Synthesis Should Address |
|------------|------|------|----|--------------------------|
| M1 → M2 | 4 | Surfacing | Naming | Expansion → structure; raw material → classification |
| M2 → M3 | 8 | Naming | Operating at Scale | Individual fragments → corpus management |
| M3 → M4 | 12 | Operating at Scale | Synthesis | Accumulation → selection and polish |

---

## Part 6: Assignment-Concept Connections

Which assignments make which concepts tangible?

| Assignment | Weeks | Concepts Made Concrete |
|------------|-------|------------------------|
| **Envelope Exercise** | 1, 15 | Time-capsule, trajectory evidence, fragment as raw material |
| **Literacy Narrative** | 3-5 | Writing-as-verb → writing-as-noun, revision cycles |
| **Spec Document** | 5-6 | Constraint articulation, intentions before execution |
| **Constraint Audit** | 6-7 | Constraint decomposition, permission flags, Alexander misfits |
| **BEAM Source Entries** | 7-8 | Citation as dependency, source function taxonomy |
| **BEAM Portfolio** | 10-11 | Accumulation at scale, infrastructure building |
| **Documented Inquiry** | 11-12 | Six-move completion, publication as transformation |
| **Process Archaeology** | 12-13 | Mill/store, evidence-based reflection, metacognition |
| **Transfer Proposal** | 15 | Constraint sequencing as transferable strategic choice |

---

## Part 7: Tech Instruction Anchors

When technology enters, synthesis can reflect on tool-concept relationships.

| Tech Block | Week | Tool Focus | Concept Connection |
|------------|------|------------|-------------------|
| T1-T2 | 2 | Index cards + OneDrive + Eli intro | Six-move (capture, route), Graph thinking |
| T3-T4 | 5 | Zotero (library) | Citation as dependency, BEAM preparation |
| T5 | 8 | "What You're Automating" | Automation as meaning-transport, mill/store |
| T6 | 13 | Optional advanced demo | Infrastructure choice, graceful degradation |

---

## Part 8: Special Weeks

| Week | Type | Synthesis Focus |
|------|------|-----------------|
| 1 | Course entry | Hook, envelope exercise meaning, Kirschenbaum complication, six-move preview |
| 9 | Conference week | No reading synthesis; preparation for individual conferences |
| 14 | Presentations | No reading synthesis; student demonstration of integrated understanding |
| 15 | Final week | Envelope return, trajectory comparison, transfer proposition, course arc completion |

---

## Part 9: Thematic Threads to Track

These themes should appear multiple times across the semester. Synthesis sections should occasionally make these explicit.

1. **"Nothing is wasted"** — Fragments accumulate value; early rough work feeds later polish
2. **"Constraints enable"** — Limits create possibility, not just restriction
3. **"Difficulty is informational"** — Struggle reveals assumptions, not just problems
4. **"Infrastructure becomes invisible"** — Success makes systems disappear
5. **"Writing is both labor and capital"** — Process produces products that circulate
6. **"Citations are relationships"** — Not mechanical compliance but intellectual connection
7. **"Transfer requires naming"** — What you can name, you can move to new contexts

---

## Part 10: Concept Frequency Analysis

### High-Frequency Concepts (4+ appearances)

_Flexible—can move across weeks as needed_

| Concept | Appearances | Weeks | Flexibility Notes |
|---------|-------------|-------|-------------------|
| **Six-Move Framework** | 6 | 1, 2, 5, 8, 11, 13 | Most flexible; operational vocabulary that fits anywhere |
| **Writing-as-Verb/Noun** | 6 | 1, 5, 8, 12, 15, (implicit throughout) | Core distinction; can appear whenever portfolio/process discussed |
| **Difficulty-as-Diagnostic** | 6 | 3, 5, 7, 10, (Pair A, Pair B) | Anchored to Salvatori (Week 3) but returns naturally with any challenging reading |
| **Fragment/Corpus Model** | 6 | 1, 3, 6, 8, 12, (operational) | Operational vocabulary; can mention whenever fragment production discussed |
| **Constraint Sequencing** | 5 | 4-5, 7, 9, 13 | Central innovation; fits any week with assignment/constraint discussion |
| **Textual Accumulation** | 5 | 1-2, 6, 8, 11 | Flexible; fits whenever corpus growth is visible |
| **Process Documentation** | 5 | 2-3, 9, 11, 15 | Returns with dev logs, system maps, process archaeology |

### Medium-Frequency Concepts (2-3 appearances)

_Semi-flexible—have preferred locations but can shift_

| Concept | Appearances | Weeks | Flexibility Notes |
|---------|-------------|-------|-------------------|
| **Citation as Dependency** | 3 | 5-6, 8, 11 | Anchored to Zotero intro (Week 5) but can appear with any source work |
| **Corpse → Compost → Garden** | 3 | 6-7, 11-12, 15 | Anchored to Jackson (Week 6) but powerful at any synthesis moment |
| **Infrastructure Invisibility** | 3 | 10, 13, (implicit 8) | Strongly anchored to Star (Week 10)—limited flexibility |
| **Leverage Points** | 3 | 5, 7, 9 | Anchored to Meadows (Week 5)—Pair B connection limits flexibility |
| **Permission Flags** | 2 | 7, 11, 13 | Anchored to Alexander (Week 7) but can appear with constraint audit |
| **Mill/Store Metaphor** | 2 | 8, 11 | Anchored to Brooks (Week 8)—semi-flexible for M3 |
| **Goodness of Fit** | 2 | 7, 12 | Strongly anchored to Alexander (Week 7)—Pair B limits movement |
| **Affordances** | 2 | 12, (implicit 7) | Strongly anchored to Norman (Week 12) |
| **Graph as Ur-Structure** | 2 | 2, 10 | Semi-anchored to Ong (Week 2), returns with Bush (Week 10) |

### Concepts with Single Introduction Points (Highly Constrained)

_Fixed anchors—these weeks must accommodate these concepts_

| Concept | Week | Anchor Reason | Cannot Move Because |
|---------|------|---------------|---------------------|
| **Envelope Exercise** | 1, 15 | Only activity of its kind | Structural bookend—defines course arc |
| **Metacognitive Interruption** | 3 | Salvatori-specific vocabulary | Only introduced with Salvatori reading |
| **Rhetorical Situation** | 4 | Downs-specific | Only reading addressing this directly |
| **Classification Systems** | 6 | Borges/Library-specific | Only reading addressing information anxiety |
| **Essential vs. Accidental Complexity** | 8 | Brooks-specific | Only source for this distinction |
| **Boundary Objects** | 10 | Star-specific | Only source for this concept |
| **Memex Vision** | 10 | Bush-specific | Only source; historical anchor |
| **Maintenance Labor** | 11 | Ribes & Jackson-specific | Only reading addressing data care |
| **Revision as Meaning-Making** | 13 | Bernstein-specific | Only reading treating revision this way |
| **BEAM Framework** | 6-8 | Assignment sequence | Tied to peer review cycles 4-5 |
| **SEAR Procedure** | 6 | Instructor prompt 4.3 | Tied to specific prompt timing |

---

## Part 11: Week Anchor Analysis

### Weeks with Multiple Single-Introduction Concepts (Most Constrained)

_These weeks have the least flexibility—plan other concepts around them_

| Week | Single-Introduction Concepts | Implication |
|------|------------------------------|-------------|
| **Week 1** | Envelope exercise | FIXED: Course entry, cannot shift |
| **Week 3** | Metacognitive interruption, Difficulty Pair A begins | FIXED: Salvatori must introduce difficulty pedagogy here |
| **Week 6** | Classification systems, Jackson intro | SEMI-FIXED: Borges/classification anchored; some flexibility in how Jackson connects |
| **Week 8** | Essential/accidental complexity | SEMI-FIXED: Brooks must anchor M3 opening |
| **Week 10** | Boundary objects, Memex, Difficulty Pair A completes | FIXED: Star + Bush combo; must complete Salvatori connection |
| **Week 11** | Maintenance labor | SEMI-FIXED: Ribes & Jackson only source |
| **Week 13** | Revision as meaning-making | SEMI-FIXED: Bernstein only source |
| **Week 15** | Envelope return, Transfer proposal | FIXED: Course exit, cannot shift |

### Weeks with High Flexibility (Fewest Anchors)

_These weeks can absorb concepts shifted from anchored weeks_

| Week | Fixed Elements | Available Capacity |
|------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Week 2** | Tech instruction (T1-T2), Ong reading | HIGH: Can emphasize six-move, graph thinking, process documentation variably |
| **Week 4** | Downs reading, M2 transition | MEDIUM: Rhetorical situation fixed, but constraint sequencing discussion flexible |
| **Week 5** | Meadows, Zotero (T3-T4), Pair B begins | MEDIUM: Leverage points anchored, but citation/accumulation flexible |
| **Week 7** | Alexander, Pair B completes | MEDIUM: Goodness of fit anchored, but permission flags/constraint audit flexible |
| **Week 9** | Conference week (no reading) | HIGH: All concepts available for individual application |
| **Week 12** | Norman, M4 transition | MEDIUM: Affordances anchored, but portfolio/corpse-garden flexible |

### Flexibility Matrix Summary

| Flexibility Level | Weeks | Planning Approach |
|-------------------|-------|-------------------|
| **LOCKED** | 1, 15 | Course bookends—design others around these |
| **ANCHORED** | 3, 6, 8, 10, 11, 13 | Reading-specific single-introduction concepts—plan flexible concepts to fill around |
| **SEMI-FLEXIBLE** | 4, 5, 7, 12 | Some fixed, some movable—balance anchored and flexible |
| **FLEXIBLE** | 2, 9 | Most freedom—use to absorb overflow or deepen key themes |
| **N/A** | 14 | Presentations—no synthesis content |

---

## Part 12: Planning Recommendations

### For Anchored Weeks (3, 6, 8, 10, 11, 13)

**Strategy**: Introduce the single-introduction concept fully, then connect it to high-frequency concepts that could appear anywhere.

**Example for Week 10**: 
- **Fixed**: Star [[@star1999ethnp]] (infrastructure invisibility, boundary objects), Bush [[@bush1945thinl]] (memex), Difficulty Pair A completion
- **Flexible additions**: Six-move (connect → infrastructure enables connection), Writing-as-noun (memex as frozen capital), Graph thinking (Bush's associative trails)

### For Flexible Weeks (2, 9)

**Strategy**: Use these weeks to:
1. Deepen concepts introduced elsewhere
2. Make cross-week connections explicit
3. Catch up on concepts that got crowded out of anchored weeks

**Example for Week 9 (conferences)**:
- No reading synthesis needed
- Individual student application of all concepts
- Synthesis could briefly frame conferences as constraint sequencing in action (choosing what to work on = leverage point decisions)

### For Transition Weeks (4, 8, 12)

**Strategy**: Use movement transitions to explicitly name the phase shift, which provides natural context for several concepts simultaneously.

**Example for Week 8 (M2 → M3)**:
- **Fixed**: Brooks [[@brooks1986silve]] (essential/accidental complexity)
- **Transition-natural**: Mill/store (now you have material—what transforms it?), Six-move (shifting from capture/classify toward distill/connect), Accumulation (corpus reaches critical mass)

---

## Part 13: Danger Zones

### Concepts at Risk of Being Dropped

These concepts have limited appearances AND limited reading anchors—ensure they're not crowded out:

| Concept | Risk | Mitigation |
|---------|------|------------|
| Permission flags | Only explicitly tied to Week 7 | Connect to any constraint/audit discussion |
| Stocks/flows | Only explicitly tied to Week 5 | Connect to accumulation language throughout |
| Graceful degradation | Only explicitly tied to Week 8 | Could mention when discussing partial drafts or iterative work |
| SEAR procedure | Only explicitly tied to Week 6 | Could return in any source-integration context |

### Concepts at Risk of Over-Repetition

These concepts appear frequently—avoid making them feel repetitive:

| Concept | Risk | Mitigation |
|---------|------|------------|
| Six-move framework | Could become mechanical | Emphasize different moves in different weeks (M1 = capture; M2 = classify/route; M3 = distill/connect; M4 = publish) |
| Difficulty-as-diagnostic | Could feel preachy | Vary the examples; connect to different readings each time |
| Fragment/corpus | Could feel like nag | Let it be operational after Week 3; only foreground when there's new insight |

---

## Part 14: Usage Checklist

When generating each weekly synthesis:

- [ ] Check this inventory for **concepts due for introduction** this week
- [ ] Check for **concepts due for return/deepening** this week
- [ ] Note if this week **completes a difficulty pair** requiring explicit backward reference
- [ ] Note if this week is a **movement transition** requiring phase-shift acknowledgment
- [ ] Identify which **thematic threads** naturally connect to this week's reading/activities
- [ ] Verify no concept is being introduced that was already introduced (unless intentional deepening)
- [ ] Check **single-introduction status**: if anchored week, plan flexible concepts around fixed elements
- [ ] Check **danger zones**: ensure at-risk concepts aren't being dropped or over-repeated
