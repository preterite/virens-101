# Difficulty Pair Updates - Week 3 Overview

**NEW Pair A Description (Salvatori + Alexander):**

These two readings come from very different worlds—composition pedagogy and design theory—but they converge on a shared insight: the moment something goes wrong is the moment real learning begins. Salvatori asks you to pay close attention to what feels difficult when you read, because the difficulty itself usually contains the key to understanding the text. Alexander asks designers to pay close attention to where their solution doesn't fit the problem, because the misfit itself usually contains the key to a better design.

As you read them together, notice how both authors treat the vague feeling of "this isn't working" as a starting point, not an ending point. Both insist that you have to get specific—not just "this is hard" but "this particular thing is hard in this particular way for this particular reason." That specificity is where the real work happens, whether you're reading a text or designing a system. And writing, we'll argue, is always both.
