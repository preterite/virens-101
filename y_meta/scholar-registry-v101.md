# Scholar Registry

This note defines the controlled vocabulary for the `cites-scholars` field used in reasons/justification notes and serves as the authoritative citekey lookup reference for the VIRENS 101 course and the Kairos webtext article. All citekeys verified against `~/Local/virens/user1/Scholar/references/library.bib`.

---

## How to Use

**For YAML frontmatter** — use short names (last name) from the tables below:

```yaml
cites-scholars: [Salvatori, Alexander, Meadows]
primary-theorist: Salvatori
```

**For prose citations** — use citekeys from the Citekey Reference below:

```markdown
Salvatori [[@salvatori1996conve]] argues that difficulty is diagnostic...
```

**Two-mention convention:** citekey on first prose mention + bibliography/references section. Never in headings or body-text tables.

**Multi-work authors:** Check context maps below for which citekey to use.

## ⚠️ Phantom Citekeys — Used in Vault but Not in library.bib

These citekeys appear in vault files but have no corresponding Bookends entry. They need library.bib entries created, or the vault references need correction.

**Needs Bookends entry created:**

| Citekey | Work | Used In |
|---------|------|---------|
| `elbow1993ranki` | "Ranking, Evaluating, and Liking" (*College English* 55.2, 1993) | 11 files across grading/assessment reasons |
| `elbow1986portf` | "Portfolios as a Substitute for Proficiency Examinations" (with Belanoff, *CCC* 37.3, 1986) | M4-synthesis-overview-reasons |
| `elireview2025givi` | Eli Review giving feedback framework (2025) | 8 DES protocol files |
| `braxton2004under` | Braxton et al., student retention research (2004) | withdrawal-policy-reasons |

| `dweck2006minds` | Dweck, *Mindset* (Random House, 2006) | withdrawal-policy-reasons |

**Action required:** Add these 7 works to Bookends, re-export library.bib, then verify citekeys match the format above.

## Maintenance

**When adding a new Bookends entry:**
1. Export library.bib from Bookends
2. Add the citekey to the appropriate discipline section above
3. If multi-work author, add to Context Maps
4. Add short name to frontmatter arrays if new author

**When citing a new scholar in vault files:**
1. Check this registry for existing citekey
2. If not found, check library.bib directly
3. If not in library.bib, create Bookends entry first
4. Update this registry

**Periodic sync:** Run a comparison script between library.bib and this registry to catch drift. See `citekey-conventions-workflow.md` for the full workflow.
