## Common Student Issues & Solutions

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Can't log into Eli Review | Check email for invitation link; reset password |
| Zotero not installing | Campus IT has deployment package; direct student to help desk |
| OneDrive storage full | WSU provides 1TB; if full, student needs to clean up other files |
| Lost index cards | No backup for physical media; student starts fresh, notes loss in dev log |
| Forgot naming convention | Provide quick-reference card; schedule 30-min folder cleanup |
| Eli Review reviews not visible | Check task deadline; feedback appears after review deadline closes |
