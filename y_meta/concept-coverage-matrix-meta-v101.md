## Part 2: Pending Weeks Analysis

### Week-by-Week Constraint Assessment

| Week | Movement | Reading | Fixed Elements | Flexible Elements | Constraint Level |
|------|----------|---------|----------------|-------------------|------------------|
| **2** | M1 | Ong + READMEs | T1-T2 (tech instruction), Ong reading | Six-move depth, Graph thinking, Process documentation emphasis | **LOW** |
| **5** | M2 | Meadows | T3-T4 (Zotero), Difficulty Pair B begins, Eli Cycle 1, Leverage points (ONESIE) | Citation as dependency timing, Stocks/flows depth | **MEDIUM-HIGH** |
| **7** | M2 | Alexander | Difficulty Pair B completes, Eli Cycle 3, Goodness of fit (ONESIE), Constraint Audit due | Permission flags, BEAM expansion | **HIGH** |
| **9** | M3 | None | Conference week, No reading | All concepts available for individual application | **LOW** (special) |
| **10** | M3 | Star + Bush | Difficulty Pair A completes, Infrastructure invisibility (ONESIE), Memex vision (ONESIE), Boundary objects (ONESIE), Eli Cycle 5 | Graph thinking return | **VERY HIGH** |

| **15** | M4 | None | Envelope return, Final Portfolio, Transfer Proposal | Course arc completion | **LOCKED** (bookend) |

### Constraint Level Definitions

- **VERY HIGH**: Multiple ONESIES + Difficulty Pair completion + specific assignment anchors
- **HIGH**: ONESIE(s) + Difficulty Pair endpoint OR Movement transition
- **MEDIUM-HIGH**: ONESIE(s) OR significant assignment anchor
- **MEDIUM**: Reading anchor but flexible concept placement
- **LOW**: Few fixed elements; can absorb overflow or deepen as needed
- **N/A**: Special week (presentations, conferences)
- **LOCKED**: Course bookend; structure fixed

## Part 5: Batch Recommendations

### Batch Priority Order (Most → Least Constrained)

**BATCH A: VERY HIGH / HIGH Constraint** (Do First)
1. **Week 10** — VERY HIGH: Three ONESIES (infrastructure invisibility, boundary objects, memex) + Difficulty Pair A completion + Star [[@star1999ethnp]]/Bush [[@bush1945thinl]] readings
2. **Week 7** — HIGH: Three ONESIES (goodness of fit, constraint decomposition, permission flags) + Difficulty Pair B completion + Alexander [[@alexander1964notet]] reading
3. **Week 12** — HIGH: ONESIE (affordances) + M3→M4 transition + Norman [[@norman2013desig]] reading

**BATCH B: MEDIUM-HIGH Constraint** (Do Second)
4. **Week 5** — MEDIUM-HIGH: Two ONESIES (leverage points, stocks/flows) + Difficulty Pair B begins + Zotero + Meadows [[@meadows2008lever]] reading
5. **Week 11** — MEDIUM-HIGH: ONESIE (maintenance labor) + BEAM Portfolio due + Ribes [[@ribes2013datb]] & Jackson reading
6. **Week 13** — MEDIUM-HIGH: ONESIE (revision as meaning-making) + Process Archaeology + Bernstein reading

**BATCH C: LOW Constraint / Special** (Do Last)
7. **Week 2** — LOW: Tech instruction; flexible concept deepening
8. **Week 9** — LOW (special): Conference week; no reading synthesis needed
9. **Week 15** — LOCKED bookend: Course arc completion; envelope return

**SKIP** (No synthesis content needed)
- Week 14 — Presentations week

## Part 6: Dependency Chains

Some weeks depend on others being completed first:

### Chain 1: Difficulty Pair A
```
Week 3 (Salvatori) ✅ → Week 10 (Star) ⏳
```
Week 10 must explicitly reference Week 3's difficulty pedagogy.

### Chain 2: Difficulty Pair B
```
Week 5 (Meadows) ⏳ → Week 7 (Alexander) ⏳
```
Week 7 must explicitly reference Week 5's leverage points.

**Implication**: Week 5 should be generated before Week 7.

### Chain 3: BEAM Arc
```
Week 6 (introduced) ✅ → Week 7 (expanded) ⏳ → Week 8 (source entries) ✅ → Week 10-11 (portfolio) ⏳
```
BEAM framework builds across M2-M3.

### Chain 4: Infrastructure Thread
```
Week 8 (essential/accidental) ✅ → Week 10 (Star infrastructure) ⏳ → Week 11 (maintenance) ⏳ → Week 13 (optional T6) ⏳
```

---

## Part 7: Revised Batch Sequence

Given dependency chains, optimal generation order:

### BATCH A (Constrained + Dependencies Satisfied)
1. **Week 5** — Difficulty Pair B begins; must precede Week 7
2. **Week 7** — Difficulty Pair B completes; depends on Week 5
3. **Week 10** — Difficulty Pair A completes; depends on Week 3 (✅)
4. **Week 12** — M3→M4 transition; no upstream dependencies

### BATCH B (Medium Constraint)
5. **Week 11** — Follows Week 10 infrastructure thread
6. **Week 13** — Follows Week 11 process documentation

### BATCH C (Low Constraint / Cleanup)
7. **Week 2** — Flexible; can draft anytime
8. **Week 9** — Conference week; minimal synthesis
9. **Week 15** — Final; benefits from seeing full arc

## Part 8: Risk Assessment

### Concepts at Risk of Being Dropped

| Concept | Current Status | Risk | Mitigation |
|---------|----------------|------|------------|
| Stocks/flows | Not yet introduced | Medium | Must appear in Week 5 (Meadows) |
| Permission flags | Not yet introduced | Medium | Must appear in Week 7 (Alexander) |
| Graph thinking | Not yet introduced | Low | Week 2 (Ong) + Week 10 (Bush) |

### Concepts at Risk of Over-Repetition

| Concept | Appearances So Far | Risk | Mitigation |
|---------|-------------------|------|------------|
| Six-move framework | 4 (W1, W4, W6, W8) | Medium | Vary emphasis: W11 distill/connect, W13 publish |
| Difficulty-as-diagnostic | 2 (W3, W6 touch) | Low | Natural with Pair readings |
| Constraint sequencing | 3 (W4, W6, W8) | Low | Core innovation; varied contexts |

### DANGER ZONES to Monitor

| Concept | Risk | Status |
|---------|------|--------|
| Graceful degradation | Could become excuse for sloppiness | ✅ ADDRESSED W8: "modular components, not load-bearing walls" |
| Six-move vocabulary | Could become mechanical checklist | Monitor; vary emphasis across weeks |
| Mill/store metaphor | Could oversimplify | ✅ ADDRESSED W8: Babbage historical context |

## Part 9: Updated Inventory Corrections

The following corrections should be made to `synthesis-concept-inventory-meta-v101.md`:

| Item | Current | Should Be |
|------|---------|-----------|
| SEAR procedure introduction | Week 6 | **Week 4** (introduced), Week 6 (deepened) |
| Rhetorical situation introduction | Week 4 | ✅ Correct |
| Prompt 4.3 reference | "SEAR" tied to Prompt 4.3 | Prompt 4.3 is "Materiality Circulation," not SEAR |

---

## Part 10: Summary for Batch Discussion

### Most Constrained (Generate First)
1. **Week 5** — Meadows, Zotero, Pair B begins, Eli Cycle 1
2. **Week 7** — Alexander, Pair B completes, Constraint Audit
3. **Week 10** — Star + Bush, Pair A completes, three ONESIES
4. **Week 12** — Norman, M3→M4 transition, affordances ONESIE

### Medium Constrained (Generate Second)
5. **Week 11** — Ribes & Jackson, maintenance ONESIE, BEAM Portfolio
6. **Week 13** — Bernstein, revision ONESIE, Process Archaeology

### Most Flexible (Generate Last)
7. **Week 2** — Tech instruction, Ong [[@ong2012writi]] deepening
8. **Week 9** — Conference week (minimal)
9. **Week 15** — Final week bookend

### Skip
- **Week 14** — Presentations (no synthesis)

## Questions for Batch Planning

1. **Week 5 vs Week 10**: Both are highly constrained, but Week 5 must precede Week 7 (Pair B dependency). Generate Week 5 first in Batch A?

2. **Week 2 timing**: Could be generated anytime. Save for last as flexible buffer, or do early to complete M1 fully?

3. **Week 15**: Should this wait until all other weeks are drafted (to see full arc), or is it sufficiently defined by course structure to draft earlier?

4. **Batch size**: Previous sessions handled 2-3 weeks per batch effectively. Recommend Batch A = 4 weeks (5, 7, 10, 12) or split into two sub-batches?
