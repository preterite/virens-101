## The Six Moves Across Tools

| Move | Index Cards | OneDrive/Word | Zotero | Eli Review | Canvas |
|------|-------------|---------------|--------|------------|--------|
| **Capture** | Primary | Secondary | - | - | - |
| **Classify** | Physical sorting | Folder structure | BEAM tags | - | - |
| **Route** | Card organization | Naming conventions | - | - | - |
| **Distill** | - | Revision | - | Feedback processing | - |
| **Connect** | Back-of-card notes | - | Related sources | - | - |
| **Publish** | - | Final drafts | Bibliography | - | Submission |

---

## Key Principles Embodied

From VIRENS design principles, adapted for first-year students:

1. **Capture-first with minimal structure** (B11): Index cards enable fast capture; structure comes through processing

2. **Graceful degradation** (B13): If one tool fails, others still work; no single point of failure

3. **Manual trigger points** (B10): Students decide when to transfer, when to develop, when to submit—no automation without human decision

4. **Multiple discovery paths** (B12): Search by filename, browse by folder, sort by date, filter by tag

5. **Value accumulation** (C19): Everything saved; fragments compound into portfolio

6. **Documentation as practice** (C20): Dev logs and system maps make process visible

---

## What Success Looks Like

By Week 12, a student should be able to:

1. **Find any fragment** in under 30 seconds (search + naming convention)
2. **See their corpus** at a glance (folder structure + dev log inventory)
3. **Trace a fragment's history** (version history + status codes in filename)
4. **Connect fragments to sources** (Zotero citation integration)
5. **Review their feedback patterns** (Eli Review analytics)
6. **Reflect on their process** (dev log as evidence)

## Documents Created for Instructors

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `instructor-setup-checklist-meta-v101.md` | Pre-semester preparation tasks |
| `tech-stack-overview-meta-v101.md` | This document |
| `tech-wpr-integration-meta-v101.md` | Week-by-week tech/W/P/R integration map |

---

## Why Path A (Eli-Centered)?

**Decision factors**:
1. **Proven pedagogy**: Eli Review has built-in training materials and research backing
2. **Lower instructor burden**: Less development time than OneNote or custom solutions
3. **Clear separation of concerns**: Each tool does one thing well
4. **Adoptable**: Other instructors can use this without heavy customization
5. **Tactile grounding**: Index cards provide physical engagement that digital-only lacks
6. **Cost-effective**: $30-35 total is manageable for first-year students

**Tradeoffs**:
- Eli Review costs $20/student (vs. free alternatives like Canvas peer review)
- Multiple tools mean more potential friction points
- Students need to manage tool integration themselves (not automated)

**Why these tradeoffs are worth it**:
- Eli Review's helpfulness ratings and analytics make feedback more actionable
- Manual integration teaches students to be intentional about tool use
- Multiple tools model real-world writing environments (no all-in-one solution)

---

## Alternative Paths Considered

### Path B: OneNote-Centered

**Components**: OneNote (digital index card box) + OneDrive + Zotero + Canvas peer review

**Why not chosen**:
- OneNote learning curve steeper than index cards
- Canvas peer review lacks helpfulness analytics
- Loses tactile engagement of physical cards
- Higher instructor development burden (creating OneNote templates)

### Path C: Hybrid (Obsidian for advanced users)

**Components**: Index cards + OneDrive + Zotero + Eli Review + optional Obsidian

**Why not chosen**:
- Obsidian too complex for required use in first-year course
- Splits student cohort into "haves" (Obsidian) and "have-nots"
- Instructor would need to support two parallel systems

**Note**: Obsidian can be mentioned in T6 (Week 13) as "aspirational" tool

---

## Scalability & Adoption

### For Other Instructors

**Minimum requirements to adopt Path A**:
- Campus OneDrive/Office 365 access (or equivalent: Google Drive/Docs)
- Eli Review site license or willingness to have students pay $20
- Library staff willing to teach Zotero session
- Index cards ($10-15 per student)

**Time investment**:
- Pre-semester setup: 8-10 hours
- In-class tech instruction: 6 blocks (150 min)
- Ongoing tech support: 1-2 hours per week

**Customization points**:
- Folder structure (can simplify if needed)
- Naming convention (can adapt to instructor preference)
- Dev log format (can use prompts vs. freeform)
- Eli Review prompts (can customize per assignment)

### For Different Class Sizes

**< 20 students**: Path A works as-is

**20-30 students**: Path A works; Eli Review matching algorithm handles it

**30+ students**: Consider TA support for tech troubleshooting; Eli Review scales well but grading load increases

---

## Common Instructor Questions

### "Can students use Google Docs instead of Word?"

Yes. Zotero has a Google Docs plugin. Folder structure translates to Google Drive. Update documentation accordingly.

### "What if my institution doesn't have Eli Review?"

Use Canvas peer review + custom helpfulness rating form. You'll lose analytics but core pedagogy holds.

### "Can I skip index cards?"

You can, but you'll lose the tactile thinking and physical sorting. Consider at least requiring them through Week 8.

### "What if students don't have money for Eli Review?"

Check if your writing program or library has bulk licensing. If not, consider Canvas peer review or printing fees waiver fund.

### "How do I grade dev logs?"

Participation rubric: 10 pts per entry for completion + substance. Don't grade for "correctness"—it's process documentation.

## Assessment Integration

### How Tech Affects Grading

| Grade Component | Tech Connection | Points |
|----------------|----------------|--------|
| **Portfolio** | Assembled from OneDrive corpus | 450 |
| **Eli Review cycles** | 6 cycles × 40 pts each | 240 |
| **Dev log entries** | 10 entries × 10 pts each | 100 |
| **Process documentation** | System maps in OneDrive | Participation grade |
| **Major assignments** | Developed via fragment accumulation | 150 (3 × 50) |

**Total course points**: 1000

**Tech-mediated points**: ~790 (79%)

Most of the course is mediated through the tech stack, which is why setup and troubleshooting matter.
