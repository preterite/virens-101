# Difficulty Pair Restructuring - Final Report

**Date started:** 2026-02-12  
**Date completed:** 2026-02-13  
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE — ARCHIVED**

---

## Executive Summary

Successfully restructured difficulty pair assignments from tangled 7-week pairing to tighter 4-5 week pairings. All 35 files (5 architecture + 30 reading files) updated with new pairings and thematic frameworks.

**Old pairings:**
- Pair A: Salvatori (W3) + Star (W10) — 7-week gap
- Pair B: Meadows (W5) + Alexander (W7) — 2-week gap

**New pairings:**
- **Pair A:** Salvatori (W3) + Alexander (W7) — "Failure as Diagnostic" (4-week gap)
- **Pair B:** Meadows (W5) + Star (W10) — "Seeing Invisible Systems" (5-week gap)
- **Bush:** Removed from difficulty pair structure (now independent reading, W10)

**Rationale:** Temporal proximity matters for pedagogical effectiveness. The tighter gaps create stronger complementary pairings.

## New Difficulty Pair Frameworks

### Pair A: Failure as Diagnostic (Salvatori W3 → Alexander W7)

**Student-facing language:**
> These two readings come from very different worlds—composition pedagogy and design theory—but they converge on a shared insight: the moment something goes wrong is the moment real learning begins. Salvatori asks you to pay close attention to what feels difficult when you read, because the difficulty itself usually contains the key to understanding the text. Alexander asks designers to pay close attention to where their solution doesn't fit the problem, because the misfit itself usually contains the key to a better design.

**Pedagogical principle:**
> Difficulty is where misfit becomes visible. When readers struggle, when something doesn't land, when an argument feels forced—those are the high spots in the metal face, the ink marks that reveal where grinding is needed.

### Pair B: Seeing Invisible Systems (Meadows W5 → Star W10)

**Student-facing language:**
> Meadows and Star are both asking you to see things that are designed to be invisible. Meadows gives you a vocabulary—stocks, flows, feedback loops, leverage points—for describing systems that are operating all around you but that you've never had words for. Star gives you a method—ethnographic attention to infrastructure—for noticing structures that have become so successful they've disappeared into the background of "just how things are."

**Pedagogical principle:**
> Meadows teaches you to draw the system. Star teaches you to ask the harder question: who built this system, whose values does it encode, and what happens to people who don't fit its categories?
