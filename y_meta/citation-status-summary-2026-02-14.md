## What Remains (Minimal Work)

### Priority 1: Complete Elbow Integration (6 files)

**Estimated time:** 30-45 minutes

Files to process:
1. h_policies/grading-assessment-reasons-v101.md
2. h_policies/late-work-policy-reasons-v101.md
3. h_policies/communication-expectations-reasons-v101.md
4. c_rationale/assessment-overview-reasons-v101.md
5. c_rationale/citation-as-dependency-reasons-v101.md
6. b_overview/M4-synthesis-overview-reasons-v101.md

**Method:** Read each file for context, determine appropriate Elbow citekey based on context clues, add on first mention.

**Citekey decision rules:**
- Freewriting/process → `[[@elbow1973writi]]`
- Contraries/dialectic → `[[@elbow1983embra]]`
- Ranking/evaluation → `[[@elbow1993ranki]]`

### Priority 2: General Citation Integration (3 files)

**Estimated time:** 15-20 minutes

Files to process:
1. e_outcomes/course-outcomes-reasons-v101.md
2. h_policies/withdrawal-policy-reasons-v101.md
3. h_policies/emergency-procedures-reasons-v101.md

**Method:** Add appropriate scholar citekeys from library.bib based on file content.

## Total Remaining Work

**9 files** need attention:
- 6 Elbow-specific
- 3 general citations

**Estimated total time:** 45-60 minutes

After this, you'll be at **100% completion** for Phases 1-3.

## Correction to Original Estimates

| Original Tracking | Actual Reality |
|------------------|----------------|
| 36 rationale files | 72 rationale files |
| 17/36 complete (47%) | 69/72 complete (95%) |
| 60-80 hours remaining | 1 hour remaining |
| 154 Kirschenbaum instances | 5 files (complete) |
| 150 Elbow instances | 20 files (14 done) |

The original tracker was **dramatically underestimating progress** because it only counted c_rationale/ directory work and didn't recognize all the vault-wide work you'd already completed in various sessions.

---

## Next Action

**Immediate:** Process the 6 Elbow files (30-45 minutes)

I can start with file #1 right now if you'd like me to proceed, or you can review the audit documents first:
- [[citation-audit-comprehensive-2026-02-14]] — Full audit report
- [[citation-integration-progress]] — Updated tracker (now accurate)

## Files Created/Updated This Session

✅ Created: `y_meta/citation-audit-comprehensive-2026-02-14.md`  
✅ Updated: `y_meta/citation-integration-progress.md` (corrected scope and status)

Both documents are now accurate and ready for use.
