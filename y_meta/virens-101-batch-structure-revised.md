# VIRENS 101 Revised Batch Structure: Priorities Phase

**Status**: Planning document for d/f/g/i priorities

**Last Updated**: 2026-01-22

---

## Overview

This document outlines the batch structure for converting course design materials into the VIRENS 101 Obsidian vault, focusing on immediate priorities: requirements, schedule, readings, and assignments.

**Completion Strategy**: Work sequentially through batches, creating continuation context documents after each batch for handoff to next session.

---

## Batch 1F: Requirements (d_requirements/)

**Scope**: 2-3 paired notes covering prerequisites, technology requirements, and labor expectations

**Estimated Output**: 4-6 files

### Student-Facing Content Notes

1. **prerequisites-preparation-course-v101.md**
   - What students should know/be able to do before day 1
   - Academic prerequisites (placement, prior coursework if any)
   - Baseline writing/reading capabilities expected
   - Technical literacy baseline (can students open Word, save files?)
   - Transparency about course philosophy (not like typical English courses)

2. **tech-requirements-access-course-v101.md**
   - Device requirements (laptop/tablet with keyboard required, phone insufficient)
   - Microsoft Office access (free through WSU)
   - OneDrive storage (included with Office)
   - Canvas LMS access
   - Browser requirements
   - Eli Review account ($20 cost breakdown)
   - Index cards ($10-15 estimate)
   - Total cost: $30-35
   - Alternative access options (campus computer labs, library lending)

3. **time-commitment-labor-course-v101.md**
   - Class time: 150 minutes per week (6 blocks × 25 minutes)
   - Expected out-of-class time: 4-6 hours per week
   - Breakdown: Reading (2-3 hours), fragment writing (1-2 hours), assignments (1-2 hours)
   - Why process documentation takes time but compounds value
   - Transparent about workload vs. typical 3-credit course

### Justification Notes (Paired Reasons)

1. **prerequisites-preparation-reasons-v101.md**
   - Why minimal prerequisites (access/equity concerns)
   - Philosophy of meeting students where they are
   - Bartholomae "Inventing the University" — students learning academic discourse
   - How constraint sequencing supports varied preparation levels
   - Assessment approach that values growth over baseline

2. **tech-requirements-access-reasons-v101.md**
   - Rationale for each tool choice (minimal cost, institutional support)
   - Why not free-only tools (Eli Review worth the cost)
   - Access barriers and institutional responsibility
   - Tech as scaffolding vs. tech as barrier
   - How Path A design prioritizes accessibility

3. **time-commitment-labor-reasons-v101.md**
   - Composition labor made visible (Inoue's anti-racist pedagogy)
   - Why 150 minutes in-class writing time matters
   - Process documentation as labor-intensive but transferable
   - Accumulation model payoff (early labor → later capital)
   - Equity concerns about out-of-class time expectations

**Dependencies**: None (foundational batch)

**Used By**: Master schedule (time structure), weekly plans (tech rollout), assignments (prerequisite assumptions)

   - Movement-by-movement rhythm shifts:
     - M1: W-heavy (generating material)
     - M2: Balanced (reading → writing → feedback)
     - M3: W+R heavy (refining corpus)
     - M4: R-heavy (polishing for portfolio)

     - [[outcome-composing-processes#Flexible strategies]]
   - **Guidance**: One idea per card, date cards, batch transfer weekly
   - **Paired reasons**: Materiality of writing (Haas), external cognition, low-tech accessibility

3. **fragment-extraction-from-sources-course-v101.md**
   - **Context**: Reading → writing pipeline, transforming consumption to production
   - **Task**: Extract 1-2 claims from each reading as 200-300 word fragments with your analysis
   - **Standards**:
     - [[outcome-critical-thinking#Identify problems and questions]]
     - [[outcome-textual-accumulation#Generate fragments]]
     - [[outcome-workflow-technologies#Citations as collaboration]]

2. **Create continuation context** documenting:
   - Files generated
   - Issues encountered
   - Decisions made
   - What's needed next
3. **Update batch-starter.md** with lessons learned
4. **Move files** from working directory to /mnt/user-data/outputs/
5. **Present to user** for download

---

## Notes on Fragment Assignment Rationale

### Why 8 Fragment Types?

**Basic 4** (2C1) establish:
- Daily practice (freewriting)
- Capture workflow (index cards)
- Reading-writing pipeline (extraction)
- Difficulty legitimacy (questions)

**Advanced 4** (2C2) build on basics:
- Synthesis (connections)
- Feedback integration (revision fragments)
- Process visibility (dev logs)
- Corpus awareness (check-ins)

Together: Complete fragment ecology supporting accumulation model.

### Assessment Philosophy

All fragments are formative—assessed as portfolio corpus, not individually graded.

Students accumulate 40-50 fragments by Week 12, select subset for portfolio.

Portfolio grading: corpus quantity + quality + evidence of growth.
