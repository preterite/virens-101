## Content

Students completing VIRENS 101 develop capabilities as writers, thinkers, and reflective practitioners by cultivating flexible composing practices, building intellectual capital through the work of textual accumulation, and documenting their processes for metacognitive growth and knowledge transfer.

### 1. Composing Processes

Students develop flexible, iterative writing practices that treat composition as recursive, non-linear, and generative. Students will:

- Practice daily writing to build habitual engagement with invention and exploration
- Recognize iteration, disorder, and recursion as productive features of writing processes
- Generate multiple drafts and revisions as means to discover, reconsider, and refine ideas
- Employ flexible strategies for invention, drafting, revising, and editing across different writing situations
- Build a substantial corpus of textual fragments to serve as raw material for larger projects
- Understand writing-as-verb (the labor of composing iterated over time) as the foundation that produces writing-as-noun (the completed textual capital delivered to audiences)
- Reflect on composing processes to identify patterns, challenges, and growth over time

### 2. Critical Thinking

Students cultivate analytical practices that treat difficulty, resistance, and confusion as informational signals rather than obstacles to overcome. Students will:

- Identify problems, questions, and sites of complexity within texts and writing situations
- Recognize difficulty as diagnostic information that reveals assumptions, gaps in knowledge, or misalignments between intention and execution
- Read sources in multiple intentional modes to generate diverse arrays of analytical insights
- Investigate sources for information content, rhetorical context and approach, and operational characteristics
- Evaluate and synthesize diverse sources to develop positions, identify patterns of agreement and disagreement, and map scholarly conversations
- Recognize and critique relationships among language, knowledge, and power, including whose voices are centered and whose constraints are naturalized
- Use difficulty-tracking and metacognitive interruption to make reading processes visible and analyzable

### 3. Rhetorical Awareness

Students develop rhetorical awareness by negotiating purpose, audience, context, and conventions as they compose texts for different situations. Students will:

- Focus writing on specific purposes appropriate to their rhetorical situations
- Respond to the needs and expectations of different audiences
- Adopt appropriate organization, style, and mode for specific contexts
- Recognize how audience, genre, and purpose function as constraints that shape compositional possibilities (see Outcome 4: Constraint Literacy)
- Employ available composing modalities (written, visual, multimodal) to address specific rhetorical situations
- Address assignment requirements while exercising creative and strategic choices within those parameters
- Analyze how rhetorical choices affect readers' interpretations and responses

### 4. Constraint Literacy

Students practice identifying, naming, negotiating, and sequencing the constraints that shape writing processes and products. Students will:

- Identify explicit and implicit constraints operating across diverse writing situations (genre conventions, length limits, citation requirements, audience expectations, available tools)
- Recognize that constraint timing matters as much as constraint form
- Negotiate constraints strategically by accepting some limitations to free attention for creative work within boundaries
- Analyze how constraints encode power relations and uneven access to resources, genres, and rhetorical possibilities
- Apply constraint analysis to rhetorical situations, recognizing rhetorical elements (audience, purpose, genre) as constraints (see Outcome 3: Rhetorical Awareness)
- Shift constraint timing deliberately to evaluate effects on composing processes and outcomes
- Use explicit articulation of constraints to make them negotiable

### 5. Textual Accumulation

Students build substantial textual corpora that accumulate value over time, understanding the relationship between writing-as-labor and writing-as-capital. Students will:

- Practice regular low-stakes generative writing that builds a substantial corpus of revisable textual fragments
- Value rough drafts, exploratory writing, and partial ideas as potential intellectual capital to be archived and organized as resources
- Organize, tag, classify, and route fragments for future retrieval and use
- Recognize that writing-as-verb (composing labor) produces writing-as-noun (textual capital) which can be stored, retrieved, and recombined
- Remix and refactor accumulated fragments into larger, more polished compositions
- Understand that nothing is wasted—all writing has potential future value in an accumulating corpus
- Demonstrate that intellectual productivity compounds when past work informs future work

### 6. Workflow Technologies

Students develop sustainable, collaborative writing practices supported by workflow vocabularies and technologies that substitute capital for repeated labor. Students will:

- Use the six-move framework (capture, classify, route, connect, distill, publish) to name and navigate different phases of writing processes
- Employ low-tech and digital tools strategically as labor-saving technologies that enable organization, version control, and retrieval
- Organize, find, and route textual materials efficiently through directory structures, naming conventions, and classification systems
- Understand citation practices as collaboration across time, enabling distributed knowledge-making among disconnected scholars
- Provide and use productive peer feedback that identifies strengths and opportunities for revision
- Engage in collaborative and social aspects of composing, recognizing writing as work situated in communities of practice
- Transfer workflow concepts and vocabularies to writing situations beyond this course

### 7. Documentation and Metacognition

Students practice making labor and constraint visible through systematic documentation that supports reflection, analysis, and knowledge transfer. Students will:

- Maintain process documentation and workflow logs that record what was attempted, what happened, and what was learned from successes and setbacks
- Create specification documents that articulate intentions, constraints, and success criteria before and during drafting
- Develop system maps that visualize individual writing infrastructure, tools, and organizational strategies
- Document challenges, failed approaches, and recovery strategies as evidence of learning
- Recognize difficulty and breakdown as informational signals that reveal opportunities or needs for adjustment or development
- Produce evidence-based reflective writing that cites specific instances from process documentation
- Demonstrate metacognitive awareness of personal composing processes to support transfer of learning to new contexts

## Key Points

- **Seven outcomes** balance conventional expectations (Composing Processes, Critical Thinking, Rhetorical Awareness) with distinctive innovations (Constraint Literacy, Textual Accumulation, Workflow Technologies, Process Documentation)
- **Processual main statements** use verbs like "develop," "cultivate," "practice," "build" to emphasize growth over achievement
- **Achievement-oriented bullets** use verbs like "identify," "recognize," "employ," "demonstrate" to show observable capabilities
- **Cross-references** between Outcome 3 (Rhetorical Awareness) and Outcome 4 (Constraint Literacy) show conceptual connections
- **Both writing-as-verb and writing-as-noun** appear throughout, with particular emphasis in Outcomes 1, 5, and 7
- **Failure-as-diagnostic** receives two dedicated bullets in Outcome 7 while appearing implicitly in Outcome 2
- **Power and access concerns** addressed in both conventional (Outcome 2) and innovative (Outcome 4) locations
- **Six-move vocabulary** provides transferable framework in Outcome 6
- **Portfolio assessment note** demonstrates how outcomes manifest in final evaluation

## Implementation Notes

### How This Appears in Course Materials

**Syllabus**: Full outcomes appear in syllabus with brief explanatory paragraph about course philosophy

**Assignment sheets**: Each assignment references 2-3 specific outcomes in STANDARDS section, with particular bullet points cited

**Weekly schedules**: Learning objectives for each week map to specific outcome bullets

**Portfolio requirements**: Final portfolio explicitly asks students to demonstrate each outcome with evidence

**Peer review criteria**: Eli Review tasks designed around outcome-specific criteria (e.g., Outcome 6 bullets inform peer feedback prompts)

### Vocabulary Notes

- "Corpus" and "fragments" language introduced Week 1, reinforced throughout
- "Six moves" vocabulary taught explicitly Week 2, becomes shared class language
- "Writing-as-verb" and "writing-as-noun" distinction introduced Week 3, referenced in reflective assignments
- "Constraint" language begins Week 4, builds to explicit constraint sequencing discussions by Week 7

### Assessment Alignment

Each outcome maps to specific portfolio components:
- Outcomes 1, 5: Fragment corpus (quantity, quality, organization)
- Outcome 2: Source analysis work, BEAM portfolio entries
- Outcome 3: Polished final pieces showing rhetorical awareness
- Outcome 4: Constraint audit assignment, spec documents
- Outcome 6: Evidence of tool use, peer review participation
- Outcome 7: Dev logs, system maps, reflective cover letter
