## Content

Students completing VIRENS 101 develop capabilities as writers, thinkers, and knowledge workers by cultivating flexible composing practices, building intellectual capital through textual accumulation, and documenting their processes for metacognitive growth and knowledge transfer.

### 1. Composing Processes

Students develop flexible, iterative writing practices that treat composition as recursive and generative rather than linear. Composing processes are illustrated by the ability to:

- Practice daily writing to build habitual engagement with invention and exploration
- Recognize iteration, recursion, and messiness as productive features of writing processes rather than failures
- Generate multiple drafts and revisions as means to discover and reconsider ideas
- Employ flexible strategies for invention, drafting, revising, and editing across different writing situations
- Build a substantial corpus of textual fragments (40-50 pieces) that serve as raw material for larger projects
- Understand writing-as-verb (the labor of composing) as the foundation that produces writing-as-noun (textual capital)
- Reflect on composing processes to identify patterns, challenges, and growth over time

### 2. Critical Thinking and Difficulty-as-Diagnostic

Students cultivate analytical practices that treat difficulty, resistance, and confusion as informational signals rather than obstacles to overcome. Critical thinking is illustrated by the ability to:

- Identify problems, questions, and sites of complexity within texts and writing situations
- Recognize difficulty as diagnostic information that reveals assumptions, gaps in knowledge, or misalignments between intention and execution
- Read sources in multiple intentional modes (hermeneutic, deconstructive, strategic, speculative) to generate different analytical insights
- Analyze what sources *do* through the BEAM framework (Background, Exhibit, Argument, Method) rather than only extracting information
- Evaluate and synthesize multiple sources to develop positions, identify patterns of agreement and disagreement, and map scholarly conversations
- Recognize and critique relationships among language, knowledge, and power, including whose voices are centered and whose constraints are naturalized
- Use difficulty-tracking and metacognitive interruption to make the reading process visible and analyzable

### 3. Rhetorical Awareness

Students develop rhetorical awareness by negotiating purpose, audience, context, and conventions as they compose texts for different situations. Rhetorical awareness is illustrated by the ability to:

- Focus writing on clear purposes appropriate to the rhetorical situation
- Respond to the needs and expectations of different audiences
- Adopt appropriate voice, tone, style, and level of formality for specific contexts
- Recognize how audience, genre, and purpose function as constraints that shape compositional possibilities (see Outcome 4: Constraint Literacy)
- Employ available composing modalities (written, visual, multimodal) to address rhetorical situations effectively
- Address assignment requirements while exercising creative and strategic choices within those parameters
- Analyze how rhetorical choices affect readers' interpretations and responses

### 4. Constraint Literacy

Students practice identifying, naming, negotiating, and sequencing the constraints that shape writing processes and products. Constraint literacy is illustrated by the ability to:

- Identify explicit and implicit constraints operating in any writing situation (genre conventions, length limits, citation requirements, audience expectations, available tools)
- Recognize that *when* constraints arrive matters as much as *what* the constraints are, and that poorly-timed constraints can cause paralysis or incoherence
- Negotiate constraints strategically by accepting some limitations to free attention for creative work within boundaries
- Analyze how constraints encode power relations and uneven access to resources, genres, and rhetorical possibilities
- Apply constraint analysis to rhetorical situations, recognizing rhetorical elements (audience, purpose, genre) as constraints (see Outcome 3: Rhetorical Awareness)
- Shift constraint timing deliberately to test effects on composing processes and outcomes
- Use explicit articulation of constraints to make them negotiable rather than tyrannical

### 5. Textual Accumulation and Intellectual Capital

Students build substantial textual corpora that accumulate value over time, understanding the relationship between writing-as-labor and writing-as-capital. Textual accumulation is illustrated by the ability to:

- Generate daily writing that builds a corpus of 40-50 textual fragments over the semester
- Value rough drafts, exploratory writing, and partial ideas as legitimate intellectual capital rather than disposable scraps
- Organize, tag, classify, and route fragments for future retrieval and use
- Recognize that writing-as-verb (composing labor) produces writing-as-noun (textual capital) which can be stored, retrieved, and recombined
- Remix and refactor accumulated fragments into larger, more polished compositions
- Understand that nothing is wasted—all writing has potential future value in an accumulating corpus
- Demonstrate that intellectual productivity compounds when past work informs future work

### 6. Workflow Technologies and Collaboration

Students develop sustainable, collaborative writing practices supported by workflow vocabularies and technologies that substitute capital for repeated labor. Workflow literacy is illustrated by the ability to:

- Use the six-move framework (capture, classify, route, distill, connect, publish) to name and navigate different phases of writing processes
- Employ low-tech and digital tools strategically as labor-saving technologies that enable organization, version control, and retrieval
- Organize, find, and route textual materials efficiently through folder structures, naming conventions, and classification systems
- Understand citation practices as collaboration across time, enabling distributed knowledge-making among scholars separated by years or centuries
- Provide and use productive peer feedback that identifies both strengths and opportunities for revision
- Engage in collaborative and social aspects of composing, recognizing writing as work situated in communities of practice
- Transfer workflow concepts and vocabularies to writing situations beyond this course

### 7. Process Documentation and Metacognition

Students practice making invisible intellectual labor visible through systematic documentation that supports reflection, analysis, and knowledge transfer. Process documentation is illustrated by the ability to:

- Maintain workflow logs that record what was attempted, what happened, and what was learned from both successes and setbacks
- Create specification documents that articulate intentions, constraints, and success criteria before drafting
- Develop system maps that visualize personal writing infrastructure, tools, and organizational strategies
- Document challenges, failed approaches, and recovery strategies as evidence of learning rather than as failures to conceal
- Recognize difficulty and breakdown as informational signals that reveal where processes need adjustment or where understanding needs development
- Produce evidence-based reflective writing that cites specific instances from process documentation rather than offering impressionistic summaries
- Demonstrate metacognitive awareness of personal composing processes to support transfer of learning to new contexts

## Key Points

- **Seven outcomes** balance conventional expectations (Composing Processes, Critical Thinking, Rhetorical Awareness) with distinctive innovations (Constraint Literacy, Textual Accumulation, Workflow Technologies, Process Documentation)
- **Processual main statements** use verbs like "develop," "cultivate," "practice," "build" to emphasize growth over achievement
- **Achievement-oriented bullets** use verbs like "identify," "recognize," "employ," "demonstrate" to show observable capabilities
- **Cross-references** between Outcome 3 (Rhetorical Awareness) and Outcome 4 (Constraint Literacy) show conceptual connections
- **Both writing-as-verb and writing-as-noun** appear throughout, with particular emphasis in Outcomes 1, 5, and 7
- **Failure-as-diagnostic** receives two dedicated bullets in Outcome 7 while appearing implicitly in Outcome 2
- **Power and access concerns** addressed in both conventional (Outcome 2) and innovative (Outcome 4) locations
- **Six-move vocabulary** provides transferable framework in Outcome 6
- **Portfolio assessment note** demonstrates how outcomes manifest in final evaluation

## Implementation Notes

### How This Appears in Course Materials

**Syllabus**: Full outcomes appear in syllabus with brief explanatory paragraph about course philosophy

**Assignment sheets**: Each assignment references 2-3 specific outcomes in STANDARDS section, with particular bullet points cited

**Weekly schedules**: Learning objectives for each week map to specific outcome bullets

**Portfolio requirements**: Final portfolio explicitly asks students to demonstrate each outcome with evidence

**Peer review criteria**: Eli Review tasks designed around outcome-specific criteria (e.g., Outcome 6 bullets inform peer feedback prompts)

### Vocabulary Notes

- "Corpus" and "fragments" language introduced Week 1, reinforced throughout
- "Six moves" vocabulary taught explicitly Week 2, becomes shared class language
- "Writing-as-verb" and "writing-as-noun" distinction introduced Week 3, referenced in reflective assignments
- "Constraint" language begins Week 4, builds to explicit constraint sequencing discussions by Week 7

### Assessment Alignment

Each outcome maps to specific portfolio components:
- Outcomes 1, 5: Fragment corpus (quantity, quality, organization)
- Outcome 2: Source analysis work, BEAM portfolio entries
- Outcome 3: Polished final pieces showing rhetorical awareness
- Outcome 4: Constraint audit assignment, spec documents
- Outcome 6: Evidence of tool use, peer review participation
- Outcome 7: Dev logs, system maps, reflective cover letter
