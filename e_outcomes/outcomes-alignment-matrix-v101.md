# VIRENS 101 Outcomes Alignment Matrix

> [!info] Purpose
> This matrix demonstrates how VIRENS 101 learning outcomes align with national composition standards (WPA, NCTE Framework for Success) and institutional requirements (WSU UCORE, WSU Writing Program). The alignment shows that VIRENS 101 fully addresses conventional expectations while introducing pedagogical innovations.

## How to Read This Matrix

**Alignment Codes:**
- **DIR** = Direct alignment (VIRENS outcome explicitly addresses this standard)
- **IMP** = Implicit alignment (VIRENS outcome touches on this standard but not as primary focus)
- **EXC** = Exceeds standard (VIRENS outcome goes beyond what standard requires, introducing innovation)
- *(blank)* = Not directly addressed by this outcome

**Reading the Matrix:**
- Each row represents one VIRENS 101 outcome
- Columns show how that outcome aligns with each major framework's categories
- Multiple codes in a cell indicate the outcome addresses multiple aspects of that standard
- Coverage summary at bottom shows which standards receive attention across all outcomes

## Coverage Summary

This section shows which frameworks receive direct (DIR) or innovative/exceeding (EXC) attention across all VIRENS 101 outcomes.

| Framework Category | Direct Coverage Count | Exceeds/Innovates Count | Total Touchpoints | Coverage Assessment |
|-------------------|----------------------|------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **WPA: Rhetorical Knowledge** | 1 | 0 | 6 | ✓ Fully covered |
| **WPA: Critical Thinking, Reading, Composing** | 1 | 1 | 6 | ✓ Fully covered + innovation |
| **WPA: Processes** | 3 | 3 | 7 | ✓ Strongly emphasized + innovation |
| **WPA: Knowledge of Conventions** | 1 | 0 | 5 | ✓ Fully covered |
| **NCTE: Rhetorical Knowledge** | 1 | 0 | 5 | ✓ Fully covered |
| **NCTE: Critical Thinking** | 1 | 1 | 6 | ✓ Fully covered + innovation |
| **WSU UCORE: Communication** | 1 | 0 | 5 | ✓ Fully covered |
| **WSU UCORE: Critical & Creative Thinking** | 1 | 2 | 6 | ✓ Fully covered + innovation |
| **WSU UCORE: Information Literacy** | 1 | 0 | 4 | ✓ Covered |
| **WSU UCORE: Writing Requirement** | 3 | 2 | 6 | ✓ Strongly emphasized + innovation |
| **WSU WP: Rhetorical Awareness** | 1 | 0 | 5 | ✓ Fully covered |
| **WSU WP: Critical Thinking** | 1 | 2 | 6 | ✓ Fully covered + innovation |
| **WSU WP: Information Literacy** | 1 | 1 | 3 | ✓ Covered + innovation |
| **WSU WP: Composing Processes** | 3 | 3 | 7 | ✓ Strongly emphasized + innovation |
| **WSU WP: Conventions** | 1 | 0 | 4 | ✓ Fully covered |

**Overall Assessment:**
- **100% coverage** of all major categories across WPA, NCTE, WSU UCORE, and WSU Writing Program standards
- **Strong direct alignment** with process-oriented outcomes (WPA Processes, WSU Writing Requirement, WSU WP Composing Processes)
- **Innovation areas** identified in Critical Thinking (difficulty-as-diagnostic), Processes (textual accumulation, process documentation), and Information Literacy (citations as collaboration across time)
- **Conventions coverage**: Explicitly addressed in Outcome 3 (Rhetorical Awareness) as genre-specific, historically constructed guidelines rather than universal rules. This approach integrates conventions with rhetorical awareness, avoiding error-hunting pedagogy while ensuring students develop appropriate command of surface features in polished work.

## Key Findings

### Where VIRENS 101 Directly Aligns with Standards

**Composing Processes (Outcome 1, 6, 7):**
- All three major frameworks emphasize flexible, recursive composing processes
- VIRENS strongly aligns through daily writing practice, multiple drafts, reflection
- Innovation: Process documentation and textual accumulation make process visible and analyzable

**Critical Thinking (Outcome 2):**
- Strong alignment with WPA, NCTE, and WSU standards for analysis, synthesis, evaluation
- Innovation: Difficulty-as-diagnostic framework treats resistance as informational signal
- Innovation: Multiple reading modes (hermeneutic, deconstructive, strategic) operationalize critical reading

**Rhetorical Awareness (Outcome 3):**
- Direct one-to-one alignment with all frameworks
- Conventional coverage of audience, purpose, context, conventions
- Innovation: Conventions treated as rhetorical/constructed rather than universal rules
- Cross-referenced with Constraint Literacy (Outcome 4) to show constraints as rhetorical

**Knowledge of Conventions (Outcome 3, sub-bullet):**
- Direct alignment with WPA and WSU Writing Program standards
- Integrated into Rhetorical Awareness to emphasize conventions as genre-specific and constructed
- Avoids separate "error-hunting" outcome in favor of rhetorical approach to surface features
- Students demonstrate command of conventions in polished portfolio work, assessed holistically

### Where VIRENS 101 Innovates Beyond Standards

**Constraint Literacy (Outcome 4):**
- No direct equivalent in WPA, NCTE, WSU frameworks
- Extends critical thinking and rhetorical awareness by making constraint timing explicit
- Addresses power and access concerns through materialist analysis of who sets constraints

**Textual Accumulation & Intellectual Capital (Outcome 5):**
- Extends WPA/WSU emphasis on "multiple drafts" to semester-long corpus building
- Introduces labor/capital framework to composition pedagogy
- Makes value accumulation explicit rather than implicit

**Workflow Technologies & Collaboration (Outcome 6):**
- Extends WPA "collaborative and social aspects" and "variety of technologies"
- Innovation: Six-move vocabulary as transferable framework
- Innovation: Citations as collaboration across time (reframes information literacy)

**Process Documentation & Metacognition (Outcome 7):**
- Extends WPA/WSU requirement to "reflect on composing practices"
- Innovation: Evidence-based reflection using workflow logs, spec docs, system maps
- Innovation: Makes invisible intellectual labor visible and analyzable

### Implications for Assessment

**What This Matrix Reveals:**

1. **Coverage is comprehensive**: Every standard framework category receives direct or implicit attention across the seven outcomes
2. **Innovation is strategic**: New outcomes extend rather than replace conventional expectations
3. **Process emphasis is justified**: Three outcomes foreground process (1, 6, 7), aligning with all frameworks' emphasis on composing as recursive
4. **Conventions approach is defensible**: Integrated into Rhetorical Awareness with explicit framing as constructed/rhetorical rather than error-hunting

**Assessment Implementation:**

- Conventions appear in portfolio assessment as one element of holistic evaluation
- Polished portfolio pieces demonstrate command of genre-appropriate conventions
- Process documentation shows students' understanding of conventions as negotiable constraints
- No separate "conventions grade" or cut-sheet evaluation; assessed contextually

**Next Steps:**
1. Map outcomes to specific assignments (which assignments assess which outcomes?)
2. Create detailed rubrics for each outcome that include conventions within rhetorical awareness
3. Design portfolio assessment that honors both process and product, with conventions as integrated element
4. Develop Course Policies that articulate assessment structure (portfolio 50%, other components 50%)
