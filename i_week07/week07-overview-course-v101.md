## Synthesis

Two weeks ago, Meadows asked where to intervene in a system. This week completes that question: how do you know if your intervention _worked_?

Christopher Alexander spent decades studying design—buildings, towns, software patterns—and arrived at a deceptively simple framework. "Every design problem begins with an effort to achieve fitness between two entities: the form in question and its context," he writes. "The form is the solution to the problem; the context defines the problem." Your essay is a form. The assignment requirements, your audience's expectations, the conventions of the genre, the time you have to write—these are the context. Good writing isn't good in the abstract. It's good because it _fits_ its context.

But how do you assess fit? Alexander's answer is counterintuitive. You don't look for positive qualities—elegance, clarity, persuasive force—and check them off a list. Instead, you look for _misfits_: places where the form fails to satisfy contextual demands. "We take just those relations between form and context which obtrude most strongly, which demand attention most clearly, which seem most likely to go wrong," Alexander explains. "We cannot do better than this." You can't enumerate everything that makes a design good. But you can identify specific places where it fails. Revision becomes a process of finding and fixing misfits—not pursuing abstract excellence, but removing concrete problems.

This connects Alexander to Salvatori's difficulty pedagogy: difficulty is where misfit becomes visible. When readers struggle, when something doesn't land, when an argument feels forced—those are the high spots in the metal face, the ink marks that reveal where grinding is needed. Peer feedback doesn't tell you your draft is "good" or "bad." It reveals _where the misfits are_. That's information you can use.

Alexander's most provocative claim follows from this logic: "I should like to recommend that we should always expect to see the process of achieving good fit between two entities as a negative process of neutralizing the incongruities, or irritants, or forces, which cause misfit." Good fit is the _absence_ of misfit, not the presence of positive qualities. This reframes revision entirely. You're not polishing a gem. You're removing the grit that prevents contact.

But here's a necessary caveat: Alexander's negative process can tempt you into premature error-hunting. If you start grinding away at sentence-level misfits before you've established whether your argument works—before you have a workable research question, a coherent structure, a genuine purpose—you're polishing a surface that might need to be reshaped entirely. The Constraint Audit this week asks you to identify misfits, yes, but at the level of _constraints_, not commas. Is this text meeting its contextual demands? Where is it failing to fit? Those questions come before "is this sentence awkward?"

This week also shifts your peer review protocol. Cycles 1 and 2 used the Generous protocol—Summarize, Praise, Question—which asks readers to describe before judging. Cycle 3 introduces the Evaluative protocol: Describe, Evaluate, Suggest. The shift is deliberate. Alexander's framework requires evaluation: you have to assess where misfits occur, not just describe what you see. The DES protocol asks reviewers to identify specific problems (misfits) and propose solutions (suggestions for achieving better fit). This is harder than SPQ. It requires judgment. That judgment is what makes the feedback useful for revision.

The Constraint Audit you're drafting this week applies Alexander's framework to a text, process, or system you choose. Your task: identify the constraints operating on your subject, examine how those constraints shape what's possible, and evaluate where misfits occur—places where the form fails to satisfy contextual demands. A well-fitted design satisfies competing constraints simultaneously. A misfit reveals where constraints clash or where design choices didn't resolve the tensions they needed to.

Notice that Alexander and Meadows are asking complementary questions. Meadows: where in a system can you intervene effectively? Alexander: how do you know if your intervention achieved fit? Meadows gives you leverage points. Alexander gives you the test for whether you pushed the right one. Together, they form Difficulty Pair B—a framework for thinking about intervention and assessment in any system, including your own writing process.

One more concept, briefly: constraints have properties beyond their content. Some constraints are _visible_—you know they're there (word count, due date, assignment requirements). Others are _invisible_—you don't realize they're shaping your choices until something goes wrong (audience assumptions you didn't examine, genre conventions you absorbed without noticing). Some constraints are _modifiable_—you can negotiate them, work around them, reframe them. Others are _locked_—they're not going anywhere, and you have to satisfy them as given. We'll develop this framework more fully in Week 13, when you examine your own writing processes. For now, notice that the Constraint Audit asks you to surface invisible constraints and assess which ones are modifiable. That's part of how Alexander's framework becomes analytical tool rather than just descriptive vocabulary.

Blocks 5 and 6 turn to source relationships. Source genealogy asks: how do your sources relate to each other? Who cites whom? Who disagrees with whom? What conversation are they having that you're entering? BEAM categorization asks: what function does each source serve in _your_ argument? Background, Exhibit, Argument, Method—these are roles sources play, and the same source can play different roles in different projects. This work prepares you for the BEAM Portfolio in Weeks 8-11, where you'll demonstrate not just that you've read sources but that you understand how they function in scholarly conversation.

## Reading

**This Week**: [[alexander-goodness-of-fit-reading-course-v101|Alexander, "Goodness of Fit" from *Notes on the Synthesis of Form*]] (~20-25 pages)

**Key Concepts**:
- Form and context: the form is the solution; the context defines the problem
- Goodness of fit: mutual acceptability between form and context
- Misfits: specific places where form fails to satisfy contextual demands
- Negative process: achieving fit by removing misfits, not adding positive qualities
- Constraint decomposition: breaking complex problems into manageable subproblems

**Connection to Activities**: Alexander's framework directly informs the Constraint Audit—students identify constraints (context) and assess where their subject (form) fails to fit. The Evaluative peer review protocol operationalizes Alexander's methodology: finding misfits requires evaluation, not just description.

**Difficulty Pair B Completion**: This reading completes the pairing begun in Week 5 with Meadows. Theme: intervention and fit. Meadows → where to intervene (leverage points); Alexander → how to assess if intervention worked (goodness of fit). Together they provide framework for systems thinking about writing process.

**Reading Approach**: Alexander writes carefully and sometimes abstractly. The metal-grinding example (ink revealing high spots) provides concrete anchor—return to it when abstraction gets thick. Focus on the _method_ he's proposing, not just the vocabulary.

### Block Details

#### Block 1: Constraint Audit Drafting

**Type**: W

**Duration**: 25 minutes

**Materials**: Constraint Audit assignment sheet, Alexander reading notes, student's chosen subject (text/process/system)

**Opening** (3 min): Frame today's work: "You're applying Alexander's framework. Your subject is a form; its context is the constraints operating on it. Your job: identify those constraints, examine how they shape possibilities, and find where misfits occur."

Quick reminder of Constraint Audit requirements:
- Identify 3-5 significant constraints operating on your subject
- Analyze how constraints interact and shape what's possible
- Evaluate where misfits occur (form fails to fit context)
- Connect to Alexander's framework explicitly

**Main Activity** (19 min): Students draft their Constraint Audits. Circulate to:
- Check subject choice viability (is this something with identifiable constraints?)
- Ensure students are working at constraint level, not surface level
- Help students distinguish visible vs. invisible constraints
- Push toward evaluation, not just description

**Closing** (3 min): Reminder: "Draft due before Block 3 for Eli Review. This is your first Evaluative cycle—reviewers will identify misfits in your audit and suggest improvements. That's Alexander's method applied to your own work."

**Connection**: [[spec-document-constraint-audit-assignment-course-v101]]; [[outcome-constraint-literacy]]; enacts Alexander's analytical framework

---

#### Block 2: Revision Work + Eli Helpfulness Discussion

**Type**: R (touch)

**Duration**: 25 minutes

**Materials**: Student drafts, Eli Review interface reference

**Opening** (2 min): "Two tasks today: continue Constraint Audit revision, and a brief discussion about how Eli Review has been working for you."

**Main Activity Part 1** (13 min): Students revise Constraint Audits in preparation for Eli Review submission. Focus on:
- Ensuring constraints are clearly identified and named
- Checking that analysis moves beyond description to evaluation
- Verifying Alexander connection is explicit

**Eli Helpfulness Discussion** (10 min): Facilitated conversation about peer review experience so far:
- What kinds of feedback have been most useful? Least useful?
- How has the Generous protocol (SPQ) shaped what reviewers noticed?
- What do you hope reviewers will tell you about your Constraint Audit?
- Preview: Cycle 3 uses Evaluative protocol (DES)—what changes?

Frame the protocol shift: "SPQ asked reviewers to describe before judging. DES asks for evaluation—identifying problems and suggesting solutions. Alexander's framework requires this: you can't find misfits without judgment."

**Closing** (brief): Confirm submission deadline for Eli Review Cycle 3.

**Connection**: [[outcome-composing-processes]]; prepares for protocol shift; metacognitive reflection on feedback

---

#### Block 3: Eli Review Cycle 3 — Constraint Audit

**Type**: P

**Duration**: 25 minutes

**Materials**: Eli Review access, Constraint Audit drafts (submitted), Cycle 3 criteria, DES protocol reference

**Opening** (3 min): Introduce the Evaluative protocol: "This is your first DES cycle. The protocol asks you to:
- **D**escribe: What is this audit doing? What constraints does it identify?
- **E**valuate: Where does the analysis work? Where are the misfits—places where the audit fails to fit its purpose?
- **S**uggest: What specific changes would improve fit?"

Emphasize: "Evaluation isn't criticism. It's Alexander's method—finding specific places where form fails context so the writer knows what to fix."

**Main Activity** (19 min):
- Students log into Eli Review
- Complete 2 peer reviews using Evaluative (DES) protocol
- Reviews should be substantive (150+ words each)
- Focus on constraint-level analysis, not sentence-level editing

**Closing** (3 min): "Reviews due by [deadline]. Next block, you'll read feedback on your own audit and revise. The DES feedback tells you where your misfits are—that's exactly what you need to improve fit."

**Connection**: [[peer-review-cycle3-constraint-audit-criteria-course-v101]]; first application of Evaluative protocol; Alexander's methodology operationalized

---

#### Block 4: Revision Based on Feedback

**Type**: R

**Duration**: 25 minutes

**Materials**: Eli Review feedback received, Constraint Audit drafts, revision planning template

**Opening** (3 min): "You've received evaluative feedback—reviewers identified misfits in your audit. Today: process that feedback and revise. Not all feedback requires action, but all feedback is information about where your form met or missed its context."

**Main Activity** (18 min):
- Students read DES feedback on their Constraint Audits
- Identify patterns: What misfits did multiple reviewers notice?
- Categorize feedback:
  - Misfits to address (constraint-level issues)
  - Misfits to defer (surface-level issues for later polish)
  - Feedback to set aside (not useful for this revision)
- Begin revising based on prioritized feedback

**Closing** (4 min): Check-in: "What's one misfit you identified that you didn't see before? How will you fix it?" Brief sharing.

Transition: "Blocks 5 and 6 shift to source work—preparing for the BEAM Portfolio that begins next week."

**Connection**: [[outcome-composing-processes]]; revision as misfit removal; prepares final Constraint Audit submission

---

#### Block 5: Source Genealogy — Mapping How Sources Relate

**Type**: W

**Duration**: 25 minutes

**Materials**: Students' Zotero libraries, source genealogy template, Prompt 7.5 handout

**Opening** (5 min): Introduce source genealogy: "Your sources aren't isolated—they're in conversation. Who cites whom? Who responds to whom? Who disagrees? Understanding these relationships helps you enter the conversation, not just report what individuals said."

Introduce Prompt 7.5 ("Experimental Form") as available option for this block or later.

**Main Activity** (17 min): Students map relationships among their sources:
1. Select 4-6 sources from Zotero library (course readings or research sources)
2. Create a relationship map:
   - Draw connections: citation relationships, agreements, disagreements
   - Note chronology: who came first? who's responding to whom?
   - Identify clusters: which sources form a conversation?
3. Write brief notes: What conversation are these sources having? Where might you enter it?

Visual mapping encouraged (hand-drawn diagrams work fine).

**Closing** (3 min): "Source genealogy reveals that scholarship is social—ideas build on, respond to, and contest each other. When you cite a source, you're joining that conversation. BEAM categorization tomorrow helps you decide _how_ to join it."

**Connection**: Prepares for [[beam-portfolio-assignment-course-v101]]; develops [[outcome-critical-thinking]]; citation as entering conversation

---

#### Block 6: BEAM Categorization — Assigning Source Functions

**Type**: W

**Duration**: 25 minutes

**Materials**: BEAM framework handout, students' source genealogy maps, Zotero libraries

**Opening** (5 min): Introduce BEAM framework:
- **B**ackground: Sources providing context, accepted facts, general knowledge
- **E**xhibit: Sources you analyze, interpret, or examine as primary material
- **A**rgument: Sources whose claims you engage—agree, disagree, extend, complicate
- **M**ethod: Sources providing approach, framework, or methodology you adopt

Key insight: "The same source can play different roles in different projects. Meadows might be Background in one paper, Argument in another. The question is: what function does this source serve in _your_ argument?"

**Main Activity** (17 min): Students categorize their sources:
1. Review sources from genealogy map
2. Assign BEAM category to each (some sources may fit multiple categories)
3. Write 1-2 sentences explaining the function: "I'm using Alexander as [Argument] because I'm extending his misfit framework to writing process."
4. Identify gaps: Do you have sources in all four categories? What's missing?

**Closing** (3 min): "The BEAM Portfolio (Weeks 8-11) asks you to demonstrate how sources function in your thinking—not just that you read them, but that you understand how they work. Today's categorization is your starting point."

Preview: "Next week begins Movement 3: Operating at Scale. You have 20-28 fragments accumulated. Now the question becomes: how do you manage a corpus? How do you find what you need when you need it? Brooks helps us think about complexity."

**Connection**: [[beam-portfolio-assignment-course-v101]]; [[outcome-critical-thinking]]; prepares for M3 corpus management

- Movement: M2
- Available from: Week 7, Block 5
- Word count: Variable (experiment!)
- Connection: Invites students to try unconventional forms—constraint as generative. What happens when you change the formal constraints on your writing?

### Previously Released (Still Available)

- [[instructor-prompt-block1-2-technological-literacy-course-v101|Prompt 1.2: "Technological Literacy"]]
- [[instructor-prompt-block1-4-campus-observation-course-v101|Prompt 1.4: "Campus Observation"]]

- [[instructor-prompt-block6-2-pop-culture-constraints-course-v101|Prompt 6.2: "Pop Culture Constraints"]]

---

## Peer Review

### Cycle 3: Constraint Audit — First Evaluative Protocol

**Protocol**: Evaluative (DES)
- **D**escribe: What is this audit analyzing? What constraints does it identify?
- **E**valuate: Where does the analysis work well? Where are the misfits (problems, gaps, unclear reasoning)?
- **S**uggest: What specific changes would improve the audit?

**Timeline**:
- Draft due: Before Block 3
- Reviews due: [Per schedule]
- Revision: Block 4 and ongoing

**Criteria**: [[peer-review-cycle3-constraint-audit-criteria-course-v101]]

**Points**: 40 (25 reviews + 15 revision response)

**Protocol Shift Note**: This is the first Evaluative cycle. The shift from Generous (SPQ) to Evaluative (DES) is pedagogically significant:
- SPQ asks readers to _describe before judging_—builds trust, ensures understanding
- DES asks readers to _evaluate and suggest_—identifies misfits, proposes solutions
- The shift connects to Alexander: finding misfits requires judgment, not just description

Frame this explicitly in class. Students may feel uncomfortable evaluating peers' work. Remind them: "Evaluation isn't criticism. It's finding specific misfits so the writer knows what to fix. That's a gift."

## Instructor Notes

### Facilitation Tips

- **Alexander's abstraction**: The reading can feel dense. Ground discussion in the metal-grinding example (ink reveals high spots). Ask: "What's the equivalent of ink marks in peer feedback? In revision?" Answer: reader confusion, unclear passages, arguments that don't land.

- **Misfit vs. error**: Students may hear "misfit" as "mistake." Clarify: misfits are places where form fails to fit context—not necessarily errors. A perfectly grammatical sentence can be a misfit if it doesn't serve the argument. Conversely, some "errors" are irrelevant to fit.

- **Process caveat**: Emphasize the caveat in synthesis—don't grind away at surface misfits before checking structural fit. Research question before proofreading. Coherence before commas.

- **DES protocol anxiety**: Some students will be uncomfortable evaluating peers. Frame evaluation as gift: "You're helping them see misfits they couldn't see themselves. That's what Alexander says designers need—external testing that reveals high spots."

- **Permission flags preview**: Light touch only. Name visible/invisible, modifiable/locked. Don't elaborate—full treatment comes Week 13 with Process Archaeology.

- **BEAM preparation**: Blocks 5-6 are essential prep for BEAM Portfolio. Students who don't categorize sources this week will struggle with BEAM entries next week. Check engagement.

### Flexibility Points

- **Block 1 vs. Block 2**: Both support Constraint Audit. If students need more drafting time, compress Block 2 revision portion (keep Eli discussion).

- **Source genealogy format**: Visual maps, written notes, or hybrid all acceptable. The relationship-thinking matters more than the format.

- **BEAM depth**: Some students will have many sources ready to categorize; others will have few. Encourage those with few to work with course readings as practice.

### What's Locked

- **Alexander reading**: Anchors Difficulty Pair B completion. Cannot shift.
- **Eli Review Cycle 3**: First Evaluative protocol. Timing locked per schedule.
- **Protocol shift**: DES introduction must happen this week; connects to Alexander thematically.
- **M2 closing**: Fragment target 20-28 by week's end.

### Evidence to Collect

- **Constraint Audit quality**: Are students identifying genuine constraints (not just surface features)? Are they evaluating misfits (not just listing constraints)?
- **Protocol shift adaptation**: How do students respond to DES? Is feedback more actionable than SPQ feedback?
- **Pair B integration**: Do students connect Alexander to Meadows explicitly? Can they articulate the intervention → fit relationship?
- **BEAM readiness**: Are students prepared for BEAM Portfolio work? Do they understand source functions?
- **Permission flags preview**: Note student responses—are visible/invisible and modifiable/locked distinctions landing? (Data for W13 planning)
