## This Week's Place in the Course

Week 15 closes the course by completing the envelope exercise begun Week 1. Students write responses to four parallel questions, then receive their sealed envelopes back and compare what they expected with what actually happened. The gap between these documents becomes material evidence for the reflective cover letter.

The week emphasizes practical completion (what's due), reflective analysis (what changed), and celebratory recognition (what you've built). Permission flags provide the retrospective frame: tracing how students' relationships to their own work—and to academic discourse—shifted across the four movements.

**Key completions**: Envelope exercise closure, final portfolio submission, reflective cover letter, Transfer Proposal.

## Synthesis

This final week has three tasks: complete your portfolio, write your reflective cover letter, and draft a Transfer Proposal. Let's be practical about what's due, then step back to consider what the semester has produced.

**What's due**: Your final portfolio collects and presents the work you've done—fragments, major projects, process documentation. The reflective cover letter introduces the portfolio, explaining what you've included and why, what you've learned, and how you've developed as a writer. The Transfer Proposal identifies where the practices you've learned go next: what future writing situation will benefit from what you now know how to do?

Today we complete the envelope exercise. You'll write for twenty minutes responding to four questions—*before* I return your sealed envelopes from Week 1. Then I'll hand back the envelopes, you'll open them, and you'll have two documents: what you wrote fifteen weeks ago and what you wrote today. The gap between them is evidence.

**The Week 15 questions**:
1. What was the most unexpected thing you learned from this class?
2. What was the most difficult or challenging component of this semester's work?
3. Which of your unique individual skills and abilities and tendencies have benefited you most in this course?
4. Which of your projects from this class are you most satisfied with and why?

These parallel the Week 1 questions: what you hoped to learn, what you worried about, what you already knew, what you expected the work to look like. The parallels are deliberate. Each pairing creates a trajectory you can trace:

| Week 1 | Week 15 | The Gap Reveals |
|--------|---------|-----------------|
| What you hoped to learn | What surprised you | Distance between expectations and reality |
| What you worried about | What was hardest | Whether fears matched actual difficulties |
| What you already knew | What skills benefited you | What you brought vs. what you discovered |
| What you expected work to look like | What you're most satisfied with | Assumptions vs. actual production |

You might use these four gaps as a structure for your reflective cover letter—tracing each trajectory, using specific evidence from both documents. Or you might find your own structure. The parallel questions are a heuristic, not a requirement. But you now have something most reflection exercises lack: material evidence of your own change. You can hold your Week 1 thinking in one hand and your Week 15 thinking in the other. The gap isn't just conceptual; it's documented.

The envelope exercise demonstrates [[yolo-up-constrain-down-course-v101|YOLO up, constrain down]] at semester scale. Week 1 was pure YOLO: write your hopes and fears without judgment, seal them away before evaluation could arrive. Week 15 is constrain down: the semester's actual constraints—deadlines, assignments, feedback, your own growth—have done their sorting work. What you dreamed versus what you produced isn't failure; it's what constraint makes visible.

**Permission flags across the semester**: One way to understand what changed is through the permission flags you've been tracking. Early in the semester, your fragments were fully yours—readable and writable only by you, private explorations with no audience. As the semester progressed, permissions shifted. Peer review granted others read access to your work; you received feedback, responded to it, incorporated or ignored it. Submission to the instructor changed flags again—work became visible to assessment, locked in ways that earlier drafts weren't. The portfolio you're assembling now grants read access to a broader audience: the course, potentially future instructors, your future self returning to this material.

But permission flags also describe your relationship to academic discourse. Week 1, you had limited read access to scholarly conversation—sources were opaque, conventions unfamiliar, the moves unclear. By now, you've developed read access: you can analyze how sources function, recognize BEAM categories, understand what academic writing does. You've also developed write access to scholarly genres—you can produce documented inquiry, engage sources dialogically, make claims supported by evidence. The semester expanded your permissions in both directions: what you can read (understand) and what you can write (produce).

The four movements trace this expansion:

| Movement | Permission Shift |
|----------|------------------|
| M1: Surfacing | Full private write access; generating material no one else sees |
| M2: Naming | Beginning to share; peer review grants others read access |
| M3: Operating at Scale | Managing accumulated material; developing read/write access to academic discourse |
| M4: Synthesis | Selecting, polishing, publishing; work becomes fixed and visible |

Your portfolio is a snapshot of where those permissions stand now. The fragments you've selected, the projects you've polished, the process documentation you've assembled—this is what you're making visible, what you're granting read access to. It represents the current state of your accumulating corpus, not its final form. The practices continue; the portfolio captures a moment.

**Transfer Proposal**: The gap between your Week 1 expectations and your Week 15 reality reveals what you now have that you didn't have before. The Transfer Proposal asks: where does that go? What future writing situation—another course, a job, a personal project—will benefit from what you've learned?

This isn't about promising to use Zotero forever or swearing allegiance to index cards. It's about recognizing that constraint sequencing, process documentation, textual accumulation, and the six moves are transferable practices. You learned them here; they work elsewhere. The Transfer Proposal asks you to identify *where* elsewhere, and *how* you'll adapt what you've learned to new constraints.

**What you've built**: A corpus of fragments—raw material you can continue drawing on. Organizational systems that make your thinking findable. Source management skills. Peer review experience. Process documentation habits. Understanding of how constraints enable rather than just restrict. Metacognitive awareness of your own writing process. A portfolio demonstrating both product and process.

The garden you've cultivated doesn't stop growing when the semester ends. What's flourishing now needs continued tending—in new contexts, with new constraints, for new purposes. The portfolio is a snapshot of this moment. The practices are yours to keep.

## Block-by-Block Plan

### Block 1 (W): Envelope Exercise — Week 15 Writing

**Opening** (2 min): Welcome to the final week. Today we complete something we started Week 1. You're going to write for twenty minutes responding to four questions. Your sealed envelopes are still in my office—you won't see them until *after* you've finished writing.

**Main** (21 min): Timed writing (20 minutes). Respond to all four questions:

1. What was the most unexpected thing you learned from this class?
2. What was the most difficult or challenging component of this semester's work?
3. Which of your unique individual skills and abilities and tendencies have benefited you most in this course?
4. Which of your projects from this class are you most satisfied with and why?

Write as much as you can. Use the freewriting approach: keep your hand moving, don't worry about polish, answer all four questions.

**Closing** (2 min): Set your writing aside. Next block, I return the envelopes.

---

### Block 2 (W): Envelope Exercise — Return and Comparison

**Opening** (3 min): Distribute sealed envelopes from Week 1. Students open their envelopes and read what they wrote fifteen weeks ago.

**Main** (20 min): Comparison and analysis.

**Individual work** (8 min):
- Read your Week 1 responses alongside your Week 15 responses
- Mark surprises: where did your expectations match reality? Where did they diverge?
- Note the four parallel gaps (hope/surprise, worry/difficulty, knew/skills, expected/satisfied)

**Pair discussion** (6 min):
- Share one gap that surprised you with a partner
- What does the gap reveal about your trajectory this semester?

**Whole class** (6 min):
- Brief share-out: What kinds of gaps are people noticing?
- Frame: These gaps become material for your reflective cover letter

**Closing** (2 min): You now have documented evidence of your own change. Both documents are yours to keep and use.

---

### Block 3 (W): Reflective Cover Letter Drafting

**Opening** (2 min): The reflective cover letter introduces your portfolio. It should explain what you've included, why you've included it, what you've learned, and how you've developed as a writer. The envelope documents give you evidence.

**Main** (21 min): Cover letter drafting.

**Approach options**:
- Use the four W1-W15 gaps as structure (one paragraph per trajectory)
- Use the four movements as structure (what each phase taught you)
- Use permission flags as frame (how your relationship to your work changed)
- Find your own structure—but use specific evidence

**Key requirements**:
- Reference specific work from your portfolio
- Make claims about your development with evidence
- Address what you're taking forward

**Closing** (2 min): Cover letter due with final portfolio. Continue drafting next block.

---

### Block 4 (W): Portfolio Assembly and Cover Letter Continuation

**Opening** (2 min): Split your time between finalizing portfolio contents and continuing your cover letter. Both are due together.

**Main** (21 min): Independent work.

**Portfolio checklist**:
- [ ] All required components present and properly formatted
- [ ] Revisions completed on major projects
- [ ] Process documentation included (dev logs, system maps, Process Archaeology)
- [ ] Fragments selected and organized
- [ ] Cover letter drafted

**Cover letter continuation**:
- Refine claims and add evidence
- Ensure you're addressing what you've learned and where it goes

**Closing** (2 min): Transfer Proposal drafting begins next block.

---

### Block 5 (W): Transfer Proposal Drafting

**Opening** (3 min): The Transfer Proposal asks: where do these practices go next? Identify a future writing situation—another course, a job, a personal project—and explain how you'll adapt what you've learned.

**Main** (20 min): Transfer Proposal drafting.

**Guiding questions**:
- What specific practice or skill from this course will transfer? (Be concrete: not "writing skills" but "using dev logs to track my process" or "the SEAR procedure for evaluating sources")
- What future situation will benefit? (Be specific: a particular course, type of project, professional context)
- How will you adapt the practice to new constraints? (Different tools? Different timeline? Different audience?)

**Key insight**: The gap between your Week 1 expectations and Week 15 reality reveals what's transferable. What do you now have that you didn't have before?

**Closing** (2 min): Transfer Proposal due with final portfolio.

---

### Block 6 (W): Final Assembly and Submission

**Opening** (2 min): Final working block. Complete all remaining components and submit your portfolio.

**Main** (21 min): Final assembly.

**Priorities**:
1. Complete reflective cover letter
2. Complete Transfer Proposal
3. Final portfolio organization check
4. Submit

**While finishing**: Review what you've built this semester. A corpus of fragments. Organizational systems. Source management skills. Process documentation habits. A portfolio demonstrating both product and process.

**Closing** (2 min): Portfolio submission. Congratulations—you've completed VIRENS 101.

## Assignments

### Final Portfolio (Due: End of Week 15)

**Description**: Comprehensive collection of your semester's work, demonstrating both product (polished writing) and process (documentation of how you wrote).

**Required components**:
- Reflective Cover Letter
- Revised major projects (Literacy Narrative, Documented Inquiry)
- Selected fragments (your choice; curate for quality and range)
- Process documentation (dev logs, Process Archaeology)
- BEAM Portfolio or source work
- Transfer Proposal

**Assessment**: Portfolio is graded holistically on selection, revision quality, coherence, and process documentation. Individual assignment grades counted earlier; portfolio shows how you've revised, connected, and reflected.

See: [[final-portfolio-assignment-course-v101]]

---

### Reflective Cover Letter (Due: With Portfolio)

**Description**: Introduction to your portfolio explaining what you've included, why, what you've learned, and how you've developed as a writer.

**Requirements**:
- Reference specific work from your portfolio
- Make claims about your development supported by evidence
- Address what you're taking forward
- 750-1000 words

**Optional structure**: Use the four W1-W15 gaps as organizing frame (hope/surprise, worry/difficulty, knew/skills, expected/satisfied). Each gap becomes a trajectory to trace with evidence.

See: [[reflective-cover-letter-assignment-course-v101]]

---

### Transfer Proposal (Due: With Portfolio)

**Description**: Identify a future writing situation and explain how you'll adapt practices from this course to meet its constraints.

**Requirements**:
- Name a specific future context (course, job, project)
- Identify specific transferable practices (not vague "skills")
- Explain how you'll adapt to new constraints
- 400-600 words

**Connection to envelope exercise**: The gap between Week 1 expectations and Week 15 reality reveals what you now have that's transferable. Use that evidence.

See: [[transfer-proposal-assignment-course-v101]]

## Concept Connections

### Envelope Exercise: Bookend Structure

| Week 1 | Week 15 |
|--------|---------|
| Write about hopes, worries, existing knowledge, expectations | Write about surprises, difficulties, skills, satisfaction |
| Seal envelope; hand to instructor | Receive envelope; open and compare |
| First fragment (unrecognized) | Evidence for reflection |
| Beginning of corpus | Snapshot of completed corpus |

The envelope exercise creates a material artifact of change—documented evidence students can hold and compare.

### Permission Flags: Semester Arc

| Stage | Owner Permissions | Group Permissions | Others Permissions |
|-------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| M1 fragments | rwx (full access) | --- | --- |
| M2 peer review | rwx | r-- (read/comment) | --- |
| M3 development | rw- | r-- | --- |
| M4 portfolio | r-- (locked) | r-- | r-- (instructor, institution) |

Permission flags trace how students' relationships to their work changed—from fully private to selectively shared to fixed for assessment.

### Four Movements Retrospective

| Movement | Core Work | What It Taught |
|----------|-----------|----------------|
| **M1: Surfacing** | Generate fragments, build systems | Capture matters; accumulation starts here |
| **M2: Naming** | Classify, organize, begin sharing | Classification enables retrieval; feedback improves work |
| **M3: Operating at Scale** | Manage corpus, develop projects | Systems matter when volume increases; infrastructure becomes visible |
| **M4: Synthesis** | Select, polish, reflect | Curation is argument; process evidence matters |

### What You've Built

By end of Week 15, students should have:

- **Corpus**: 40-50+ fragments accumulated across semester
- **Systems**: Folder structures, naming conventions, workflow habits
- **Source skills**: Zotero, BEAM, SEAR, citation as dependency
- **Peer review experience**: Multiple Eli Review cycles
- **Process documentation**: Dev logs, system maps, Process Archaeology
- **Constraint awareness**: Understanding that limits enable rather than just restrict
- **Metacognitive habits**: Awareness of own composing processes
- **Portfolio**: Demonstration of both product and process

### Transfer: What Goes Forward

The practices transfer to future contexts:

| Practice | Transfers To |
|----------|--------------|
| Six moves (capture → publish) | Any writing project requiring research and development |
| Process documentation | Lab notebooks, project logs, professional development |
| Constraint sequencing | Strategic planning for any complex project |
| Source management | Any research-based writing |
| Peer review skills | Collaborative work in any context |

## Course Completion

After submitting your final portfolio, you've completed VIRENS 101.

The garden you've cultivated doesn't stop growing when the semester ends. What's flourishing now needs continued tending—in new contexts, with new constraints, for new purposes. The portfolio is a snapshot of this moment.

The practices are yours to keep.
