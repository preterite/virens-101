## Context: Why Reflect Now?

You've completed Movement 1 (Surfacing), where you've been discovering your writing processes and building your initial [[vocab-corpus|corpus]] of [[vocab-fragment|fragments]]. Before entering Movement 2 (Naming), take time to identify what you've learned about yourself as a writer and what patterns have emerged in your early work.

This brief reflection helps you:
- Recognize surprises and discoveries from your first three weeks
- Identify early patterns before they become invisible habits
- Set intentions for approaching M2's naming and constraint work
- Practice evidence-based reflection skills you'll use all semester

**Due**: End of Week 3 (before entering M2)

**Graded**: Yes, weighted slightly more than weekly accumulation check-ins

---

## Structured Prompts

Answer each of these four questions. Use specific evidence from your [[vocab-dev-log|development logs]], fragments, or [[weekly-accumulation-check-in-course-v101|accumulation check-ins]]. Consult the [[evidence-based-reflection-guide-course-v101|evidence-based reflection guide]] for help mining evidence and identifying patterns.

### 1. Surprises and Discoveries

**What surprised you most about your early fragments or writing process in Movement 1?**

This could be:
- Something about when/where/how you write best
- A discovery about your thinking process
- An unexpected challenge or ease with fragment writing
- A realization about your habits or patterns

Be specific: Point to particular dev log entries, specific fragments, or accumulation check-in observations.

**Example response**:  
"I was surprised to discover I write most productively in 15-minute bursts rather than long sessions. My Week 2 dev log mentions spending 2 hours on one fragment and feeling stuck, but my Week 3 entries show I produced 3 fragments using short timed sessions. Fragment #8 from Week 3 is actually stronger than Fragment #4 from Week 2 even though I spent 1/4 of the time on it."

### 2. Pattern Recognition

**What patterns emerged in your first 8-12 fragments?**

Look for patterns in:
- Topics or themes you gravitate toward
- Types of claims you make (personal experience? Analysis? Argument?)
- How you use evidence or examples
- Fragment length or structure

Use your corpus as data: count, categorize, compare.

**Example response**:  
"Of my 10 fragments, 7 focus on personal experience and only 3 engage with sources. This surprised me because I thought I was writing 'research' pieces. Looking at the pattern, I realize I'm more comfortable starting with personal narrative and need to develop source-based writing. Fragments #3, #7, and #9 (the source-based ones) all feel shorter and less confident than my personal narrative fragments."

### 3. Repeated Challenges

**Looking at your dev logs from Weeks 1-3, what's one challenge you encountered repeatedly?**

Don't just name the challenge—describe it specifically:
- When does it appear?
- What makes it difficult?
- Have you tried any strategies to address it?
- What does the pattern suggest about the challenge's source?

**Example response**:  
"My dev logs mention 'finding time to write' in 5 of 6 entries. But looking closer, the real challenge isn't lack of time—it's that I don't protect writing time from interruptions. My Week 1 and Week 2 logs mention trying to write between other tasks. Week 3, when I scheduled specific writing blocks and told roommates not to interrupt, I produced 4 fragments. The challenge is boundary-setting, not time scarcity."

### 4. Forward-Looking Intentions

**As you enter Movement 2 (Naming), what from M1 do you want to continue or change?**

Identify:
- One practice or approach to continue (what's working?)
- One adjustment to make (what needs changing?)
- How M2's focus on naming and categorizing might help or challenge you

**Example response**:  
"Continue: Timed 15-minute drafts work for me—I'll keep using them in M2.  
Change: I need more source-based fragments. In M2, when we're naming and categorizing, I'll aim for 50/50 balance between personal narrative and source analysis fragments.  
M2 anticipation: I'm curious whether naming my fragments will reveal patterns I'm not seeing yet. My accumulation check-ins mention 'unclear categories' several times."

## Synthesis Paragraph

After answering the four prompts, write one paragraph (150-250 words) in **first person** that synthesizes your M1 experience and transition to M2. 

This paragraph should:
- Draw connections across your answers to the four prompts
- Articulate your understanding of what Surfacing (M1) accomplished
- Set your intention for Naming (M2) based on M1 insights

**Example synthesis**:  
"Movement 1 taught me that my writing process works best with structure: timed drafts, protected writing blocks, clear boundaries. The surprise was discovering that constraints help rather than limit me. My 10 fragments reveal I'm strong at personal narrative but avoid source-based writing—probably because working with sources feels less comfortable. The repeated challenge in my dev logs is boundary-setting: I need to treat writing time as non-negotiable. As I enter Movement 2, I'm continuing the timed draft approach that's working while challenging myself to produce more source-based fragments. I'm curious whether M2's naming work will help me see connections I'm missing, especially since my accumulation check-ins keep mentioning 'unclear categories.' The pattern I see across M1 is that I thrive with structure but need to push myself out of comfort zones—M2's constraint work might be exactly what I need."
