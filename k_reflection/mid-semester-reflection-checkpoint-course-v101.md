## Context: Why Pause Now?

We're at the midpoint of the semester—you've completed Movement 2 (Naming) and are entering Movement 3 (Operating at Scale). This is the right time to step back and assess your first eight weeks of work before patterns become habits. 

This reflection serves two purposes:
1. **For you**: Identify what's working and what needs adjustment in your second-half approach
2. **For our Week 9 conference**: Prepare discussion points so we can address challenges and build on successes

Unlike the [[weekly-accumulation-check-in-course-v101|weekly accumulation check-ins]] which track immediate patterns, this reflection asks you to see larger patterns across the first half of the semester. And unlike the eventual [[portfolio-cover-letter-prompt-course-v101|portfolio cover letter]], this is low-stakes practice at evidence-based reflection—a chance to develop skills you'll need later for the higher-stakes portfolio cover letter.

---

## Task

Review your corpus (fragments, development logs, accumulation check-ins) and identify 3 patterns of growth and 2 areas needing development. Write 500-750 words with specific evidence from your process documentation.

**Due**: End of Week 8 or beginning of Week 9, before your individual conference

---

## Standards

Your reflection should demonstrate:
- **[[outcome-process-documentation#Workflow logs and evidence-based reflection|Evidence-based analysis]]**: Claims supported by specific references to your [[vocab-dev-log|development logs]], corpus statistics, or accumulation check-ins
- **[[outcome-composing-processes#Identify patterns and growth|Pattern recognition]]**: Ability to identify trends across multiple weeks rather than isolated incidents
- **[[outcome-textual-accumulation#Corpus awareness|Corpus awareness]]**: Understanding of your accumulated work as a system, not just individual pieces

This reflection connects to portfolio assessment because it practices the evidence-based reflection you'll need for your cover letter, as described in [[grading-assessment-content-v101#Portfolio Assessment|portfolio grading guidelines]].

## Guidance: How to Identify Patterns

### Step 1: Gather Your Corpus Statistics

Calculate these numbers from your accumulated work:

**Fragment production by time period:**
- Weeks 2-3 (M1 Surfacing): _____ fragments produced
- Weeks 4-5 (M2 Naming, first half): _____ fragments produced  
- Weeks 6-7 (M2 Naming, second half): _____ fragments produced
- Week 8 (M2 closing): _____ fragments produced
- **Total so far**: _____ fragments (target at midpoint: 20-25, per ![[_def-fragment-target-total]])

**Fragment categories/themes:**
- Count how many fragments fall into each category (if you've developed categories)
- Note: Are some topics/approaches dominating? Are others absent?

**Development log consistency:**
- Count dev log entries per week. Expected: ![[_def-dev-log-frequency]]
- Which weeks did you miss? Which weeks did you write more than required?

**Revision activity:**
- How many fragments have you revised? 
- What percentage of your corpus has been through revision? (Revised fragments / Total fragments × 100)

### Step 2: Review Your Development Logs

Reread all your dev log entries from Weeks 1-8. Look for:
- **Recurring challenges**: What difficulties appear multiple times? ("I mention time management in Week 3, Week 5, and Week 7 entries")
- **Strategy evolution**: How have your approaches changed? ("My Week 2 logs show I drafted at night; by Week 6 I shifted to morning writing")
- **Breakthrough moments**: When did something click? ("My 3/15 entry captures realizing I don't need perfect first drafts")
- **Constraint responses**: How did you react when constraints arrived? Did reactions change over time?

### Step 3: Review Your Accumulation Check-Ins

Look at your [[weekly-accumulation-check-in-course-v101|weekly accumulation check-ins]] from Weeks 2-8. What trends emerge?
- Fragment production rates: Steady, increasing, decreasing, erratic?
- Confidence levels: How has your confidence about corpus growth changed?
- Challenges mentioned: Do similar issues appear week after week?

### Step 4: Identify 3 Growth Patterns

"Growth" means positive change, development, or increasing capability. Be specific:

❌ **Vague**: "I got better at writing."  
✅ **Specific**: "My fragment production increased from 3/week (Weeks 2-4) to 5/week (Weeks 6-8). My dev logs show I developed a consistent Sunday morning writing routine starting Week 5."

❌ **Vague**: "I learned about revision."  
✅ **Specific**: "Early fragments (Weeks 2-3) rarely went through revision. Starting Week 5, 60% of new fragments get revised before I consider them complete, as my corpus shows 8 of 13 Week 5-8 fragments have 'REVISED' dates in their headers."

❌ **Vague**: "I'm more organized."  
✅ **Specific**: "My Week 3 system map shows a chaotic workflow with no clear process. By Week 7, my system map reveals I've integrated Zotero, established a consistent capture method using index cards, and scheduled two weekly writing blocks."

### Step 5: Identify 2 Areas Needing Development

Be honest about where you're struggling or not making desired progress:

❌ **Vague**: "I need to work harder."  
✅ **Specific**: "My dev logs from Weeks 6-8 consistently mention difficulty finding time to write. Fragment production dropped from 5/week to 2/week during midterms in other classes. Second half plan: protect Sunday mornings as non-negotiable writing time."

❌ **Vague**: "I should revise more."  
✅ **Specific**: "Only 4 of my 23 fragments (17%) have been revised. My dev logs show I treat fragments as 'done' immediately after drafting. Second half plan: schedule revision time one week after drafting, separate from new fragment production time."

### Step 6: Write Your Reflection

Your 500-750 word reflection should include:
1. **Brief overview** (50-75 words): Where you are at midpoint—how many fragments, general sense of your work
2. **Three growth patterns** (125-200 words each): Describe each pattern with specific evidence
3. **Two development areas** (100-150 words each): Describe each challenge with specific evidence and your plan for second half
4. **Conclusion** (50-75 words): What you'll focus on in second half

## Using This Reflection

### Preparing for Your Conference

Bring this reflection to your Week 9 conference. We'll discuss:
- Which growth patterns you want to build on
- Which challenges need instructor support vs. self-management
- Whether your second-half plans are realistic
- How M3 and M4 can support your development areas

### Looking Ahead

This reflection is practice for your eventual [[portfolio-cover-letter-prompt-course-v101|portfolio cover letter]]. You're learning to:
- Mine your process documentation for evidence
- Identify patterns across time rather than describing isolated incidents
- Make specific claims rather than vague generalizations
- Connect evidence to larger patterns of growth

These skills transfer directly to the portfolio cover letter, where you'll need to demonstrate all seven course outcomes with evidence.
