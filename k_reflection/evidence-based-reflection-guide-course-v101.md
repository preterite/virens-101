## Purpose of This Guide

This guide teaches you how to write evidence-based reflection—reflection grounded in specific examples from your process documentation rather than vague impressions. You'll use these techniques throughout the semester for:

- [[weekly-accumulation-check-in-course-v101|Weekly accumulation check-ins]]
- Movement transition reflections
- [[mid-semester-reflection-checkpoint-course-v101|Mid-semester checkpoint]]
- [[portfolio-cover-letter-prompt-course-v101|Portfolio cover letter]]

Evidence-based reflection helps you identify real patterns in your work, make your learning visible to others, and transfer writing knowledge to future contexts.

## Three Core Skills

### 1. Mining Development Logs for Evidence

Your [[vocab-dev-log|development logs]] are your primary source of reflective evidence. Here's how to extract insights from them:

**Read chronologically, mark passages that reveal:**
- Breakthroughs: "Realized today that..."
- Struggles: "Still stuck on..."
- Strategy changes: "Switched from X to Y because..."
- Process discoveries: "I work best when..."
- Constraint responses: "The requirement to... made me..."

**Example mining process:**

Let's say you're reflecting on how your composing process changed. You'd:

1. **Reread all dev logs from the relevant time period** (e.g., Weeks 2-5 for M1 reflection)

2. **Flag entries mentioning drafting, revision, or timing**

3. **Look for changes over time**:
   - Week 2 entry: "Spent 2 hours tonight trying to write fragment #3. Got stuck because I didn't know what to say."
   - Week 4 entry: "Today I tried just writing for 10 minutes without stopping. Got a messy first draft but at least have something to work with."
   - Week 5 entry: "The 10-minute drafts are working. I now write rough versions fast, then revise the next day."

4. **Cite the pattern**: "My dev logs show a shift from trying to write perfect first drafts (Week 2 entries) to using timed rough drafts followed by next-day revision (Week 5 entries)."

**What to quote vs. paraphrase:**
- **Quote** memorable phrases, breakthrough moments, or specific language: "In my 3/15 dev log, I wrote: 'Finally realized I don't need every source in every paragraph.'"
- **Paraphrase** longer passages or multiple similar entries: "My Week 3-4 dev logs consistently mention time management struggles."
- **Summarize with specifics** when citing patterns: "Between Weeks 2-6, I mentioned constraint difficulty in 8 of 12 dev log entries."

### 2. Calculating Corpus Statistics

Numbers make patterns visible. Here's what to calculate and how:

**Fragment Production Rates:**

Count your [[vocab-fragment|fragments]] by time period:

```
Week 1: 0 fragments (intro week)
Week 2: 3 fragments
Week 3: 4 fragments
Week 4: 2 fragments (midterms in other classes)
Week 5: 5 fragments
Week 6: 4 fragments

Total through Week 6: 18 fragments
Average per week (Weeks 2-6): 3.6 fragments/week
```

This reveals patterns: "My production rate dropped during Week 4 midterms but rebounded to 5 fragments in Week 5."

**Revision Rates:**

Count how many fragments you've revised:

```
Total fragments: 18
Revised at least once: 7
Revision rate: 7/18 = 39%
```

Compare early vs. late: "In Weeks 2-3, I revised 1 of 7 fragments (14%). In Weeks 5-6, I revised 6 of 9 fragments (67%)."

**Category Distribution:**

If you've tagged fragments by type or theme:

```
Personal narrative: 5 fragments (28%)
Source analysis: 7 fragments (39%)
Argument development: 4 fragments (22%)
Other: 2 fragments (11%)
```

Pattern: "Over half my corpus (67%) focuses on source analysis and argument—I'm producing less personal narrative than I thought."

**Development Log Consistency:**

Expected: ![[_def-dev-log-frequency]]

```
Weeks with complete dev logs: 5 of 6 weeks (83%)
Total dev log entries: 11 (average 1.8 per week)
Missed: Week 4 (no entries during midterms)
```

**How to Use Statistics:**

❌ **Don't just list numbers**: "I wrote 18 fragments."<br/>
✅ **Interpret patterns**: "My 18 fragments show increasing productivity (from 3/week early to 5/week by Week 5) except during Week 4 midterms."

❌ **Don't apologize for numbers**: "I only wrote 18 fragments, which isn't very good."<br/>
✅ **Analyze functionally**: "My 18 fragments represent 72% of the midpoint target (25 fragments), suggesting I need to increase production slightly in the second half."

### 3. Identifying Patterns vs. Isolated Incidents

Patterns matter; one-time events don't. Here's how to distinguish them:

**A pattern is:**
- Something that happens multiple times
- Visible across different weeks or assignments
- Consistent enough to suggest a habit or tendency

**An isolated incident is:**
- Something that happened once
- Specific to unusual circumstances
- Not representative of your typical process

**Examples:**

❌ **Isolated incident treated as pattern**: "I struggled with the Week 5 fragment, which shows I have trouble with source integration."<br/>
✅ **Pattern identified across time**: "I struggled with source integration in Weeks 3, 5, and 7 fragments (3 of 6 source-based fragments), suggesting this is a developing skill rather than a one-time difficulty."

❌ **Vague claim without evidence**: "My writing process has improved."<br/>
✅ **Pattern with specific evidence**: "My writing process has changed in three ways: (1) I now draft fragments in 10-minute sessions rather than trying to perfect each sentence (Week 4 dev logs), (2) I schedule revision time separately from drafting (system maps from Weeks 5-7), and (3) I produce 4-5 fragments weekly instead of 2-3 (corpus statistics comparing Weeks 2-3 to Weeks 5-7)."

**How to Identify Patterns:**

1. **Look for repeated language in dev logs**: If you mention "time pressure" in multiple entries, that's a pattern worth exploring.

2. **Compare statistics across time periods**: Production rates, revision rates, constraint responses that change over weeks reveal patterns.

3. **Notice what's consistent vs. what changes**: "I consistently write best in mornings (mentioned in 7 of 10 dev logs)" vs. "My revision strategies have evolved from surface editing to substantial reorganization (comparing Week 2 to Week 8 fragments)."

4. **Ask "Is this typical?"**: One late night writing session isn't a pattern. Writing most fragments late at night for three weeks straight is a pattern.

**Testing if Something is a Pattern:**

- Can you cite 3+ examples?
- Does it span multiple weeks?
- Would someone reading your dev logs independently notice it?
- Does it connect to measurable changes in your corpus?

If yes to most of these, it's a pattern worth reflecting on.

## How to Use This Guide

**During weekly accumulation check-ins:**
- Use Section 2 (calculating statistics) to track production rates
- Practice identifying small patterns week-to-week

**For movement transition reflections:**
- Use Section 1 (mining dev logs) to find evidence from the completed movement
- Use Section 2 (statistics) to compare early and late patterns within the movement
- Use Section 3 (patterns vs. incidents) to distinguish significant trends

**For mid-semester checkpoint:**
- Use all three sections to conduct comprehensive pattern analysis
- Calculate statistics for entire first half (Weeks 1-8)
- Mine dev logs for recurring themes across movements

**For portfolio cover letter:**
- Use all three sections across full semester
- Identify patterns that span multiple movements
- Calculate comprehensive corpus statistics
- Mine dev logs for evidence of all seven course outcomes

**General advice:**
- Bookmark this guide—you'll return to it often
- Start simple: early in the semester, focus on basic statistics and obvious patterns
- Build complexity: by mid-semester, you should be identifying subtle patterns and making nuanced claims
- Always ask: "Can I support this claim with specific evidence?"
