## Context: Why Reflect Now?

You've completed Movement 2 (Naming), where you've worked with constraints, categorized your fragments, and developed naming practices for your thinking. You've also completed the [[mid-semester-reflection-checkpoint-course-v101|mid-semester reflection checkpoint]], which asked you to analyze patterns across the entire first half of the semester.

This M2→M3 transition reflection is **different and lighter** than the mid-semester checkpoint. While that checkpoint looked at comprehensive patterns, this reflection focuses specifically on M2 experiences:
- How did constraint work affect your writing?
- What did naming reveal about your thinking?
- How has your composing process evolved since M1?
- What do you anticipate about "operating at scale" in M3?

**Due**: End of Week 8 (before entering M3)

**Graded**: Yes, weighted slightly more than weekly accumulation check-ins

## Structured Prompts

Answer each of these four questions. Keep responses focused on Movement 2 specifically—you already analyzed bigger patterns in the mid-semester checkpoint. Consult the [[evidence-based-reflection-guide-course-v101|evidence-based reflection guide]] for help with evidence.

### 1. Constraint Impact

**How has working with constraints in M2 affected your writing?**

M2 introduced deliberate constraints (word counts, source limits, structural requirements, etc.). Consider:
- Did constraints help or hinder your writing? In what ways?
- How did you respond when constraints first arrived vs. later in M2?
- What did constraint work teach you about your composing process?
- Point to specific fragments or dev log entries as evidence

**Example response**:  
"The two-source constraint in Week 5 initially frustrated me (dev log 5/3: 'Why only two sources? I have more to say'). But by Week 6, I realized the constraint forced me to analyze sources more deeply rather than just citing many. Fragment #18 (two-source piece) has stronger analysis than Fragment #14 (unlimited sources) even though #14 is 200 words longer. The constraint shifted my approach from breadth to depth."

### 2. Naming Insights

**What did naming and categorizing your fragments reveal about your thinking?**

M2's focus on naming means you've been categorizing, tagging, or organizing your fragments. What did you discover?
- Do your categories reveal patterns you didn't see before?
- Did fragments resist categorization in revealing ways?
- What does your corpus organization suggest about your thinking patterns?

**Example response**:  
"When I organized fragments by theme, I discovered I have 8 fragments about 'identity' but only 3 about 'technology' even though I thought I was focusing on tech issues. Looking closer, my 'identity' fragments actually connect to technology (social media, privacy, AI ethics) but I've been approaching tech through personal lens. This naming work revealed I'm more interested in human impact than technical details—which helps me understand what to write in M3."

### 3. Process Evolution

**What's one way your composing process has changed since M1?**

Compare your M1 work habits to M2 work habits. Look for changes in:
- When/where/how you write
- How you approach drafting vs. revision
- Your relationship with difficulty or struggle
- Your use of feedback or self-assessment

Use dev logs, system maps, or corpus statistics as evidence.

**Example response**:  
"In M1, I drafted and revised in the same session (dev logs from Weeks 2-3 mention 'writing all evening'). In M2, I started drafting on one day and revising 2-3 days later (system map from Week 7 shows 'draft Tuesday, revise Friday' pattern). This change happened after mid-M2 when I noticed my immediate revisions were mostly surface fixes. Separating drafting from revision lets me see bigger organizational issues. Fragment #20 went through 3 structural revisions because I waited—M1 fragments rarely got that level of rethinking."

### 4. Anticipating Scale

**As you prepare to "operate at scale" in M3, what concerns or excites you?**

M3's focus is managing larger amounts of accumulated material. Consider:
- What opportunities does having 20-25 fragments create?
- What challenges does managing that corpus present?
- What from M2 will help you work at scale?
- What new skills or strategies might you need?

**Example response**:  
"Exciting: I have 23 fragments now, which means I have enough material to find unexpected connections. My M2 naming work revealed 3 clusters I didn't anticipate, and with M3's scale work I can develop those clusters into something substantial.  
Concerning: Managing 20+ fragments is overwhelming when I try to see everything at once. I need better organization strategies—maybe color-coding or tagging systems. My dev log from Week 7 mentions 'lost track of which fragments connect to each other.'  
M2 preparation: The categorization work from M2 gives me foundation for M3 organization. I can build on those categories rather than starting from scratch."

## Synthesis Paragraph

After answering the four prompts, write one paragraph (150-250 words) in **first person** that synthesizes your M2 experience and transition to M3.

This paragraph should:
- Connect insights from your four prompt responses
- Articulate what Naming (M2) taught you about your work
- Express your approach to Operating at Scale (M3)

**Example synthesis**:  
"Movement 2 fundamentally changed how I think about constraints and organization. The constraint work showed me that limitations force deeper thinking—my two-source fragments have stronger analysis than my unlimited-source ones because I had to engage sources fully rather than surveying many superficially. The naming/categorizing work revealed patterns I hadn't noticed: I'm approaching technology through human impact rather than technical details, which clarifies what I actually want to write about. Between M1 and M2, I've developed a more sustainable process—drafting and revising on different days lets me see bigger issues rather than just fixing typos. As I enter M3, I'm excited about the connections that become visible with 23 fragments but concerned about organization. The categorization foundation from M2 will help, but I need to develop better tracking systems to see connections across fragments. M3's scale work feels like the payoff for M1-M2's accumulation: now I have enough material to discover what I'm actually thinking across multiple pieces rather than treating each fragment as isolated."
