## Design Rationale

The M2→M3 transition reflection occupies unique position in the reflection scaffolding sequence: it coincides with the comprehensive mid-semester checkpoint, requiring careful differentiation to avoid redundancy while maintaining the movement-specific reflection pattern established by M1→M2.

The design solution: keep this reflection light, focused, and movement-specific. While the mid-semester checkpoint asks for comprehensive pattern analysis (3 growth patterns, 2 development areas, 500-750 words), the M2→M3 transition focuses narrowly on Movement 2's distinctive work—constraints, naming, and preparation for scale.

This dual-reflection approach serves complementary purposes:
- **Mid-semester checkpoint**: Comprehensive analysis, conference preparation, habit assessment
- **M2→M3 transition**: Movement-specific insights, constraint literacy development, transition planning

The four prompts address M2's core pedagogical commitments: constraint literacy (how constraints affected writing), metacognitive naming (what categorization revealed), process evolution (comparing M1 to M2 habits), and preparation for scale (anticipating M3 challenges).

## Theoretical Grounding

### Constraint Literacy and Metacognition

The "constraint impact" prompt operationalizes the course's constraint sequencing philosophy. Christopher Alexander's [[@alexander1964notet]] design theory argues that constraints aren't obstacles but generative forces—they create affordances while limiting options. Students often perceive constraints negatively until reflection reveals their productive function.

The prompt asks students to notice how their response to constraints evolved: "Did you respond differently when constraints first arrived vs. later in M2?" This temporal comparison develops metacognitive awareness of adaptation—students learn they can learn to work with constraints.

The example response demonstrates sophisticated constraint literacy: the student recognizes that fewer sources forced deeper analysis, improving quality despite initial frustration. This insight transfers: in future contexts with resource limitations, the student understands constraints as potential advantages rather than only deficits.

### Naming as Epistemological Practice

The "naming insights" prompt treats categorization as knowledge-making rather than mere organization. Donella Meadows [[@meadows2008lever]]' systems thinking emphasizes that naming boundaries and relationships reveals system structure. When students categorize fragments, they're not just organizing files—they're articulating their thinking patterns.

The example response shows epistemological discovery: organizing by theme revealed that "technology" fragments were actually "identity" fragments approaching technology through human lens. This naming work clarifies the student's actual intellectual project, which may differ from their assumed project.

This metacognitive awareness—understanding what you're actually thinking about, not just what you intended to think about—supports transfer. Students who can articulate their thinking patterns can deliberately deploy or modify them in new contexts.

### Process Evolution and Comparison

The "process evolution" prompt builds on M1→M2's pattern recognition work but adds temporal comparison: "What's one way your composing process has changed since M1?" This requires students to track their own development across movements.

Kathleen Blake Yancey's [[@yancey1998refle]] research emphasizes that reflection supports learning when it connects past, present, and future. The M2→M3 prompt makes M1→M2 change visible, preparing students to notice M2→M3 changes later. This develops habit of noticing change—a transferable metacognitive skill.

The example response demonstrates process awareness: separating drafting from revision emerged from mid-M2 realization that immediate revisions were superficial. This shows reflection informing practice adjustments, which is exactly what the course aims to develop.

### Anticipatory Reflection

The "anticipating scale" prompt asks students to project forward, combining M2 insights with M3 expectations. This forward-looking reflection differs from backward-looking analysis (what happened) or present-focused description (what is).

Anticipatory reflection serves multiple functions:
1. **Preparation**: Thinking about M3 challenges before encountering them
2. **Intentionality**: Setting approach rather than reacting to circumstances
3. **Connection**: Linking M2 learning to M3 application

The example response demonstrates realistic anticipation: excitement about connections, concern about organization, recognition that M2 categorization provides M3 foundation. This isn't naive optimism or ungrounded worry but evidence-based projection.

## Implementation Approach

### Differentiation from Mid-Semester Checkpoint

The introduction explicitly names the relationship: "This M2→M3 transition reflection is different and lighter than the mid-semester checkpoint." This prevents confusion and clarifies expectations.

The differentiation strategy:
- **Scope**: Movement-specific (M2 only) vs. comprehensive (Weeks 1-8)
- **Focus**: Four targeted questions vs. open-ended pattern identification
- **Length**: Brief responses + synthesis paragraph vs. 500-750 word analysis
- **Purpose**: Movement transition vs. conference preparation

Both reflections occur around Week 8, but they serve distinct functions without significant overlap.

### Movement-Specific Prompts

Each prompt addresses M2's distinctive work rather than generic writing process:

**Constraint impact**: M2 introduced systematic constraint work<br/>
**Naming insights**: M2 emphasized categorization and naming<br/>
**Process evolution**: Compares M1 to M2 specifically<br/>
**Anticipating scale**: Prepares for M3's specific focus

This specificity prevents the reflection from becoming redundant with weekly check-ins (too general) or mid-semester checkpoint (too comprehensive).

### Continued Scaffolding

The M2→M3 reflection maintains the four-prompt-plus-synthesis structure established by M1→M2, creating consistency while advancing complexity:

M1→M2 prompts focused on discovery and initial patterns<br/>
M2→M3 prompts add constraint analysis and temporal comparison<br/>
M3→M4 prompts (forthcoming) will emphasize synthesis and transfer preparation

This progressive complexity scaffolds toward portfolio cover letter's comprehensive synthesis.

## Competing Values & Tradeoffs

### Dual Reflections vs. Assessment Load

**Tension**: Two substantial reflections at midpoint (mid-semester checkpoint + M2→M3 transition) risks overwhelming students and instructor.

**Resolution**: Keep M2→M3 transition light and movement-specific. The combined assessment load is significant but manageable, and the reflections serve complementary purposes.

**Tradeoff accepted**: Some students may resent "extra" reflection even when it's lighter. However, movement transitions establish important metacognitive pattern.

### Timing Overlap vs. Distinct Purposes

**Tension**: Both reflections occur around Week 8, potentially conflating them in students' minds.

**Resolution**: Explicit differentiation in prompt, clear explanation of distinct purposes, different structures (comprehensive vs. focused).

**Tradeoff accepted**: Some overlap is inevitable—both draw on same dev logs and corpus. However, different analytical lenses (comprehensive patterns vs. movement-specific insights) create meaningful distinction.

### Movement Specificity vs. Broader Transfer

**Tension**: Highly movement-specific prompts might not transfer beyond this course's unique structure.

**Resolution**: The underlying skills—analyzing constraint impact, recognizing how organization reveals thinking, tracking process evolution, anticipatory planning—transfer even if specific questions don't.

**Tradeoff accepted**: Students won't face "M2→M3 transition" in other contexts, but they will face moments requiring constraint analysis, pattern recognition, and forward planning.

## Evidence & Iteration

### Evidence to Collect

- [ ] **Differentiation clarity**: Do students understand how this differs from mid-semester checkpoint? Confusion suggests clearer framing needed.
- [ ] **Constraint literacy development**: Do students recognize constraints as potentially productive, or only as limitations?
- [ ] **Naming insights quality**: What do students discover through categorization? Rich discoveries suggest effective naming work in M2.
- [ ] **Process awareness**: Can students articulate specific M1→M2 changes with evidence?
- [ ] **Anticipatory accuracy**: How well do M3 anticipations match actual M3 experiences? (Assessed retrospectively)
- [ ] **Assessment load feedback**: Do students find dual reflections overwhelming or manageable?

### Revision Notes

_To be completed after first semester implementation._

Post-pilot priorities:
1. Is differentiation from mid-semester checkpoint clear enough, or do students conflate them?
2. Are movement-specific prompts appropriately focused, or too narrow?
3. Does constraint literacy prompt reveal productive insights, or do students default to complaint?
4. Is anticipatory prompt useful preparation for M3, or too speculative?
5. Should M2→M3 transition be optional given mid-semester checkpoint's comprehensiveness?
