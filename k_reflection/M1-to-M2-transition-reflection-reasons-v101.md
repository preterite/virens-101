## Design Rationale

The M1→M2 transition reflection serves as the first substantive checkpoint in the course's scaffolded reflection sequence. Positioned at Week 3—after students have accumulated enough experience (8-12 fragments, 3 weeks of dev logs) to identify patterns but early enough to adjust habits—this reflection establishes the model for evidence-based reflection that all subsequent checkpoints will follow.

This timing reflects research on habit formation: patterns established in first weeks often persist unless consciously examined. By prompting reflection at Movement 1's close, the course interrupts the tendency to let early patterns become invisible defaults.

The four-prompt structure adapts Kathleen Blake Yancey's reflective framework to first-year composition context, emphasizing:

1. **Surprises** (expectation vs. reality): Helps students notice what they assumed vs. experienced
2. **Patterns** (corpus analysis): Develops awareness of what they actually produce
3. **Challenges** (difficulty analysis): Treats struggle as diagnostic rather than shameful
4. **Intentions** (forward-looking): Connects reflection to action

The synthesis paragraph requirement pushes beyond prompt compliance toward integrated understanding—students must connect their answers into coherent self-assessment.

## Theoretical Grounding

### Yancey's Reflective Framework

Kathleen Blake Yancey's work on reflection emphasizes that productive reflection requires structure, especially for novice reflectors. Her framework asks students to consider:
- What they expected vs. what happened
- How they assess their own work
- How external evaluators might assess it
- What patterns emerged
- What those patterns suggest for future action

The M1→M2 prompts adapt this framework for Movement 1's context. "Surprises" addresses expectation vs. reality. "Pattern recognition" asks students to analyze their corpus objectively. "Repeated challenges" prompts self-assessment. "Forward-looking intentions" connects reflection to action.

This adaptation maintains Yancey's core principle—reflection must move from description ("I did X") to analysis ("I did X because Y, which suggests Z for future situations")—while making prompts concrete and movement-specific.

### Early Pattern Recognition

Nancy Sommers' research on revision and writing development shows that novice writers often establish patterns early without awareness. A student who starts by avoiding source-based writing may continue avoiding it throughout the semester unless prompted to notice the pattern.

The M1→M2 reflection's "pattern recognition" prompt makes early tendencies visible while they're still plastic. Week 3 is early enough that patterns aren't entrenched; students can adjust approaches before habits calcify.

The prompt asks students to quantify patterns ("Of my 10 fragments, 7 focus on personal experience...") because numbers make patterns undeniable. A student might feel they write "some" of each type; counting reveals 70% personal/30% source-based split.

### Difficulty as Diagnostic

The "repeated challenges" prompt operationalizes Mariolina Salvatori's concept of difficulty as epistemically productive. Rather than asking "What went well?", the prompt treats challenges as data: "What's one challenge you encountered repeatedly?"

The follow-up questions—"When does it appear? What makes it difficult? Have you tried strategies?"—push students beyond complaint toward analysis. The example response shows sophisticated analysis: the student realizes the challenge isn't "finding time" (surface diagnosis) but "boundary-setting" (deeper insight).

This reframing helps students see struggle as normal and informative rather than as personal deficit. Donald Schön's work on reflective practice emphasizes that professionals learn by analyzing difficulties, not by avoiding them.

### Forward-Looking Reflection

Anne Beaufort's transfer research emphasizes that reflection supports transfer only when it connects past experience to future action. Reflection that stops at "This is what happened" doesn't prepare students for new contexts.

The "forward-looking intentions" prompt requires students to articulate what they'll continue and what they'll change—connecting M1 insights to M2 actions. This creates explicit transfer opportunity: students aren't just understanding M1 but using that understanding to plan M2 approach.

The synthesis paragraph reinforces this by asking students to "set your intention for Naming (M2) based on M1 insights." Transfer happens when students consciously apply learning, not when they passively hope lessons will resurface.

## Implementation Approach

### Scaffolding from Evidence Guide

The M1→M2 reflection explicitly references the evidence-based reflection guide, directing students to "consult the guide for help mining evidence and identifying patterns." This creates two-layer scaffolding:

**Layer 1**: Structured prompts tell students what to reflect on  
**Layer 2**: Evidence guide tells students how to gather and analyze evidence

Students who need more support can follow the guide closely; more experienced students can adapt techniques. Both layers work together to make evidence-based reflection achievable for first-year students.

### Example Responses as Models

Each prompt includes an example response demonstrating:
- Appropriate specificity (citing dev log entries, fragment numbers, weeks)
- Evidence-based claims (pointing to corpus data, not impressions)
- Analytical depth (moving beyond description to interpretation)

These models teach by showing. Students can pattern their responses after examples while applying their own evidence and insights.

### Synthesis as Integration

The synthesis paragraph requirement serves multiple purposes:

1. **Integration**: Students must connect across prompts rather than treating each as isolated
2. **Voice development**: First-person writing encourages authentic reflection
3. **Coherence practice**: Writing one paragraph requires organizing multiple ideas into flow
4. **Assessment efficiency**: Instructor can quickly assess whether student grasps M1→M2 transition

The 150-250 word length is substantial enough to require genuine synthesis but brief enough to be manageable alongside other coursework.

### Grading and Stakes

The reflection is graded with "slightly more weight than weekly accumulation check-ins" but less than mid-semester checkpoint or portfolio letter. This positioning:
- Signals importance (required, graded, consequential)
- Allows experimentation (stakes not so high that students play it safe)
- Establishes pattern (reflection matters throughout semester, not just at portfolio)

The grading criterion is evidence-based analysis rather than correct answers. There's no "right" pattern to identify; the goal is that students identify actual patterns with evidence.

## Competing Values & Tradeoffs

### Structure vs. Authenticity

**Tension**: Four prescribed prompts might make reflection feel formulaic rather than genuine.

**Resolution**: Prompts provide structure while leaving interpretation open. Students choose which surprises to discuss, which patterns to highlight, which challenges to analyze.

**Tradeoff accepted**: Some responses will follow formula mechanically. However, structure helps struggling students participate while allowing sophisticated students to exceed structure.

### Early Timing vs. Sufficient Data

**Tension**: Week 3 is early—students have limited corpus (8-12 fragments) and brief history (3 weeks dev logs) to analyze.

**Resolution**: Limited data is appropriate for first checkpoint. Students learn pattern recognition with manageable scope before tackling semester-long patterns at midterm or in portfolio.

**Tradeoff accepted**: Patterns identified at Week 3 may not hold throughout semester. However, early reflection establishes metacognitive habit even if specific insights evolve.

### Assessment Load vs. Feedback Value

**Tension**: Adding graded reflection increases instructor workload.

**Resolution**: Brief format (four prompts + synthesis paragraph) makes assessment manageable. Rubric focuses on evidence use and pattern identification, not exhaustive feedback.

**Tradeoff accepted**: Instructor feedback will be lighter than on major assignments. However, the checkpoint's value is primarily metacognitive (student self-awareness) rather than instructor intervention.

## Evidence & Iteration

### Evidence to Collect

- [ ] **Pattern quality**: Do identified patterns meet evidence guide criteria (3+ examples, spans weeks)? Or do students describe isolated incidents?
- [ ] **Surprise types**: What do students find surprising? Patterns reveal what assumptions they brought to the course.
- [ ] **Challenge identification**: Do students identify surface challenges ("time management") or deeper issues ("boundary-setting", "comfort zone avoidance")?
- [ ] **Intention clarity**: Are forward-looking intentions specific and actionable?
- [ ] **Synthesis coherence**: Do synthesis paragraphs integrate prompts or just summarize them?
- [ ] **Evidence use**: Do students cite specific dev logs, fragments, dates? Or remain vague?

### Revision Notes

*To be completed after first semester implementation.*

Post-pilot priorities:
1. Are four prompts appropriate number, or is it too many/few for Week 3?
2. Do example responses successfully model desired specificity?
3. Is synthesis paragraph length (150-250 words) appropriate?
4. Does this reflection successfully prepare students for mid-semester checkpoint?
5. What patterns emerge across student reflections? (Reveals what M1 emphasizes/neglects)
