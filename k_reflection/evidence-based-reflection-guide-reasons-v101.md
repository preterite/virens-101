## Design Rationale

The evidence-based reflection guide addresses a persistent problem in composition pedagogy: students often equate reflection with feelings or impressions rather than analysis grounded in evidence. Left to their own devices, students produce reflections like "I think my writing improved" or "This assignment was hard"—statements that lack specificity, aren't verifiable, and don't support transfer.

This guide operationalizes Kathleen Blake Yancey's [[@yancey1998refle]] principle that reflection must be "systematic inquiry" rather than casual musing. It teaches three discrete, learnable skills:

1. **Mining development logs**: Treating accumulated process documentation as data source
2. **Calculating corpus statistics**: Quantifying patterns in textual production
3. **Identifying patterns vs. isolated incidents**: Distinguishing signal from noise

By making these skills explicit and teachable, the guide transforms reflection from mystical practice into systematic method. Students don't need to intuitively "be good at reflection"; they need concrete techniques for extracting insights from evidence.

The guide's structure as reference document rather than one-time lesson reflects its intended use: students return to it repeatedly throughout the semester, applying increasingly sophisticated analysis as their corpus and experience grow.

## Theoretical Grounding

### Composition Pedagogy: Reflection as Systematic Inquiry

Kathleen Blake Yancey's *Reflection in the Writing Classroom* (1998) establishes that effective reflection requires three elements:

1. **Constructive reflection**: Building understanding through examination of experience
2. **Systematic method**: Following deliberate procedures rather than free association
3. **Evidence-grounded claims**: Supporting assertions with specific examples

The guide operationalizes all three. Mining dev logs provides systematic method; calculating statistics generates evidence; identifying patterns constitutes constructive reflection that builds understanding.

Nancy Sommers and Laura Saltz's [[@sommers2004novid]] longitudinal research (2004) found that students who engaged in "substantive reflection"—reflection that analyzed patterns rather than merely described experiences—showed significantly more growth as writers. The key distinction: analytical reflection identifies causes, tests hypotheses, and draws transferable conclusions. Descriptive reflection only recounts what happened.

The guide's emphasis on patterns vs. isolated incidents directly addresses this finding. By teaching students to ask "Is this typical?" and "Can I cite 3+ examples?", the guide pushes toward analytical reflection that supports transfer.

### Metacognition and Evidence

Chris Anson's work on response and metacognition ("Response and the Social Construction of Error," 2000) argues that metacognitive development requires making thinking visible and analyzable. Development logs capture thinking-in-the-moment; the guide teaches how to analyze those captured moments for patterns.

This two-stage process—capture during work, analyze after—parallels Donald Schön's distinction between reflection-in-action and reflection-on-action (*The Reflective Practitioner*, 1983). The guide specifically targets reflection-on-action: stepping back from accumulated experience to identify patterns that weren't visible in the moment.

The guide's quantitative emphasis—calculating production rates, revision percentages, category distributions—reflects research showing that novice learners often lack awareness of their own behavioral patterns. Numbers make patterns visible. A student might feel they "write a lot" or "don't revise much" without data. Calculating that they've revised 6 of 30 fragments (20%) provides objective basis for reflection.

### Transfer Research: Pattern Recognition and Abstraction

Anne Beaufort's [[@beaufort2007colle]] transfer research (*College Writing and Beyond*, 2007) and the work of Kara Taczak and Liane Robertson on "Teaching for Transfer" (2016) both emphasize that transfer requires abstraction from specific instances to generalizable principles. Students must identify patterns across multiple writing situations before they can apply insights to new contexts.

The guide's structure supports this abstraction process:

**Specific evidence** (mining individual dev log entries) →  
**Pattern identification** (noticing trends across multiple entries) →  
**Generalization** (articulating transferable principles)

Example progression:
- **Specific**: "Week 5 dev log: tried 10-minute drafts"
- **Pattern**: "Weeks 5-7 dev logs show consistent use of timed drafts"
- **Generalization**: "Separating drafting from revising improves my productivity"
- **Transfer**: "This principle applies to any complex writing task—draft quickly, revise separately"

The guide teaches this progression explicitly rather than assuming students will discover it independently.

### Quantitative Literacy in Humanities Contexts

The guide integrates quantitative thinking—calculating percentages, comparing rates over time, tracking distributions—into traditionally qualitative reflection. This reflects composition's increasing recognition that students need data literacy even in humanities courses.

The statistics aren't complex (basic arithmetic), but the interpretive work matters: What does 39% revision rate mean? Is increasing from 3 to 5 fragments per week significant? Students practice interpreting numbers in context, a transferable skill applicable beyond composition.

## Implementation Approach

### Progressive Skill Building

The guide presents three skills in ascending complexity:

**1. Mining dev logs** (easiest): Requires rereading and marking passages—skills students already have from high school annotation practice. The challenge is knowing what to look for, which the guide specifies (breakthroughs, struggles, strategy changes).

**2. Calculating statistics** (medium): Requires basic arithmetic and organizational thinking—counting fragments by week, calculating percentages. The challenge is knowing what numbers matter and how to interpret them.

**3. Identifying patterns** (hardest): Requires analytical thinking—distinguishing patterns from incidents, testing whether something is typical, connecting evidence across time. The challenge is developing judgment about what constitutes a pattern.

This progression means students can successfully use the guide early (focusing on mining and basic statistics) while growing into sophisticated pattern identification by semester's end.

### Reference Document Structure

The guide is designed for repeated consultation, not one-time reading:

**Three numbered sections** correspond to three discrete skills, making it easy to say "Use Section 2 to calculate your statistics" in assignment prompts.

**Examples throughout** model both correct and incorrect approaches, teaching by contrast.

**"How to Use This Guide" section** explicitly tells students when to apply which skills, preventing the guide from becoming abstract reference they never consult.

**Multiple entry points** mean students at different skill levels find useful starting places—a struggling student can focus on basic statistics while an advanced student practices nuanced pattern identification.

### Concrete Techniques Over Abstract Principles

Rather than saying "reflect thoughtfully" or "provide evidence," the guide specifies exact procedures:

- "Reread all dev logs from the relevant time period"
- "Flag entries mentioning drafting, revision, or timing"
- "Look for changes over time"
- "Count how many fragments you've revised"
- "Compare early vs. late"

This procedural specificity serves novice learners who need concrete steps, while more experienced students can adapt procedures to their needs.

### Integration with Process Documentation

The guide depends on students having maintained development logs and accumulated fragments throughout the semester. This creates positive feedback loop: students who keep consistent dev logs have richer evidence for reflection, which makes reflection more rewarding, which motivates continued documentation.

The guide also makes explicit the purpose of process documentation: it's not busywork but evidence source for reflection that supports transfer. This purposefulness helps students understand why documentation matters.

## Competing Values & Tradeoffs

### Systematic Method vs. Authentic Reflection

**Tension**: Teaching step-by-step procedures might make reflection feel mechanical rather than genuine.

**Resolution**: The guide provides structure for students who need it while allowing flexibility for those who don't. Advanced students can use the techniques selectively; struggling students can follow procedures closely.

**Tradeoff accepted**: Some reflection may initially feel formulaic. However, research shows novice reflectors need structure before they can meaningfully self-direct. The formula is training wheels, not permanent constraint.

### Quantitative Emphasis vs. Qualitative Depth

**Tension**: Calculating statistics might encourage numerical thinking over interpretive depth.

**Resolution**: The guide emphasizes that numbers must be interpreted: "Don't just list numbers... Interpret patterns." Statistics are evidence, not conclusions.

**Tradeoff accepted**: Some students may overvalue numbers ("I wrote 18 fragments so I'm doing well") without deeper analysis. Teaching needs to reinforce that interpretation matters more than counts.

### Specificity vs. Transferability

**Tension**: Very specific techniques (mining dev logs, calculating fragment rates) might not transfer to non-composition contexts.

**Resolution**: The underlying skills—examining evidence systematically, identifying patterns in behavior, distinguishing signal from noise—transfer broadly even if specific procedures don't. A student who learns to mine dev logs for patterns can mine email archives, project logs, or meeting notes using similar methods.

**Tradeoff accepted**: Transfer isn't automatic. Students need help recognizing how these techniques apply beyond English 101.

### Reference vs. Instruction

**Tension**: As reference guide, this isn't formally "taught" in a lesson. Students might not engage with it without explicit instruction.

**Resolution**: Every reflection assignment explicitly references relevant sections: "Use Section 2 to calculate statistics." This forces engagement. Additionally, instructor can do brief in-class workshops demonstrating techniques.

**Tradeoff accepted**: Students who don't read carefully might miss the guide. However, repeated references throughout semester create multiple entry points.

## Evidence & Iteration

### Evidence to Collect

- [ ] **Student usage**: Do students cite the guide when reflecting? Do they reference specific sections?
- [ ] **Skill progression**: Compare early reflections (likely more descriptive) to late reflections (ideally more analytical). Do students show growth in evidence-based reflection?
- [ ] **Section effectiveness**: Which sections do students use most? Which seem ignored?
- [ ] **Statistical accuracy**: Do students calculate statistics correctly? Common errors suggest where guide needs clarification.
- [ ] **Pattern quality**: Do identified patterns meet criteria (3+ examples, spans weeks, measurable)? Or do students still treat isolated incidents as patterns?
- [ ] **Transfer evidence**: Do students apply these techniques to other courses or contexts? Survey or interview data.

### Revision Notes

*To be completed after first semester implementation.*

Post-pilot priorities:
1. Which techniques require most instructor support? (Suggests guide needs expansion or clarification)
2. Do students find the quantitative emphasis useful or burdensome?
3. Is three-skill structure intuitive, or do students need different organization?
4. Should the guide include worked examples of complete reflections showing all three skills integrated?
5. Does the "How to Use This Guide" section successfully direct students to appropriate sections for each assignment?
