## Design Rationale

### Why This Reading

Bernstein provides crucial reframing of revision from error-correction to meaning-making. Many students enter composition courses believing revision means "fix the mistakes" or "make it sound better"—surface-level changes that don't engage conceptual development. Bernstein's argument that revision *creates* meaning through transformation validates the course's intensive revision emphasis and justifies preserving "failed" experiments and abandoned drafts.

This reading is especially important for countering deficit narratives about revision: students who revise extensively aren't "bad writers who can't get it right the first time"—they're engaging in the generative labor where meaning actually gets made. Bernstein (a poet, not a composition scholar) offers an outside perspective that can reach students who dismiss pedagogical theory as "teacher talk."

### Why Week 6 Placement

Week 6 falls in mid-Movement 2 (Naming), when students are actively revising through structured peer review (Eli Review) and working with sources. By this point, students have experienced substantive revision—not just surface editing—and likely feel frustrated by how labor-intensive it is. Bernstein arrives precisely when students need intellectual validation for the difficult work they're doing.

This placement follows constraint sequencing: students need to *experience* revision as demanding cognitive labor before they'll appreciate Bernstein's claim that this labor is where meaning emerges. Week 6 is far enough into revision cycles that students have something to reflect on, but early enough that reframing revision's purpose can shape subsequent work.

## Theoretical Grounding

### Composition Pedagogy

Bernstein's essay connects to foundational process pedagogy (Murray, Elbow, Sommers) that treats revision as central to composing rather than cleanup after drafting. Nancy Sommers's research showing that experienced writers revise for meaning while novices revise for surface features directly supports Bernstein's argument.

The concept of **writing-as-verb vs. writing-as-noun**—labor vs. product, process vs. capital—is central to Bernstein's analysis. His emphasis on the "cutting room floor" (discarded material) makes visible the labor that product-focused assessment ignores. This connects to feminist composition scholarship (Kirsch, Ritchie) that values affective and invisible labor in writing.

Bernstein's poetry background brings **Language Poetry** principles into composition: meaning emerges through material manipulation of language, not from expressing pre-formed thoughts. This complements Ong's technology frame: if writing restructures consciousness, then revision (restructuring writing) is consciousness-restructuring work.

### Systems/Design Thinking

Bernstein's analysis parallels systems thinking about **iterative development** and **failure as information**:

- **Cutting as constraint application**: What gets cut reveals what constraints matter most—genre expectations, audience needs, clarity demands. This maps onto Alexander's constraint decomposition.

- **Failed experiments as valuable**: Software development treats failed tests/prototypes as informational. Bernstein treats abandoned drafts similarly—they reveal what doesn't work, which guides what might work.

- **Process archaeology**: Bernstein's emphasis on preserving cutting room floor material anticipates the course's Process Archaeology assignment. In software, this is version control history; in design, it's design journals. All make process visible for analysis.

## Implementation Approach

### How Students Engage

Students read Bernstein's essay (~15 pages) during Week 6, mid-Movement 2. The guiding questions ask them to:

1. Identify moments when revision changed their thinking, not just clarified it
2. Consider why preserving "failed" work might be valuable
3. Connect revision labor to the course's labor/capital distinction

These questions operationalize Bernstein's poetic insights for students' own practices. Rather than treating poetry composition as exotic, students test Bernstein's claims against their revision experiences.

### Connection to Course Activities

Week 6 activities include:
- Active peer review cycles through Eli Review
- Source integration practice (transforming sources into arguments)
- Dev log entries documenting revision decisions

Bernstein provides vocabulary for metacognitive reflection on these activities: students can articulate *why* cutting a paragraph was difficult (it represented invested labor) and *what* that difficulty revealed (attachment to initial conception rather than discovered meaning).

### Ongoing Application

Bernstein's framework recurs throughout the semester:
- **Movement 3** (Scale): When consolidating corpus, students practice "ruthless cutting" informed by Bernstein's principles
- **Movement 4** (Synthesis): Process Archaeology explicitly asks students to examine their "cutting room floor"—what got abandoned and why
- **Final Portfolio**: Students decide what to include/exclude, consciously curating their accumulated material

## Competing Values & Tradeoffs

### What This Reading Offers

- **Reframes struggle**: Revision difficulty becomes evidence of meaning-making, not inadequacy
- **Non-pedagogical voice**: Bernstein writes as practitioner, not teacher; may reach students differently
- **Concrete metaphor**: "Blood on the cutting room floor" gives visceral language for revision's emotional labor

### Potential Challenges

- **Poetry context**: Students may resist insights from poetry as irrelevant to their writing
- **Dense prose**: Bernstein writes for literary audience; some passages are conceptually demanding
- **Counterintuitive claim**: "Failed" experiments are valuable contradicts students' prior schooling

### How Design Mitigates Challenges

The course note explicitly bridges poetry and all writing: "Bernstein writes about poetry composition, but his insights... apply to all writing." Guiding questions focus on students' own revision experiences, not poetry analysis. Week 6 timing ensures students have revision experiences that validate Bernstein's claims.

The first guiding question frames revision as discovery rather than correction, helping students recognize they've already experienced what Bernstein describes. This reduces resistance by connecting abstract theory to lived experience.

## Evidence & Iteration

### Evidence to Collect

- [ ] Do students describe revision in transformative terms (meaning-making) rather than corrective terms (fixing)?
- [ ] In dev logs, do students reflect on *why* they cut/changed material, not just *what* changed?
- [ ] Do students demonstrate valuing process (labor) alongside product (capital) in reflections?
- [ ] In Process Archaeology, do students engage meaningfully with their "cutting room floor"?

### Revision Notes

If poetry context creates resistance: consider adding a companion piece from expository writing (e.g., George Orwell's "Why I Write" on revision) to show principles apply across genres.

If timing feels late: could move to Week 5, but risk students not having enough revision experience to ground concepts.
