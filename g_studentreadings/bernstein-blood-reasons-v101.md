## Design Rationale

### Why This Reading

Charles Bernstein provides crucial reframing of revision from error-correction to meaning-making. Many students enter composition courses believing revision means "fix the mistakes" or "make it sound better"—surface-level changes that don't engage conceptual development. Bernstein's argument that revision _creates_ meaning through transformation validates the course's intensive revision emphasis and justifies preserving "failed" experiments and abandoned drafts.

This reading is especially important for countering deficit narratives about revision: students who revise extensively aren't "bad writers who can't get it right the first time"—they're engaging in the generative labor where meaning actually gets made. Bernstein (a poet, not a composition scholar) offers an outside perspective that can reach students who dismiss pedagogical theory as "teacher talk."

### Why Week 13 Placement

Week 13 falls in Movement 4 (Synthesis), when students are completing Process Archaeology and assembling their final portfolios. By this point, students have accumulated an entire semester's worth of writing—fragments, drafts, experiments, failed attempts—and must decide what to include, what to exclude, and how to frame what they've learned. Bernstein arrives precisely when students need intellectual validation for the curation work they're doing: choosing what belongs in the portfolio and what stays in the archive.

This placement follows constraint sequencing: students need to _experience_ the difficulty of curating accumulated work before they'll appreciate Bernstein's claim that the "cutting room floor" is intellectually valuable. Week 13 is late enough that students have substantial material to curate, but early enough that reframing curation as meaning-making (not just selection) can shape portfolio assembly. The reading transforms what might feel like mechanical sorting into conscious rhetorical decision-making about what their semester's work means.

## Theoretical Grounding

### Composition Pedagogy

Bernstein's essay connects to foundational process pedagogy (Murray [[@murray1972teach]], Elbow [[@elbow1973writi]], Sommers) that treats revision as central to composing rather than cleanup after drafting. Nancy Sommers's research showing that experienced writers revise for meaning while novices revise for surface features directly supports Bernstein's argument.

The concept of **writing-as-verb vs. writing-as-noun**—labor vs. product, process vs. capital—is central to Bernstein's analysis. His emphasis on the "cutting room floor" (discarded material) makes visible the labor that product-focused assessment ignores. This connects to feminist composition scholarship (Kirsch, Ritchie) that values affective and invisible labor in writing.

Bernstein's poetry background brings **Language Poetry** principles into composition: meaning emerges through material manipulation of language, not from expressing pre-formed thoughts. This complements Ong's [[@ong2012writi]] technology frame: if writing restructures consciousness, then revision (restructuring writing) is consciousness-restructuring work.

### Systems/Design Thinking

Bernstein's analysis parallels systems thinking about **iterative development** and **failure as information**:

- **Cutting as constraint application**: What gets cut reveals what constraints matter most—genre expectations, audience needs, clarity demands. This maps onto Alexander's [[@alexander1964notet]] constraint decomposition.

- **Failed experiments as valuable**: Software development treats failed tests/prototypes as informational. Bernstein treats abandoned drafts similarly—they reveal what doesn't work, which guides what might work.

- **Process archaeology**: Bernstein's emphasis on preserving cutting room floor material anticipates the course's Process Archaeology assignment. In software, this is version control history; in design, it's design journals. All make process visible for analysis.

## Implementation Approach

### How Students Engage

Students read Bernstein's essay (~15 pages) during Week 13, late Movement 4. The guiding questions ask them to:

1. Examine how curation decisions (what to include/exclude from portfolio) reveal meaning
2. Consider why documenting their "cutting room floor" matters for Process Archaeology
3. Connect permission flags and portfolio curation to intellectual work

These questions operationalize Bernstein's poetic insights for students' portfolio assembly work. Rather than treating poetry composition as exotic, students test Bernstein's claims against their curation experiences.

### Connection to Course Activities

Week 13 activities include:
- Completing Process Archaeology (documenting failed experiments, abandoned directions)
- Final portfolio assembly (deciding what to include from semester's accumulated work)
- Permission flag decisions (what gets published, what stays private, what gets acknowledged)

Bernstein provides vocabulary for metacognitive reflection on these activities: students can articulate _why_ excluding a fragment was difficult (it represented invested labor) and _what_ that difficulty revealed (evolution of thinking, recognition that some experiments needed to fail for others to succeed).

### Ongoing Application

Bernstein's framework is crucial for final portfolio work:
- **Permission flags**: Students decide what gets published (in portfolio), what stays private (in archive), what gets acknowledged but not shown (in Process Archaeology). Bernstein validates these as meaning-making decisions.
- **Process Archaeology**: Explicitly asks students to examine their "cutting room floor"—what got abandoned and why. Bernstein provides language for articulating why failed experiments matter.
- **Portfolio cover letter**: Students can use Bernstein's framework to explain curation choices—what they included, excluded, and what those decisions reveal about their development.

## Competing Values & Tradeoffs

### What This Reading Offers

- **Reframes struggle**: Revision difficulty becomes evidence of meaning-making, not inadequacy
- **Non-pedagogical voice**: Bernstein writes as practitioner, not teacher; may reach students differently
- **Concrete metaphor**: "Blood on the cutting room floor" gives visceral language for revision's emotional labor

### Potential Challenges

- **Poetry context**: Students may resist insights from poetry as irrelevant to their writing
- **Dense prose**: Bernstein writes for literary audience; some passages are conceptually demanding
- **Counterintuitive claim**: "Failed" experiments are valuable contradicts students' prior schooling

### How Design Mitigates Challenges

The course note explicitly bridges poetry and all writing: "Bernstein writes about poetry composition, but his insights... apply to all writing." Guiding questions focus on students' own revision experiences, not poetry analysis. Week 13 timing ensures students have a full semester of revision experiences that validate Bernstein's claims.

The first guiding question frames revision as discovery rather than correction, helping students recognize they've already experienced what Bernstein describes. This reduces resistance by connecting abstract theory to lived experience.

## Evidence & Iteration

### Evidence to Collect

- [ ] Do students describe revision in transformative terms (meaning-making) rather than corrective terms (fixing)?
- [ ] In dev logs, do students reflect on _why_ they cut/changed material, not just _what_ changed?
- [ ] Do students demonstrate valuing process (labor) alongside product (capital) in reflections?
- [ ] In Process Archaeology, do students engage meaningfully with their "cutting room floor"?

### Revision Notes

If poetry context creates resistance: consider adding a companion piece from expository writing (e.g., George Orwell's "Why I Write" on revision) to show principles apply across genres.

If timing feels late: the W13 placement is intentional—students need full semester of accumulated work to understand curation decisions as meaning-making. Earlier placement would make Bernstein's concepts abstract rather than immediately applicable.
