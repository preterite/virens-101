## Design Rationale

### Why This Reading

Alexander [[@alexander1964notet]] provides the theoretical foundation for the course's distinctive approach to constraints: _constraint sequencing_ (when constraints arrive matters as much as what they are) and _constraints as enabling_ (constraints provide information about fit, not just limitations). Without Alexander's framework, students may experience constraints as arbitrary teacher requirements. With it, they understand constraints as design specifications that enable fit between text and context.

This reading is crucial for reframing how students relate to writing requirements. Traditional pedagogy often presents constraints as obstacles (overcome them) or rules (follow them). Alexander presents constraints as information (they tell you what context requires). This shift enables strategic engagement: analyze constraints to understand fit requirements, then design form to meet context.

### Why Week 7 Placement

Week 7 falls at the end of Movement 2 (Naming), when students are actively working with multiple constraint systems: peer review criteria, source integration requirements, BEAM categorization, word limits, citation formats. They're experiencing constraint complexity and potential conflicts. Alexander arrives precisely when students need conceptual tools for managing competing constraints—and when the Constraint Audit assignment demands systematic constraint analysis.

This placement follows constraint sequencing: students must _experience_ constraint management challenges before Alexander's framework makes sense. Week 7 provides enough accumulated constraint experience (7 weeks of assignments, peer review, source work) that "misfits" and "constraint relationships" land on concrete examples rather than remaining abstract.

### Difficulty Pair A (with Salvatori)

Alexander is one half of **Difficulty Pair A** (Salvatori [[@salvatori1996conve]] + Alexander, "Failure as Diagnostic"). Students encounter both readings within a 4-week span:

- **Salvatori (Week 3)**: Difficulty makes reading processes visible—what's hard reveals where cognitive work is happening
- **Alexander (Week 7)**: Misfit makes design problems visible—where form fails context reveals where improvement is needed

The thematic connection: both treat **the moment something goes wrong as the moment real learning begins**. Salvatori asks what difficulty reveals about reading; Alexander asks what misfit reveals about design. The 4-week gap allows students to develop Salvatori's difficulty-as-diagnostic practice before Alexander gives them a systematic method for locating and resolving misfits during the Constraint Audit assignment.

## Theoretical Grounding

### Composition Pedagogy

Alexander connects to **rhetorical situation theory** (Bitzer [[@bitzer1968rheto]], Bain, Miller [[@miller1984genrf]]): rhetorical constraints (audience expectations, genre conventions, exigence) parallel Alexander's design constraints (contextual requirements). Both traditions emphasize that form should fit context, and "good writing" is context-dependent—what fits one situation misfits another.

The **misfit** concept parallels Salvatori's [[@salvatori1996conve]] **difficulty**: both treat problems as informational rather than deficient. When writing doesn't work (misfit) or reading is hard (difficulty), these moments reveal what's complex or what fit requires. Alexander's approach makes difficulty actionable: identify specific misfits, resolve them systematically.

**Process pedagogy** traditionally emphasizes revision, but often vaguely ("make it better"). Alexander operationalizes revision: identify misfits (where form and context don't match), prioritize which to address, understand how changes affect other constraints. This makes revision strategic rather than intuitive.

### Systems/Design Thinking

Alexander's _Notes on the Synthesis of Form_ (1964) is foundational in design theory, architecture, and software engineering. Key concepts:

- **Fit as design goal**: Good design = good fit between form and context. This is relational (context-dependent) not absolute. Parallels Norman's [[@norman2013desig]] situated action: design quality depends on use context.

- **Misfits reveal requirements**: Don't ask "what's good design?"—ask "what's wrong with current design?" Misfits are concrete, observable, analyzable. This parallels Salvatori's difficulty and Brooks's [[@brooks1986silve]] accidental complexity: problems are informational.

- **Constraint decomposition**: Complex problems have interconnected constraints. Alexander's method: decompose into sub-problems, identify constraint relationships, resolve systematically. This influenced software design patterns (Gang of Four) and modular programming.

- **Iterative resolution**: Addressing one misfit may create others (side effects). Design is iterative: resolve misfits, check for new misfits, iterate. Parallels Schön's reflection-in-action and agile development.

## Implementation Approach

### How Students Engage

Students read Alexander's Chapter 2 (~20-25 pages) during Week 7, at the end of Movement 2. The guiding questions ask them to:

1. Identify specific misfits in their recent writing (diagnostic application)
2. Map constraint relationships (understanding interconnection)
3. Recognize context-dependence of form (fit framework)

These questions operationalize Alexander's concepts by applying them to students' ongoing work. Rather than learning architecture theory, students use Alexander as analytical tool for their writing challenges.

### Connection to Course Activities

Week 7 activities include:
- Active peer review (identifying misfits in others' drafts)
- Source integration work (fitting quotations to arguments)
- Constraint Audit drafting (documenting constraint systems)

Alexander provides intellectual framework for these activities: peer review becomes misfit identification—not "what's wrong?" but "where does form not fit context?" Source integration requires understanding constraint relationships: supporting claims (strengthens argument) while maintaining voice (preserves coherence) within word limits (satisfies assignment).

### Ongoing Application

Alexander's framework recurs throughout the semester:

- **Movement 2**: Constraint Audit assignment (end of M2) explicitly asks students to identify and analyze constraints—operationalizing Alexander's approach
- **Movement 3**: Corpus management requires understanding how organizational constraints (folder structure, naming conventions, tags) enable or impede retrieval
- **Movement 4**: Portfolio assembly involves deliberate constraint management: fitting accumulated material (form) to portfolio requirements (context)

Process Archaeology asks students to document how their understanding of constraints evolved—exactly parallel to Alexander's iterative misfit resolution.

## Competing Values & Tradeoffs

### What This Reading Offers

- **Reframes constraints**: From obstacles to information about fit requirements
- **Strategic revision**: Provides method for identifying and resolving problems systematically
- **Interconnected thinking**: Reveals how changes cascade through constraint networks

### Potential Challenges

- **Architecture context**: Examples from building design may feel distant from writing
- **Abstract concepts**: Fit, misfit, constraint decomposition require conceptual translation
- **Demanding read**: Alexander writes for design professionals; density and length challenging

### How Design Mitigates Challenges

The course note explicitly translates architecture to writing: "argument too complex for audience, evidence insufficient for claim, organization unclear for purpose" as concrete writing misfits. Guiding questions focus entirely on writing examples, making Alexander immediately applicable.

Week 7 timing provides maximum experiential grounding: students have 7 weeks of constraint management to analyze. Alexander's abstractions land on lived experience: "constraint relationships" maps onto real tradeoffs students have navigated (evidence vs. length, complexity vs. clarity).

The first guiding question normalizes struggling: "something felt wrong"—everyone experiences misfits. Alexander validates this experience while providing analytical tools: naming specific misfits enables strategic response rather than vague anxiety.

## Evidence & Iteration

### Evidence to Collect

- [ ] Do students use fit/misfit vocabulary in peer review, dev logs, and reflections?
- [ ] Can students identify specific constraint relationships (not just list constraints)?
- [ ] Do students demonstrate understanding that "good writing" is context-dependent (fit-based)?
- [ ] In Process Archaeology, do students reflect on evolving constraint understanding?

### Revision Notes

If architecture context creates barriers: consider supplementing with writing-specific examples of constraint management before reading Alexander, or excerpting most relevant sections on misfits and constraint relationships.

If concepts feel too abstract: develop Week 7 activity where students collaboratively identify misfits in sample writing before reading Alexander to recognize they already do this analysis intuitively.

If length is prohibitive: could assign Chapter 2 only (shortest, most accessible chapter) or excerpt key sections on misfits (pages 15-25 approximately).
