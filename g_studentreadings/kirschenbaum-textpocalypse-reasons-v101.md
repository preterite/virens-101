## Design Rationale

### Why This Reading

Kirschenbaum provides crucial theoretical grounding for the course's emphasis on file management, folder structure, and documentation practices—elements that might otherwise seem like housekeeping rather than intellectual work. By making visible the material conditions of digital writing (file formats, storage media, software dependencies), Kirschenbaum demonstrates that *how* we organize and preserve writing is inseparable from *what* that writing means and can do.

This reading is essential for justifying the course's tech stack choices (plain text where possible, consistent naming conventions, organized folders, redundant storage). Without Kirschenbaum's framework, students may experience these requirements as arbitrary bureaucracy. With it, they understand tool and organization choices as consequential decisions about textual survival and accessibility.

### Why Week 4 Placement

Week 4 marks the beginning of Movement 2 (Naming), when students transition from expansive fragment generation to classification and organization. Students have 3 weeks of accumulated writing and now face the practical challenge: how do I find things? How do I keep track of what I've written? Kirschenbaum arrives precisely when file management stops being abstract and becomes urgent.

This placement follows constraint sequencing: students need to *experience* the problem (too many files, can't find things, losing track of versions) before they'll understand why systematic organization matters. Week 4 is early enough that disorganization hasn't become catastrophic, but late enough that students have felt friction in managing their writing.

## Theoretical Grounding

### Composition Pedagogy

Kirschenbaum extends Ong's writing-as-technology insight into the digital realm. Where Ong focused on oral/literate transitions, Kirschenbaum examines print/digital transitions and the instability this creates. His work connects to **material hermeneutics** in composition studies—the idea that textual meaning is inseparable from material form (McGann, Hayles).

The concept of **"textual condition"** (Jerome McGann) underlies Kirschenbaum's analysis: texts don't exist as abstract meanings but as physical/digital artifacts with material constraints. This validates the course's attention to mundane matters (file formats, folder structures, naming conventions) as intellectually significant.

Kirschenbaum's work supports the course outcome on **composing processes** by making visible that "process" includes infrastructure: how files are stored, organized, backed up, versioned. Traditional process pedagogy (drafting, revision, editing) often ignores these mechanical dimensions; Kirschenbaum shows they're integral.

### Systems/Design Thinking

Kirschenbaum's analysis maps directly onto Star & Bowker's **infrastructure studies**: writing systems depend on invisible infrastructure (file systems, software protocols, format standards) that becomes visible only when it breaks. This parallels the course's emphasis on making writing systems explicit through documentation.

His attention to **format standards** and **protocol** connects to Alexander's constraint analysis: file formats are constraints that enable certain operations (search, merge, version control) while foreclosing others (rich formatting, multimedia embedding). Understanding these tradeoffs is design thinking applied to writing tools.

Kirschenbaum's concern with **preservation and access** anticipates Ribes & Jackson's "Data Bite Man" (Week 10): digital objects require ongoing maintenance, not just initial creation. This shifts emphasis from "writing as product" to "writing as requiring care over time"—a systems perspective.

## Implementation Approach

### How Students Engage

Students read Kirschenbaum's essay (~15 pages) during Week 4, as Movement 2 begins. The guiding questions ask them to:

1. Recall experiences of lost or inaccessible digital writing
2. Identify invisible infrastructure in their current writing tools
3. Connect materiality concerns to the course's fragment accumulation system

These questions bridge Kirschenbaum's theoretical analysis with students' pragmatic challenges. Week 4 is when students are setting up folder structures, establishing naming conventions, and learning about backups—Kirschenbaum explains *why* these practices matter.

### Connection to Course Activities

Week 4 activities include:
- Formalizing folder structure (Fragments/Process/Submissions/Resources)
- Establishing file naming conventions
- Introduction to Zotero for citation management
- Planning for Spec Document milestone

Kirschenbaum provides intellectual justification for what might feel like tedious housekeeping. His framework lets students see: organizing files isn't separate from writing—it *is* writing infrastructure, as consequential as choosing words.

### Ongoing Application

Kirschenbaum's materialism recurs throughout the semester:
- **Movement 2** (Naming): Classification and routing depend on findable, stable files
- **Movement 3** (Scale): As corpus grows, file management becomes critical to usability
- **Movement 4** (Synthesis): Portfolio assembly requires reliable access to semester's accumulated work

Process Archaeology assignment (Movement 4) explicitly asks students to reflect on their file management evolution—Kirschenbaum provides the vocabulary for that reflection.

## Competing Values & Tradeoffs

### What This Reading Offers

- **Validates mundane practices**: Elevates file management to intellectual concern
- **Historical perspective**: Shows digital writing is *historically specific*, not natural or inevitable
- **Critical awareness**: Encourages students to question tools rather than accept them as given

### Potential Challenges

- **Technical vocabulary**: Kirschenbaum uses terms (ASCII, Unicode, blockchain) that may be unfamiliar
- **Apocalyptic tone**: "Textpocalypse" framing could feel alarmist or depressing
- **Relevance question**: Students may wonder why a composition course cares about file formats

### How Design Mitigates Challenges

The course note glosses technical terms in accessible language and connects concepts to students' immediate experience ("when you write in Word, what's happening under the hood?"). The third guiding question explicitly links Kirschenbaum to course practices: fragment accumulation *is* a writing system requiring infrastructure.

Week 4 timing is crucial: students have enough accumulated writing that file management is pragmatically relevant, reducing "why do I care?" resistance. The framing shifts from apocalypse to problem-solving: given textual instability, how do we design systems that survive?

## Evidence & Iteration

### Evidence to Collect

- [ ] Do students demonstrate awareness that file organization choices have consequences?
- [ ] In dev logs, do students reflect on tool choices (not just writing content)?
- [ ] Do students adopt course recommendations (consistent naming, organized folders) voluntarily or grudgingly?
- [ ] In Process Archaeology, can students articulate how file management evolved and why it mattered?

### Revision Notes

If technical vocabulary overwhelms: consider creating a glossary or pre-reading activity defining key terms (format, protocol, infrastructure).

If relevance feels unclear: develop Week 4 activity where students audit their current file organization, identify problems, then read Kirschenbaum to understand why those problems emerge.
