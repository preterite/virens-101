## Design Rationale

### Why This Reading

Kirschenbaum [[@kirschenbaum2023prepa]] provides crucial theoretical grounding for the course's emphasis on file management, folder structure, and documentation practices—elements that might otherwise seem like housekeeping rather than intellectual work. By making visible the material conditions of digital writing (file formats, storage media, software dependencies), Kirschenbaum demonstrates that _how_ we organize and preserve writing is inseparable from _what_ that writing means and can do.

This reading is essential for justifying the course's tech stack choices (plain text where possible, consistent naming conventions, organized folders, redundant storage). Without Kirschenbaum's framework, students may experience these requirements as arbitrary bureaucracy. With it, they understand tool and organization choices as consequential decisions about textual survival and accessibility.

### Why Week 1 Placement

Week 1 is orientation week—before students have accumulated any writing in the course, before they've chosen tools or established workflows. Kirschenbaum arrives at this crucial moment to establish the foundational premise: _how_ you write (tools, formats, storage, organization) shapes _what_ you can write and whether it survives. This Week 1 placement is strategic because it frames all subsequent technical instruction not as arbitrary requirements but as consequential design decisions.

This placement follows the course's "YOLO up, constrain down" principle: Week 1 establishes why constraints matter _before_ applying them. Students need to understand that file formats, naming conventions, and folder structures have intellectual consequences before they experience specific requirements. The reading transforms what could feel like bureaucratic housekeeping into conscious tool selection with long-term stakes.

Kirschenbaum at Week 1 also sets expectations: this course treats writing infrastructure as intellectually serious, not peripheral. Students begin the semester understanding that technical choices (plain text vs. Word, consistent naming vs. ad hoc, organized folders vs. chaotic desktop) are rhetorical and epistemological choices, not just convenience preferences.

## Theoretical Grounding

### Composition Pedagogy

Kirschenbaum extends Ong's [[@ong2012writi]] writing-as-technology insight into the digital realm. Where Ong focused on oral/literate transitions, Kirschenbaum examines print/digital transitions and the instability this creates. His work connects to **material hermeneutics** in composition studies—the idea that textual meaning is inseparable from material form (McGann, Hayles [[@hayles2010read:]]).

The concept of **"textual condition"** (Jerome McGann) underlies Kirschenbaum's analysis: texts don't exist as abstract meanings but as physical/digital artifacts with material constraints. This validates the course's attention to mundane matters (file formats, folder structures, naming conventions) as intellectually significant.

Kirschenbaum's work supports the course outcome on **composing processes** by establishing from Day 1 that "process" includes infrastructure: how files are created, named, stored, backed up, versioned. Traditional first-week orientation often treats technical setup as logistical hurdle to clear before "real" learning begins. Kirschenbaum makes visible that technical choices _are_ intellectual choices that shape the nature of composing itself.

### Systems/Design Thinking

Kirschenbaum's analysis maps directly onto Star [[@star1999ethnp]] & Bowker's **infrastructure studies**: writing systems depend on invisible infrastructure (file systems, software protocols, format standards) that becomes visible only when it breaks. This parallels the course's emphasis on making writing systems explicit through documentation.

His attention to **format standards** and **protocol** connects to Alexander's [[@alexander1964notet]] constraint analysis: file formats are constraints that enable certain operations (search, merge, version control) while foreclosing others (rich formatting, multimedia embedding). Understanding these tradeoffs is design thinking applied to writing tools.

Kirschenbaum's concern with **preservation and access** anticipates Ribes [[@ribes2013datb]] & Jackson's "Data Bite Man" (Week 11): digital objects require ongoing maintenance, not just initial creation. This shifts emphasis from "writing as product" to "writing as requiring care over time"—a systems perspective.

## Implementation Approach

### How Students Engage

Students read Kirschenbaum's essay (~15 pages) during Week 1, as part of course orientation. The guiding questions ask them to:

1. Recall prior experiences of lost or inaccessible digital writing
2. Identify invisible infrastructure in their current writing tools
3. Anticipate what values should guide the writing system they'll build this semester

These questions bridge Kirschenbaum's theoretical analysis with students' lived experience and upcoming practical work. Week 1 timing means students approach the essay prospectively (what system should I build?) rather than retrospectively (how do I fix my mess?).

### Connection to Course Activities

Week 1 activities include:
- Course orientation and syllabus review
- Initial discussion of writing-as-technology theme
- Preview of fragment accumulation approach
- First daily writing exercises

Kirschenbaum provides intellectual grounding for the course's unusual emphasis on technical infrastructure. His framework lets students see from the start: this course's attention to files, formats, and organization isn't persnickety detail work—it's foundational to what writing can be and do.

### Ongoing Application

Kirschenbaum's materialism establishes a lens that students use throughout the semester:
- **Week 2** (tech setup): When choosing tools and establishing workflows, students have framework for evaluating choices
- **Movement 2** (Naming): Classification and routing depend on findable, stable files—infrastructure Kirschenbaum made visible
- **Movement 3** (Scale): As corpus grows, file management becomes critical to usability—Kirschenbaum's warnings about "textpocalypse" feel prescient
- **Movement 4** (Synthesis): Portfolio assembly requires reliable access to semester's accumulated work—system design choices made in Week 1 matter now

Process Archaeology assignment (Movement 4) explicitly asks students to reflect on their file management evolution—Kirschenbaum provides the vocabulary and framework for that reflection from the semester's beginning.

## Competing Values & Tradeoffs

### What This Reading Offers

- **Validates mundane practices**: Elevates file management to intellectual concern
- **Historical perspective**: Shows digital writing is _historically specific_, not natural or inevitable
- **Critical awareness**: Encourages students to question tools rather than accept them as given

### Potential Challenges

- **Technical vocabulary**: Kirschenbaum uses terms (ASCII, Unicode, blockchain) that may be unfamiliar
- **Apocalyptic tone**: "Textpocalypse" framing could feel alarmist or depressing
- **Relevance question**: Students may wonder why a composition course cares about file formats

### How Design Mitigates Challenges

The course note glosses technical terms in accessible language and connects concepts to students' immediate experience ("when you currently write...what's happening under the hood?"). The guiding questions explicitly ask students to reflect on _prior_ experiences of lost writing and to anticipate values for the system they'll build—making Kirschenbaum immediately relevant even before course work begins.

Week 1 timing is crucial: students haven't yet invested in any particular tool or workflow, so they approach Kirschenbaum's analysis with openness rather than defensiveness. The framing shifts from apocalypse to design opportunity: given textual instability, how should we design writing systems that survive and remain useful?

The third guiding question explicitly frames students as _designers_ of their own writing systems, not passive recipients of instructor requirements. This positions Week 1 tool choices as student agency (what values matter to you?) rather than arbitrary rules.

## Evidence & Iteration

### Evidence to Collect

- [ ] Do students demonstrate awareness that file organization choices have consequences?
- [ ] In dev logs, do students reflect on tool choices (not just writing content)?
- [ ] Do students adopt course recommendations (consistent naming, organized folders) voluntarily or grudgingly?
- [ ] In Process Archaeology, can students articulate how file management evolved and why it mattered?

### Revision Notes

If technical vocabulary overwhelms: consider creating a glossary or pre-reading activity defining key terms (format, protocol, infrastructure). However, Week 1 placement allows time for concepts to develop gradually rather than requiring immediate mastery.

If relevance feels unclear: the Week 1 timing actually _prevents_ this problem by establishing that infrastructure matters _before_ students experience frustration. Students build systems correctly from the start rather than retrofitting organization onto chaos.

If students resist "pessimistic" framing: emphasize that Kirschenbaum provides design principles for resilient systems, not just warnings about failure. The essay is ultimately optimistic about conscious tool selection and intentional system design.
