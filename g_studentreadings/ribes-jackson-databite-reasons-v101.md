## Design Rationale

### Why This Reading

Ribes and Jackson's essay provides crucial validation for the maintenance labor students have been performing all semester: reorganizing fragments, updating documentation, backing up files, cleaning up tags. Without this reading, students may experience maintenance work as low-value busywork ("not real writing"). With it, they understand that corpus maintenance is essential intellectual work—and that the course's emphasis on documentation and organization isn't arbitrary but enables long-term usability.

This reading reframes writing from heroic creation (inspiration → draft → finished product) to ongoing care (accumulation → maintenance → consolidation → maintenance → use). The shift parallels feminist scholarship on care work and maintenance as undervalued labor. Ribes & Jackson make visible that all accumulated material—data, fragments, archives—requires care to remain usable.

### Why Week 10 Placement

Week 10 is late in Movement 3 (Operating at Scale), when students have been managing substantial corpora (30-42 fragments) for several weeks and have experienced maintenance challenges firsthand: files they can't find, fragments whose purpose they've forgotten, organizational systems that stopped working. They've *done* maintenance work; Ribes & Jackson helps them recognize and value it.

This placement follows constraint sequencing: students need to *experience* maintenance as necessary labor before theoretical validation resonates. Week 10 provides enough accumulated corpus (10 weeks of writing) that maintenance isn't abstract but urgent. Too early (Week 5), students wouldn't yet face substantial maintenance demands; Week 10 provides both experience and vocabulary for Portfolio preparation.

## Theoretical Grounding

### Composition Pedagogy

Ribes & Jackson extends **labor-based grading** (Inoue) and **process pedagogy** by making visible the invisible work of corpus maintenance. Traditional composition assessment values products (finished essays) over process (drafting, revision); even process pedagogy often focuses on generative work (drafting, feedback) while ignoring maintenance (filing, organizing, documenting).

The essay connects to **feminist composition scholarship** on care work and invisible labor (Kirsch, Ritchie, Micciche). Just as feminist scholars argue domestic labor and emotional work deserve recognition, Ribes & Jackson argue maintenance work deserves recognition as intellectual labor. The course's documentation requirements make this labor visible—and gradeable.

**Archive studies** and **digital humanities** scholarship emphasizes curation and preservation as ongoing work, not one-time events. Students building writing corpora are doing archival work: their dev logs, spec documents, and Process Archaeology assignment parallel archival description and provenance documentation.

### Systems/Design Thinking

Ribes & Jackson's work sits at intersection of STS (Science and Technology Studies) and CSCW (Computer-Supported Cooperative Work), studying how large-scale collaborative systems are maintained over time:

- **Temporal scales**: Systems that work at short timescales (single semester, single researcher) fail at longer timescales (career, organization, discipline). This connects to Alexander's design for change and to the course's emphasis on building transferable systems.

- **Documentation as infrastructure**: Ribes & Jackson show documentation isn't separate from data but essential infrastructure enabling data use. This parallels Star's infrastructure theory and the course's emphasis that process docs aren't "meta" but constitutive.

- **Decay without care**: All systems tend toward entropy (Second Law of Thermodynamics adapted to information systems). File formats obsolete, contexts forgotten, organizations degrade. Countering decay requires ongoing energy—maintenance work.

- **Invisible labor**: Maintenance work becomes invisible (like Star's infrastructure) unless deliberately foregrounded. Ribes & Jackson's metaphor "data bite man" (play on "dog-bite-man" journalism non-story) captures how maintenance is too boring to report but essential to function.

## Implementation Approach

### How Students Engage

Students read Ribes & Jackson's essay (~20 pages) during Week 10, late Movement 3. The guiding questions ask them to:

1. Identify maintenance labor they've been performing on their corpus
2. Examine decay in their early fragments (context loss, forgotten purposes)
3. Reframe documentation from requirement to care work

These questions operationalize maintenance concepts by connecting them to students' ongoing corpus management. Rather than learning about long-term ecological studies, students use Ribes & Jackson as mirror for reflecting on their own maintenance practices.

### Connection to Course Activities

Week 10 activities include:
- Corpus consolidation work (combining, reorganizing, tagging)
- Final dev log entries of Movement 3
- Planning transition to Movement 4 (portfolio assembly)

Ribes & Jackson provides intellectual framework for consolidation activities: combining fragments isn't just "cleanup" but essential maintenance enabling future use. Dev logs aren't bureaucratic requirements but care work preserving context and decisions.

### Ongoing Application

Ribes & Jackson's framework directly informs Movement 4 work:

- **Process Archaeology**: Requires students to "dig through" their semester's corpus like archaeologists, reconstructing decisions and evolution—exactly parallel to Ribes & Jackson's researchers reconstructing decades of study history
- **Portfolio assembly**: Requires accessing and using material accumulated over 15 weeks—usability depends on maintenance work done throughout semester
- **Transfer reflection**: Asks what maintenance practices might adapt to other contexts

## Competing Values & Tradeoffs

### What This Reading Offers

- **Validates maintenance labor**: Elevates reorganization, documentation, backup to essential work
- **Reframes "boring" work**: Maintenance isn't low-skill busywork but intellectual labor requiring judgment
- **Connects writing to broader scholarship**: Data stewardship, archival work, care theory

### Potential Challenges

- **Non-writing context**: Essay about ecological data may feel distant from composition
- **Length and density**: 20-page academic article late in semester
- **Potential discouragement**: Emphasizing decay/entropy could feel overwhelming

### How Design Mitigates Challenges

The course note explicitly connects data maintenance to writing corpus maintenance: "writing corpora, like data archives, don't maintain themselves." Guiding questions continuously bridge ecology study to students' fragment collections.

Week 10 timing, while late, is necessary: students need substantial accumulated material to understand maintenance challenges. The essay validates work they're already doing, reducing rather than increasing burden—it explains *why* their maintenance efforts matter.

The third guiding question reframes documentation from compliance ("instructor makes me") to care ("I preserve usability for future self"). This shifts affect from resentment to agency: documentation as self-care, not surveillance.

## Evidence & Iteration

### Evidence to Collect

- [ ] Do students use maintenance/care vocabulary in describing corpus management work?
- [ ] Can students identify specific maintenance labor and articulate its value?
- [ ] Do students demonstrate awareness that documentation preserves context across time?
- [ ] In Process Archaeology, do students reflect on maintenance evolution and its importance?

### Revision Notes

If ecological context creates barriers: consider adding companion reading from digital humanities or archival science about personal information management or creative writing portfolios.

If length is prohibitive: could excerpt sections on documentation, context preservation, and invisible labor (roughly pages 3-8, 12-15).

If timing feels too late/overwhelming: emphasize that reading validates work already done (retrospective framing) rather than adding new requirements. Consider scheduling as optional reading for students who want theoretical grounding.
