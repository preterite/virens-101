## Context

You'll read Vannevar Bush's "As We May Think" during **Week 13** of Movement 4 (Synthesis), near the end of the semester as you complete Process Archaeology and assemble your portfolio. Written in 1945, Bush imagines future information technology (the "memex"—a mechanized desk storing microfilm documents connected by associative links). This reading provides historical perspective on ideas the course has been enacting: associative connection, accumulation of fragments, building personal knowledge systems, and the tension between linear presentation and networked thinking.

## Description

Bush proposes the "memex"—a desk-sized machine where individuals build personal libraries of microfilmed documents connected by "trails" of associative links. Users could follow these trails (like clicking hyperlinks before hyperlinks existed), add new connections, and share trails with others. Bush argues that human thinking is associative (one idea suggests another) but that information storage is linear (books, filing cabinets). His vision: technology that matches how minds actually work—building knowledge through connection rather than hierarchical classification.

## Guiding Questions

Before you read, consider these questions. Return to them as you engage with Bush's 1945 vision:

1. **Associative vs. linear**: Bush contrasts associative thinking (how minds work—ideas suggest related ideas) with linear storage (how books work—fixed sequences). Your fragment corpus is associative (connections between fragments) but your portfolio must be linear (one page follows another). As you assemble your portfolio, what do you gain and lose by imposing linear order on associative material? How might you preserve traces of associative connections in linear presentation?

2. **Personal knowledge systems**: Bush imagines individuals building customized information systems reflecting their unique interests and thinking patterns. Over 13 weeks, you've built a writing system—your fragment corpus, folder structure, tagging system, dev logs. How is your system personalized (reflecting your needs and thinking)? If someone else tried to use your system, what would they need to understand? How does this connect to Process Archaeology's goal of making your system visible?

3. **Trails and transfer**: Bush's memex users create "trails"—sequences of connected documents that others can follow or adapt. Your Process Archaeology documents a "trail" through the semester—showing how you connected fragments, solved problems, evolved practices. How might documenting your trail help someone else learn from your process? What does this suggest about why the course emphasizes making process visible rather than just producing products?
