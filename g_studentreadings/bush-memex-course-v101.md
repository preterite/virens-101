## Context

You'll read Vannevar Bush's [[@bush1945thinl]] "As We May Think" during **Week 10** of Movement 3 (Operating at Scale), alongside Star's "Ethnography of Infrastructure." Written in 1945, Bush imagines future information technology (the "memex"—a mechanized desk storing microfilm documents connected by associative links). This reading provides historical perspective on ideas the course has been enacting: associative connection, accumulation of fragments, building personal knowledge systems, and making invisible infrastructure visible. Where Star theorizes infrastructure, Bush imagines building it—his memex is infrastructure made visible on purpose.

## Description

Bush proposes the "memex"—a desk-sized machine where individuals build personal libraries of microfilmed documents connected by "trails" of associative links. Users could follow these trails (like clicking hyperlinks before hyperlinks existed), add new connections, and share trails with others. Bush argues that human thinking is associative (one idea suggests another) but that information storage is linear (books, filing cabinets). His vision: technology that matches how minds actually work—building knowledge through connection rather than hierarchical classification.

## Guiding Questions

Before you read, consider these questions. Return to them as you engage with Bush's 1945 vision:

1. **Associative vs. linear** (connects to Star): Bush contrasts associative thinking (how minds work—ideas suggest related ideas) with linear storage (how books work—fixed sequences). Star shows how infrastructure becomes visible only when it breaks. Together: Your fragment corpus operates associatively (connections between fragments) but many systems force linear thinking. As you complete your BEAM Portfolio, what invisible infrastructures shape how you can present your research? How do citation formats, document structures, or platform constraints force linearity onto associative work?

2. **Personal knowledge systems** (connects to Salvatori): Bush imagines individuals building customized information systems reflecting their unique interests and thinking patterns. Salvatori (Week 3) showed how difficulty makes your thinking processes visible. Now at Week 10, you've built a substantial corpus—your fragments, your BEAM entries, your dev logs. How has this system become personalized (reflecting your needs and thinking)? What does your corpus's structure reveal about how you think and work? If someone else tried to use your system, what would they need to understand about you?

3. **Trails and infrastructure** (connects to both readings): Bush's memex users create "trails"—sequences of connected documents that others can follow. Your BEAM Portfolio documents a "trail" through sources—showing how you connected readings, built arguments, discovered relationships. But this trail depends on infrastructure (files, folders, citations, links). How do the invisible systems you've been using (file organization, Zotero, dev logs) enable or constrain the trails you can create and share? What becomes visible about infrastructure when you try to show someone else your research path?
