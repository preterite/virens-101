## Context

You'll examine three exemplary README files from software projects during **Week 2** of Movement 1 (Surfacing), alongside Ong's "Writing Restructures Consciousness." This is early in the semester—you're still building writing habits and setting up your technology infrastructure. READMEs are the "front door" of software projects—they explain what the project does, why it exists, and how to use it. These documents model what the course will ask you to create throughout the semester: clear documentation that makes invisible work visible and helps others (including your future self) understand and use what you've built.

---

## Description

You'll read three README files:

**1. Stack-in-a-box README**: Explains a tool for quickly deploying web applications. Notice how it starts with "what this solves" before explaining "how to use it"—anticipating audience needs.

**2. Day8/re-frame README**: Documents a framework for building web applications. Pay attention to how it structures information hierarchically (overview → concepts → tutorials → reference) and uses visual aids (diagrams, code examples).

**3. Standard Readme**: Meta-document explaining README conventions themselves. Describes what sections READMEs typically include and why each section matters.

These examples show documentation as a genre with conventions (expected sections, tone, structure) that coordinate expectations between writers and readers. READMEs demonstrate writing-as-specification: making explicit what others need to know.

## Guiding Questions

Before you read, consider these questions. Return to them as you examine the README examples:

1. **Documentation as genre**: READMEs follow conventions—typical sections include "What is this?", "Why does it exist?", "How do I use it?", "How do I contribute?" What makes these conventions useful rather than restrictive? How might understanding README genre help you think about the course's process documentation requirements (dev logs, spec documents)?

2. **Audience and prior knowledge**: Different READMEs assume different audience expertise. How do these examples signal what readers are expected to know already versus what the document will explain? When you write documentation (dev logs, portfolio reflections), who's your audience, and what can you assume they already understand?

3. **Making invisible work visible**: READMEs make software projects understandable to others by documenting decisions, explaining structures, and providing context. What aspects of *your* writing process are currently invisible (choices made, problems solved, approaches attempted)? How might you document these to make your process legible to others—or to your future self when you've forgotten why you did something?
