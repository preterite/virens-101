## Design Rationale

### Why This Reading

Norman [[@norman2013desig]] provides accessible, concrete vocabulary for analyzing the tools and systems students have built over the semester. Concepts like affordances, constraints, signifiers, and feedback give students language to explain *why* certain tools worked well or poorly—not just that they did. This vocabulary is essential for Process Archaeology assignment, which asks students to analyze their writing system's evolution.

Without Norman's framework, students might describe process changes descriptively ("I switched from Google Docs to Word") without analytical depth. With Norman, they can explain causally ("Word's Track Changes afforded version comparison, changing my revision process"). The reading transforms process documentation from narrative to analysis.

### Why Week 12 Placement

Week 12 marks the beginning of Movement 4 (Synthesis) and the start of Process Archaeology assignment. Students need Norman's vocabulary immediately before beginning this analytical work. They've built writing systems over 12 weeks and now must analyze them—Norman provides the analytical toolkit precisely when needed.

This placement follows constraint sequencing and "familiarize before stakes" principles: students encounter design vocabulary just before applying it in high-stakes work (portfolio assembly). Earlier placement (Week 6-8) would introduce concepts before students have sufficient system complexity to analyze; Week 12 provides both complexity and urgency.

## Theoretical Grounding

### Composition Pedagogy

Norman's design thinking connects to **rhetorical awareness** and **genre theory** in composition: just as affordances shape possible actions with physical objects, genre conventions and discourse community norms shape possible actions in writing contexts. Norman's framework makes this parallel explicit and analyzable.

The concept of **constraints as enabling** (not just limiting) parallels composition scholarship on genre (Miller [[@miller1984genrf]], Bawarshi): genre conventions constrain choices but enable communication by establishing shared expectations. Norman helps students see writing constraints (word limits, format requirements, citation styles) as design choices that afford certain effects while foreclosing others.

**Usability** in technical communication (Redish, Schriver) draws heavily on Norman. The course's emphasis on documentation (dev logs, READMEs, spec documents) as making systems understandable parallels Norman's emphasis on discoverability and signifiers. Process documentation creates signifiers for understanding writing systems.

### Systems/Design Thinking

Norman synthesizes ecological psychology (Gibson's affordances), cognitive science (human perception and action), and systems thinking (feedback loops, emergence). Key connections:

- **Affordances** (Gibson): What environment offers an actor. Norman adapts this: what designed objects offer users. Writing tools afford different actions (index cards afford portability; Word affords formatting). Tool choices are design choices with cognitive consequences.

- **Constraints as leverage**: Norman's constraints (physical, cultural, semantic, logical) parallel Alexander's [[@alexander1964notet]] constraint decomposition and Meadows's [[@meadows2008lever]] leverage points. Constraint design determines what's possible—high-leverage intervention.

- **Feedback loops**: Norman emphasizes immediate, clear feedback enables learning and improvement. This connects directly to Meadows's systems thinking (feedback loops as system structure) and to the course's peer review emphasis (changing feedback timing as high-leverage intervention).

- **Human-centered design**: Norman argues design should fit humans, not vice versa. This parallels the course's approach: design writing systems that fit students' cognitive and practical constraints rather than demanding students adapt to arbitrary academic conventions.

## Implementation Approach

### How Students Engage

Students read Norman's Chapter 1 (~20-25 pages) during Week 12, start of Movement 4. The guiding questions ask them to:

1. Analyze tools used this semester through affordance/constraint lens
2. Examine their own signifier systems (file names, folder structures)
3. Map feedback loops in their writing process

These questions operationalize Norman's concepts by applying them to students' specific tools and systems. Rather than learning design principles abstractly, students use Norman as analytical framework for their own practices—exactly what Process Archaeology requires.

### Connection to Course Activities

Week 12 activities include:
- Beginning Process Archaeology assignment
- Corpus audit for portfolio selection
- Planning portfolio organization and presentation

Norman's vocabulary enables these activities: Process Archaeology explicitly asks students to analyze tools, constraints, and feedback using design terminology. Portfolio organization decisions become design choices about signifiers (how to make portfolio structure discoverable) and affordances (what actions portfolio enables for readers).

### Ongoing Application

Norman's framework structures Movement 4 work:

- **Process Archaeology**: Central analytical vocabulary comes from Norman (affordances, constraints, signifiers, feedback)
- **Portfolio assembly**: Design choices about organization, navigation, presentation
- **Transfer reflection**: Analyzing what affordances/constraints transfer to new contexts

The portfolio cover letter functions as design documentation: explaining system design (affordances, constraints) to users (readers) who don't share designer's (writer's) knowledge.

## Competing Values & Tradeoffs

### What This Reading Offers

- **Accessible vocabulary**: Design concepts applicable beyond writing contexts
- **Concrete examples**: Doors, faucets, stoves = tangible objects students have experienced
- **Analytical depth**: Transforms descriptive process reflection into analytical design critique

### Potential Challenges

- **Non-writing context**: Examples from industrial design may feel distant from composition
- **Terminology load**: Affordances, signifiers, constraints, feedback, mapping, conceptual models = many new terms
- **Late-semester timing**: Week 12 introduces demanding concepts when students are fatigued

### How Design Mitigates Challenges

The course note explicitly bridges physical design to writing tools: guiding questions ask about index cards, Word, Zotero—concrete tools students have used. Norman's terminology is pre-organized in accessible language, reducing cognitive load.

Week 12 timing, while late, provides maximum grounding: students have 12 weeks of tool experience to analyze. Norman's concepts aren't abstract but names for patterns students have experienced. The immediate application (Process Archaeology) demonstrates utility, reducing resistance.

The first guiding question structures analysis: listing specific tools, then analyzing their affordances and constraints. This scaffolds Norman's framework application, making demanding work manageable.

## Evidence & Iteration

### Evidence to Collect

- [ ] Do students use Norman's vocabulary (affordances, constraints, signifiers, feedback) accurately in Process Archaeology?
- [ ] Can students explain tool choices causally (affordances shaped practice) not just descriptively (I used X)?
- [ ] Do students demonstrate understanding that design choices (their own organizational systems) shape behavior?
- [ ] In portfolio design, do students make explicit signifier choices to aid navigation?

### Revision Notes

If terminology overwhelms: consider creating visual glossary with examples from students' tools, or collaborative vocabulary-building activity before reading Norman.

If industrial design examples feel distant: supplement with examples from digital writing tools (interface design, document templates, style guides) before reading Norman to establish connection.

If timing feels too late for complex reading: could excerpt key sections (affordances, signifiers, constraints, feedback) rather than assign full chapter, though Norman's integrated argument may suffer.
