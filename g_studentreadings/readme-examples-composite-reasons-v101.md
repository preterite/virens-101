## Design Rationale

### Why These Readings

README files provide accessible, practical models for the kind of process documentation the course requires. Unlike theoretical readings about documentation, READMEs are *functional* documents that students can immediately imitate: they demonstrate clear structure, audience awareness, and how to make complex projects understandable. These examples bridge technical/professional writing and composition pedagogy, showing that "real world" documentation follows recognizable genre conventions.

READMEs are especially valuable because they're specification documents—they document *systems* (software projects) in ways that make those systems usable by others. This directly parallels what students do when they document their writing processes: making invisible systems (how they write, what choices they make, why they do things) explicit and transferable.

### Why Week 4-5 Placement

Weeks 4-5 fall early in Movement 2 (Naming), when students are learning classification, documentation, and systematic organization. The Spec Document milestone (end of Movement 2) asks students to document their writing system—READMEs provide genre models for this work. Reading exemplary READMEs before creating spec documents gives students concrete patterns to adapt.

This placement follows constraint sequencing: students need to see what good documentation looks like before attempting to create their own. Examining READMEs in Week 4-5 gives students several weeks to internalize genre conventions before the Spec Document is due (Week 7).

## Theoretical Grounding

### Composition Pedagogy

README analysis draws on **genre theory** (Carolyn Miller's "genre as social action"): genres coordinate social activity by establishing shared expectations about form and function. READMEs demonstrate that technical documentation is a genre with conventions that serve communicative purposes, not arbitrary rules.

This connects to **Writing in the Disciplines** (WAW/WID) pedagogy: teaching students to analyze genre conventions in professional contexts helps them understand how discourse communities coordinate work. READMEs show how software development communities use documentation to enable collaboration—a rhetorical situation students can understand even if they're not programmers.

The emphasis on **making work visible** connects to process pedagogy and feminist composition theory (Kirsch, Ritchie): documentation makes invisible labor explicit, which is both pedagogically valuable (enables reflection) and politically important (recognizes work that's typically unacknowledged).

### Systems/Design Thinking

READMEs exemplify several systems/design principles:

- **Documentation as interface**: READMEs are the boundary between system (software project) and user. This parallels Norman's concept of interfaces making systems understandable. Students' process documentation serves similar function—making their writing system understandable to others (peers, instructors, future selves).

- **Specification documents**: READMEs are specs—they document system structure, dependencies, and operation. Alexander emphasizes that design process requires explicit constraint documentation; READMEs model this practice.

- **Maintenance and evolution**: Good READMEs anticipate future users/contributors and explain not just "how to use" but "how this works." This parallels the course's emphasis on documentation supporting future work—Process Archaeology assignment will ask students to read their own past documentation.

## Implementation Approach

### How Students Engage

Students examine three README files during Weeks 4-5, Movement 2. The guiding questions ask them to:

1. Analyze README genre conventions and their utility
2. Consider audience assumptions and prior knowledge
3. Connect software documentation to their own process documentation needs

These questions treat READMEs as rhetorical texts, not just technical examples. Students analyze how READMEs work (genre analysis) before attempting to create analogous documents (Spec Document assignment).

### Connection to Course Activities

Weeks 4-5 activities include:
- Establishing folder structures and naming conventions
- Learning classification and routing practices
- Planning Spec Document (due Week 7)

READMEs provide models for the Spec Document: students can adapt README structure (What is this? Why does it exist? How does it work? How do I use it?) to document their own writing systems. README sections map onto spec document sections, making genre transfer concrete.

### Ongoing Application

README principles recur throughout the semester:
- **Movement 2**: Spec Document explicitly adapts README structure
- **Movement 3**: Dev logs function like running documentation (updating READMEs as project evolves)
- **Movement 4**: Portfolio cover letter functions like README—introducing collection, explaining structure, guiding readers

## Competing Values & Tradeoffs

### What These Readings Offer

- **Concrete genre models**: Shows documentation structure students can imitate
- **Non-academic examples**: Technical writing feels "real world," may reduce resistance
- **Transferable principles**: Documentation concepts apply across contexts (software, writing, research)

### Potential Challenges

- **Technical context**: Students unfamiliar with software may struggle with content
- **Too specialized**: May seem irrelevant to humanities/social science students
- **Genre distance**: READMEs are technical documents; connection to composition may feel unclear

### How Design Mitigates Challenges

The course note explicitly frames READMEs as *genre models* for process documentation, not technical content to master. Guiding questions focus on rhetorical features (audience, structure, visibility) rather than technical details. The third question directly connects READMEs to students' work: "What aspects of your writing process are currently invisible?"

Week 4-5 placement helps: students have accumulated enough writing experience that "documenting a system" makes sense—they have a system to document. The Spec Document assignment provides immediate application, demonstrating relevance.

## Evidence & Iteration

### Evidence to Collect

- [ ] Do students adapt README structure effectively in Spec Documents?
- [ ] Can students articulate genre conventions (typical sections, audience assumptions, documentation purposes)?
- [ ] Do students demonstrate awareness that documentation serves future users (including future selves)?
- [ ] In dev logs and reflections, do students show improved documentation practices?

### Revision Notes

If technical context creates barriers: consider supplementing with non-software documentation examples (recipe format conventions, IKEA assembly instructions, museum exhibition guides) to show genre principles apply broadly.

If connection to composition feels unclear: develop Week 5 activity where students draft mini-READMEs for everyday systems (morning routine, study habits, social media management) before tackling writing system documentation.
