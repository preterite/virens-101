## Design Rationale

### Why These Readings

This composite addresses a central concern of Movement 2: classification. As students accumulate fragments and begin organizing them, Borges [[@borges1962labyr]]/Quine/libraryofbabel dramatize why classification matters—and what happens when it fails. The library paradox (infinite information = useless information) provides both conceptual framework and experiential proof (exploring the website demonstrates the problem viscerally).

These readings reframe what might feel like personal failure ("I can't find anything in my fragments") as a fundamental information-theoretic problem. The library paradox validates emerging organizational challenges while introducing concepts (signal/noise, classification systems, retrieval problems) that help students think strategically about the naming and classification work that defines M2.

### Why Week 6 Placement

Week 6 falls in the middle of Movement 2 (Naming), when classification and organization are the movement's central work. Students have accumulated 12-18 fragments across five weeks and are beginning to feel the organizational challenge: fragments that made sense when written become harder to locate, classify, and connect as volume grows. The library readings arrive alongside Jackson's "My Body—A Wunderkammer," pairing a conceptual warning about classification failure with a creative model of accumulation-as-composition.

This placement follows constraint sequencing: students need to have accumulated enough material to feel organizational pressure before the library paradox resonates. Week 6 is early enough that classification habits formed now will serve students through M3's scale challenges, and late enough that students have genuine organizational complexity to work with. The readings also anticipate the Spec Document (due mid-week) and Constraint Audit (brainstormed this week), both of which require students to articulate system design choices.

## Theoretical Grounding

### Composition Pedagogy

This composite connects to **information literacy** and **research pedagogy**: students often think research means "find more sources," but experienced researchers know the challenge is managing, filtering, and synthesizing what you've found. Borges illustrates why "more is better" eventually inverts into "more is worse."

The readings support the course's critique of **episodic assignment structures**. Traditional composition courses treat each paper as independent—start from zero, generate ideas, write, submit, move on. Borges reveals the problem with the opposite extreme (infinite accumulation without selection). The course seeks middle ground: accumulation with ongoing curation.

**Classification and folksonomy** (tagging, organizing) emerge as crucial literacy practices, not housekeeping. Star [[@star1999ethnp]] & Bowker's work (Week 10) will extend this: classification systems are always political and always inadequate. Borges's library demonstrates the stakes: bad classification = unusable corpus.

### Systems/Design Thinking

Borges's library exemplifies several systems concepts:

- **Negative emergence**: System properties that harm rather than help. The library's completeness creates uselessness—the whole is _less_ than the sum of parts. This connects to Meadows's [[@meadows2008lever]] systems thinking: sometimes adding more creates worse outcomes.

- **Signal/noise ratio**: Information theory concept (Shannon [[@shannon1948mathf]], Weaver) made concrete. As noise increases relative to signal, communication degrades. Students' fragment corpora face this risk: as volume grows, finding relevant fragments becomes harder.

- **Search and retrieval**: The library has perfect _storage_ but impossible _retrieval_. This parallels database design (Manovich): structure determines usability. Students need retrieval systems (tags, file names, folder structure) not just storage systems.

- **Scale transitions**: Systems that work at small scale fail at large scale. This is Brooks's [[@brooks1986silve]] insight (adding programmers makes projects later) and Alexander's [[@alexander1964notet]] constraint decomposition challenge. The library readings plant this awareness in M2 so that when M3 arrives, students have vocabulary for diagnosing scale failures rather than just experiencing them.

## Implementation Approach

### How Students Engage

Students engage with three texts during Week 6:

1. **Read Borges** (~8 pages): Short story format accessible, imaginatively engaging
2. **Read Quine** (~short essay): Philosophical analysis adding rigor to Borges's concept
3. **Explore libraryofbabel.info**: Interactive experience makes concept concrete

The guiding questions ask students to:

1. Connect scale and classification problems to their own corpus management challenges
2. Examine their emerging classification/retrieval systems
3. Distinguish signal from noise in context-dependent ways

These questions operationalize the library concept by applying it immediately to students' ongoing work. Rather than treating Borges as literary analysis, students use the library paradox as diagnostic tool for their own classification practices—the core work of M2.

### Connection to Course Activities

Week 6 activities include:
- Spec Document development and peer review (Eli Review Cycle 2)
- Constraint Audit brainstorming
- Fragment work with Zotero check-in
- Jackson's "My Body" as companion reading

The library readings provide intellectual framework for M2's classification emphasis. When students discover their fragments are becoming harder to find or their organizational system is straining, Borges explains why: classification systems adequate for 5 fragments begin to struggle at 15. The Spec Document, due this week, asks students to articulate their system design—Borges dramatizes what's at stake in those design choices.

### Ongoing Application

The library paradox recurs throughout the remaining movements:

- **Rest of M2**: Classification and constraint work through Week 7 directly applies Borges's framework—students design systems to prevent the library problem
- **Movement 3**: As students consolidate at scale (combining, cutting, organizing), they're solving the library problem—reducing noise, improving signal, making corpus usable
- **Movement 4**: Portfolio curation is the ultimate library problem—from accumulated corpus, select what to present and in what order
- **Process Archaeology**: Students analyze how their corpus management strategies evolved as scale increased

## Competing Values & Tradeoffs

### What These Readings Offer

- **Vivid conceptual model**: Library metaphor is memorable, helps students think about scale
- **Non-academic genres**: Story + philosophy + website = varied engagement modes
- **Experiential learning**: libraryofbabel.info lets students _experience_ the problem, not just read about it

### Potential Challenges

- **Literary context**: Borges is fiction; students may resist applying to composition
- **Abstract concepts**: Information theory and scale problems are conceptually demanding
- **Potential discouragement**: Readings could make corpus management feel hopeless

### How Design Mitigates Challenges

The course note explicitly frames readings as addressing students' immediate challenge: "you've accumulated substantial writing... finding anything becomes nearly impossible." This grounds abstract concepts in lived experience.

The libraryofbabel.info website is crucial: exploring it makes the library paradox tangible. Students can search for any phrase and "find" it, experiencing both the wonder (everything exists!) and the uselessness (location information is meaningless) that Borges describes.

Week 6 placement ensures students encounter the library problem while classification is the central work of M2. They read about information overload and immediately apply solutions through Spec Document and Constraint Audit activities, developing habits that will serve them through M3's scale challenges.

## Evidence & Iteration

### Evidence to Collect

- [ ] Do students use library/scale metaphors when discussing corpus management challenges?
- [ ] Can students articulate signal/noise distinction in context-dependent ways?
- [ ] Do students demonstrate awareness that organizational systems must evolve as scale increases?
- [ ] In Process Archaeology, do students reflect meaningfully on how they solved scale problems?

### Revision Notes

If Borges feels too abstract: consider adding a more concrete reading about personal information management (PIM) or note-taking systems at scale.

If libraryofbabel.info is inaccessible or overwhelming: create simplified demonstration or structured exploration activity with specific search prompts.

If timing feels premature (corpus not yet large enough): the library readings work prospectively as well as diagnostically—students learn classification principles before they desperately need them. This follows the course's "familiarize before stakes" principle.
