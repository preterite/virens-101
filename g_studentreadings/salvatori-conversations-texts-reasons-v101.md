## Design Rationale

### Why This Reading

Salvatori's [[@salvatori1996conve]] "Conversations with Texts" provides the theoretical foundation for the course's second principle: **difficulty-as-diagnostic**. This is the cornerstone reading for understanding how the course treats struggle, confusion, and challenge not as problems to eliminate but as informational signals about where intellectual work is happening. Without this framework, students may interpret the course's emphasis on process documentation and failure analysis as punitive surveillance rather than as inquiry into their own thinking.

### Why Week 3 Placement

This reading arrives in Week 3, early in the semester, because students need this lens _before_ they encounter significant difficulty in readings or assignments. Salvatori reframes difficulty as productive before students have internalized deficit narratives about their struggles. The constraint sequencing logic: give students a framework for interpreting difficulty before they experience sustained difficulty, so they have vocabulary and concepts ready when challenges arise.

Sequencing with Ong [[@ong2012writi]] (Week 2) is strategic: Ong establishes that writing reshapes consciousness (technology frame), then Salvatori establishes that reading difficulty reveals consciousness-in-process (pedagogy frame). Together they create the conceptual foundation for the course's systems-thinking approach to writing.

### Difficulty Pair A (with Alexander)

Salvatori is one half of **Difficulty Pair A** (Salvatori + Alexander [[@alexander1964notet]], "Failure as Diagnostic"). Students encounter both readings within a 4-week span:

- **Salvatori (Week 3)**: Difficulty makes reading processes visible—what's hard reveals where cognitive work is happening
- **Alexander (Week 7)**: Misfit makes design problems visible—where form fails context reveals where improvement is needed

The thematic connection: both treat **the moment something goes wrong as the moment real learning begins**. Salvatori asks what difficulty reveals about reading; Alexander asks what misfit reveals about design. Together they provide a framework for treating breakdown as the starting point for understanding, whether you're reading a text or designing a system. The 4-week gap allows students to develop Salvatori's difficulty-as-diagnostic practice before Alexander gives them a systematic method for locating and resolving misfits.

## Theoretical Grounding

### Composition Pedagogy

Salvatori's work is foundational in composition studies for its recuperation of difficulty as pedagogically valuable rather than something to remediate. Her "difficulty paper" assignment—asking students to describe and analyze what made a text hard—has been widely adopted because it makes metacognition concrete and transforms students from passive recipients to active inquirers.

The concept of reading-as-conversation connects to dialogic pedagogy (Bakhtin, Freire [[@freire2000pedag]]) and reader-response theory, but Salvatori's specific contribution is making the _mechanics_ of that conversation visible and teachable. She provides practical strategies (marking texts, writing about difficulty, comparing responses) that operationalize theoretical claims about active reading.

This reading supports the course outcome on **reading-writing connection** by explicitly treating reading and writing as intertwined: Salvatori argues that writing about reading makes thought processes visible and revisable, which is also how writing-about-writing works in the course's recursive model.

### Systems/Design Thinking

While Salvatori writes from composition pedagogy rather than systems thinking, her framework maps onto key systems concepts:

- **Difficulty-as-diagnostic** parallels **failure-as-information** in engineering (Brooks [[@brooks1986silve]], Norman [[@norman2013desig]]). When a system fails, the failure reveals constraints, assumptions, or interactions that weren't visible during smooth operation. Similarly, reading difficulty reveals cognitive work.

- **Marks on the page** parallel **version control annotations** in software development. Salvatori treats student annotations as artifacts revealing decision-making processes—what readers attend to, what they value, what confuses them. This anticipates the course's emphasis on process documentation making invisible work visible.

- **Recursive reading** (reading, reflecting, re-reading) parallels **iterative development** in design thinking (Alexander [[@alexander1964notet]], Schön). Salvatori's model assumes reading isn't one-pass comprehension but looping engagement that deepens over time.

## Implementation Approach

### How Students Engage

Students read Salvatori's article (~15-20 pages) during Week 3. The guiding questions ask them to:

1. Analyze their own recent difficulty experiences for diagnostic information
2. Distinguish "conversation" from "extraction" models of reading
3. Examine their own text-marking practices as revealing assumptions

These questions make Salvatori's abstract pedagogy immediate: students aren't just learning about difficulty pedagogy, they're practicing it on Salvatori's own text. Meta-layer: if students find Salvatori difficult, that difficulty becomes analyzable using Salvatori's own framework.

### Connection to Course Activities

Week 3 activities include:
- Reading Salvatori (following Ong from Week 2)
- Compression exercise (300→200→100)
- Informal peer feedback on compression
- Literacy Narrative draft development

Students immediately apply Salvatori's framework: when dev logs ask "What was difficult? What did that reveal?" they're enacting Salvatori's difficulty pedagogy. The compression exercise creates intentional difficulty—forcing students to cut text generates decisions about value, priority, and loss. Salvatori's lens makes that difficulty analyzable rather than merely frustrating.

### Ongoing Application

Salvatori's framework recurs throughout the semester:
- **Movement 2** (Naming): When students engage with sources, they identify moments of difficulty/confusion as sites for inquiry
- **Movement 3** (Scale): When corpus management becomes overwhelming, difficulty signals need for new systems
- **Movement 4** (Synthesis): Process Archaeology assignment asks students to analyze their own difficulty patterns over time

## Competing Values & Tradeoffs

### What This Reading Offers

- **Reframes failure**: Transforms deficit narrative into inquiry model
- **Practical strategies**: Provides concrete methods (difficulty papers, marking analysis, recursive reading)
- **Evidence-based**: Salvatori grounds claims in classroom examples, making pedagogy visible

### Potential Challenges

- **Academic register**: Salvatori writes for composition scholars; some terminology may be opaque
- **Discipline-specific examples**: Uses literary texts; students may wonder how this applies to other genres
- **Counterintuitive claim**: Students often resist idea that difficulty is good—goes against schooling norms

### How Design Mitigates Challenges

The course note pre-interprets Salvatori's key concepts (hermeneutical conversation, difficulty as diagnostic, marks-as-method) to reduce terminology load. Guiding questions translate Salvatori's literary examples into students' own writing experiences: "Think about a recent time you found a text difficult..." This generalizes beyond literature.

The Week 3 placement is crucial: students encounter this framework before significant difficulty accumulates, so resistance is lower. If we waited until mid-semester when students were frustrated, the "difficulty is productive" claim would feel dismissive. Early placement makes it a lens for interpreting experience rather than a justification after the fact.

## Evidence & Iteration

### Evidence to Collect

- [ ] Do students use difficulty-as-diagnostic language in dev logs? ("This was hard, which tells me...")
- [ ] When students identify confusion, do they analyze it (what made this confusing?) or just report it?
- [ ] Do students show awareness that where they struggle reveals what matters, not what they lack?
- [ ] In peer review or discussion, do students treat difficulty generously (as information) rather than judgmentally?

### Revision Notes

If students struggle with academic register: consider adding a more accessible secondary text on difficulty (e.g., Lamott's "Shitty First Drafts" as companion piece).

If "difficulty is productive" feels abstract: develop Week 3 activity where students collectively analyze a deliberately difficult text, then reflect on what difficulty revealed.
