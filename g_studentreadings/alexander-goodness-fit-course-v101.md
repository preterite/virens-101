## Context

You'll read Christopher Alexander's [[@alexander1964notet]] "Goodness of Fit" chapter during **Week 7**, the final week of Movement 2 (Naming). You've been working with constraints for several weeks now—genre requirements, source integration rules, word limits, citation formats—and this week you're drafting the Constraint Audit. Alexander introduces the concept of "fit" between form (what you make) and context (what the situation requires), arguing that good design emerges by identifying and resolving "misfits" (places where form and context don't match). This reading helps you see constraints not as arbitrary restrictions but as design requirements that enable fit.

## Description

Alexander argues that design is about achieving "fit" between form (the designed object—a building, a paragraph, a system) and context (the environment or situation it serves). Rather than trying to imagine the perfect form directly, designers should identify *misfits*—specific ways current forms fail to meet contextual requirements. Good design emerges by systematically resolving misfits. Alexander emphasizes that problems are interconnected: fixing one misfit may create others, so designers must understand constraint relationships. The insight: constraints aren't obstacles to overcome but information about what fit requires.

## Guiding Questions

Before you read, consider these questions. Return to them as you engage with Alexander's framework:

1. **Misfits as diagnostic**: Think about a recent writing assignment where something felt "wrong" or didn't work. Using Alexander's language, what was the *misfit*—where did your text (form) fail to meet the situation's requirements (context)? For example: argument too complex for audience, evidence insufficient for claim, organization unclear for purpose. How might identifying specific misfits help you revise more strategically than just feeling something is "off"?

2. **Constraints as relationships**: Alexander emphasizes that constraints are interconnected—changing one affects others. In your writing, can you identify constraint relationships? For example: adding more evidence (to strengthen argument) increases word count (violating length constraint); simplifying language (for accessibility) reduces precision (violating disciplinary expectations). How might understanding these relationships help you make tradeoffs deliberately rather than accidentally?

3. **Fit and context**: Alexander argues form should fit context, not pursue abstract "good design." How does this apply to your fragment corpus? Different fragments serve different contexts (reflective writing, argumentative writing, exploratory writing). What happens when you try to force one fragment type into the wrong context? How might recognizing context help you classify fragments more effectively?
