## Design Rationale

### Why This Reading

Downs's [[@downs2007teaci]] chapter provides accessible, comprehensive introduction to rhetorical concepts that students need for analyzing writing choices throughout the semester. While Ong [[@ong2012writi]] and Salvatori [[@salvatori1996conve]] establish *how* writing and reading work cognitively, Downs establishes *why* we make specific choices in specific situations—the strategic dimension of writing. This vocabulary (audience, purpose, genre, exigence, constraints) enables students to move from "this feels right/wrong" to "this choice serves this purpose in this context."

### Why Week 4 Placement

Week 4 opens Movement 2 (Naming), marking the transition from M1's generative expansion to M2's emphasis on source engagement, classification, and structured feedback. Students have established daily writing habits (Weeks 1-3), read foundational theory (Kirschenbaum, Ong, Salvatori), and now need vocabulary for analyzing their accumulating fragments and the sources they'll engage. Downs arrives precisely when students start asking "What am I supposed to *do* with all these fragments?" Rhetorical vocabulary provides the answer: analyze what each fragment is *trying* to do, for whom, and in what context.

This placement follows constraint sequencing logic: give students (1) writing practice, (2) writing-as-technology framework, (3) difficulty-as-diagnostic framework, (4) vocabulary for strategic analysis—in that order. Rhetorical concepts make more sense after students have writing to analyze and frameworks (Ong's technology, Salvatori's difficulty) for approaching conceptual complexity. As the opening reading of M2, Downs provides the analytical vocabulary students need for the movement's classification and source work.

## Theoretical Grounding

### Composition Pedagogy

Downs's work represents the **Writing About Writing** (WAW) approach, which argues that composition courses should teach students about writing research and theory rather than (or alongside) teaching genres like "the research paper." This course adapts WAW principles: students read composition theory (Ong, Salvatori, Downs) to develop metalanguage for discussing their own practices, making writing processes explicit and transferable.

Rhetorical situation theory (Bitzer [[@bitzer1968rheto]], Bain, later critiqued by Vatz and others) provides the traditional foundation Downs synthesizes. His contribution is making these concepts accessible to first-year students through clear definitions and contemporary examples. The chapter bridges classical rhetoric (Aristotle's appeals, stasis theory) with contemporary composition pedagogy (genre theory, transfer).

Downs's emphasis on **genre as social action** (following Carolyn Miller [[@miller1984genrf]]) connects to the course's systems-thinking approach: genres aren't just forms but patterns that coordinate social activity—a rhetorical parallel to infrastructure (Star [[@star1999ethnp]]) and design patterns (Alexander [[@alexander1964notet]]).

### Systems/Design Thinking

While Downs writes from rhetorical tradition, his framework maps onto systems/design concepts:

- **Rhetorical situation** = **design context** (Alexander, Norman [[@norman2013desig]]). Both emphasize that choices only make sense relative to situations; no universal "good" writing or "good" design exists independent of context.

- **Constraints** (Downs) = **constraints** (Alexander, Norman). Downs's rhetorical constraints (audience expectations, genre conventions, time limits) parallel design constraints (materials, user needs, technical limits). Both traditions treat constraints as productive rather than restrictive.

- **Genre** = **interface pattern**. Genres coordinate shared expectations (readers know what to expect, writers know what to provide), just as interface conventions enable usability without explicit instruction.

## Implementation Approach

### How Students Engage

Students read Downs's chapter (~20-25 pages) during Week 4. The guiding questions ask them to:

1. Identify rhetorical choices in their own recent writing (not just formal essays)
2. Analyze a familiar genre's constraints as both enabling and limiting
3. Consider how writing situation (tools, time, energy) intersects with rhetorical situation

These questions operationalize Downs's concepts by applying them immediately to students' lived experience. Rather than memorizing definitions, students use rhetorical vocabulary as analytical tools.

### Connection to Course Activities

Week 4 activities include:
- Beginning source-based writing (responding to course readings)
- In-class peer feedback on source-based fragments (informal)
- Literacy Narrative revision and submission
- Instructor feedback on Literacy Narratives

Rhetorical vocabulary enables these activities: students can classify fragments by rhetorical purpose (argument, description, analysis, reflection), identify audience assumptions, and recognize genre patterns. Downs provides the conceptual toolkit for the classification and source engagement work that defines Movement 2.

### Ongoing Application

Rhetorical concepts recur throughout the semester:
- **Movement 2** (Naming): Explicit rhetorical analysis of sources using BEAM framework
- **Movement 3** (Scale): Genre awareness becomes crucial for transforming fragments into polished pieces
- **Movement 4** (Synthesis): Portfolio requires rhetorical choices about audience, purpose, arrangement

## Competing Values & Tradeoffs

### What This Reading Offers

- **Accessible vocabulary**: Downs writes for first-year students; concepts are clearly defined
- **Contemporary examples**: Uses familiar communication contexts (social media, email, texts)
- **Transfer-oriented**: Emphasizes concepts applicable across contexts, not just academic writing

### Potential Challenges

- **Length**: At 20-25 pages, this is a longer reading; may feel overwhelming in Week 4
- **Terminology density**: Introduces many terms at once (exigence, kairos, audience, purpose, genre, constraints)
- **Disciplinary origins**: Some students resist "English class jargon"; may not see immediate utility

### How Design Mitigates Challenges

The course note pre-organizes key terms and provides a conceptual anchor ("strategic communication in context"), reducing cognitive load. Guiding questions immediately apply concepts to students' own practices, demonstrating utility. Week 4 timing helps: students have enough writing experience (3 weeks) to see why rhetorical vocabulary matters, but aren't overwhelmed yet by competing demands.

The third guiding question explicitly connects rhetoric to the course's systems emphasis: "writing situation" parallels "rhetorical situation," validating that tool choices and time management matter rhetorically, not just practically. This bridges Downs's traditional rhetoric with the course's innovation.

## Evidence & Iteration

### Evidence to Collect

- [ ] Do students use rhetorical vocabulary accurately in dev logs, peer review, reflections?
- [ ] When analyzing writing choices, do students reference situation/audience/purpose rather than just "good" vs. "bad"?
- [ ] Do students demonstrate transfer: applying rhetorical concepts to non-academic writing?
- [ ] In classification activities, can students articulate rhetorical differences between fragment types?

### Revision Notes

If length is prohibitive: consider excerpting (first half covers core concepts; second half extends to professional/civic contexts). Could assign first half required, second half optional.

If terminology overwhelms: develop Week 4 activity where students collaboratively define terms through examples before reading Downs, then read to confirm/complicate their definitions.
