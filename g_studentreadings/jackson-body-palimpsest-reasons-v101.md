## Design Rationale

### Why This Reading

Jackson's [[@jackson1997body-a]] experimental hypertext essay provides a _model_ of the course's core innovation: accumulation-over-episodes, connection-as-meaning-making, and the palimpsest metaphor for layered writing. While theory readings explain these principles abstractly, Jackson enacts them in creative form. Seeing accumulation-as-composition in practice helps students imagine what their own fragment-to-portfolio arc might produce.

This reading is crucial for students who struggle with the course's non-traditional structure. When asked "where's the essay assignment?", Jackson's work demonstrates that accumulation and connection can produce sophisticated composition without traditional five-paragraph structure. It's an existence proof that the course's methods work.

### Why Week 6 Placement

Week 6 falls in the middle of Movement 2 (Naming), when students have been classifying fragments, engaging sources, and receiving initial structured peer feedback. They've accumulated material and begun organizing it but may not yet see how it coheres. Jackson arrives alongside the Library of Babel composite, pairing a conceptual framework about classification and scale with a concrete creative model of accumulation-as-composition.

This placement follows constraint sequencing: students need to have accumulated and begun organizing fragments before Jackson's example makes sense. Earlier placement (Week 3-4) would be premature—students wouldn't have material to work with. Week 6 shows them what accumulated, connected work might become while they're still in the thick of source engagement and classification work.

## Theoretical Grounding

### Composition Pedagogy

Jackson's work connects to **hypertext theory** (Landow, Bolter) and **electronic literature** studies, which examined how digital affordances enable new compositional forms. Her "My Body" demonstrates that meaning emerges from connection structures, not just linear progression—a principle central to network-based composition pedagogy.

The **palimpsest metaphor** has rich history in composition studies (Fleischer, Yancey [[@yancey1998refle]]) for describing revision as layering rather than replacement. Jackson literalizes this: her text explicitly shows traces of multiple perspectives, times, and voices coexisting. This supports the course's emphasis on preserving process documentation—earlier layers remain valuable, not just as history but as co-present meaning.

Jackson's **accumulation strategy** enacts the course's "accumulation over episodes" principle. Traditional composition pedagogy assumes discrete assignments producing discrete products; Jackson shows composition can be accumulative, where fragments connect to form complex wholes without losing their fragment-identity.

### Systems/Design Thinking

Jackson's essay embodies several systems-thinking principles:

- **Emergence through connection**: Meaning emerges from how fragments connect, not from fragments' inherent properties. This parallels network theory (nodes + edges create structure) and Alexander's [[@alexander1964notet]] pattern languages (patterns + relationships create designs).

- **Multiple entry points**: Hypertext structure allows readers to start anywhere, follow different paths. This maps onto the course's non-linear progression—students don't move through rigid sequence but navigate according to need.

- **Layered visibility**: Palimpsest structure makes multiple layers simultaneously visible. This parallels version control (seeing file history) and infrastructure studies (making invisible systems visible through failure or analysis).

Jackson's form also connects to **database logic** (Manovich): composition as curating/connecting fragments from a corpus rather than producing linear text from blank page. This is exactly the compositional logic the course teaches.

## Implementation Approach

### How Students Engage

Students read Jackson's essay (~20 pages, though hypertext structure makes "length" ambiguous) during Week 6, mid-Movement 2. The guiding questions ask them to:

1. Compare Jackson's fragment-connection method to their own accumulation practices
2. Consider how form shapes meaning (nonlinear vs. linear organization)
3. Apply palimpsest metaphor to their own corpus (visible layers)

These questions explicitly connect Jackson's creative example to students' ongoing work. Rather than analyzing Jackson as a separate literary object, students use her methods as a mirror for reflecting on their practices.

### Connection to Course Activities

Week 6 activities include:
- Spec Document development and peer review (Eli Review Cycle 2)
- Constraint Audit brainstorming
- Continued classification and fragment work

Jackson provides inspiration alongside ongoing M2 work: as students classify and connect fragments, Jackson's model demonstrates that connection-making itself is compositional—not just preliminary organization but meaning-making. When students later face the challenge of "what do I do with all these fragments?", they can remember Jackson's model—connect them, layer them, let meaning emerge from relationships.

### Ongoing Application

Jackson's example recurs throughout the semester:
- **Movement 3** (Scale): Students practice connection-making at larger scale, informed by Jackson's methods
- **Movement 4** (Synthesis): Portfolio assembly requires curating/connecting accumulated work—exactly Jackson's compositional strategy
- **Process Archaeology**: Students analyze their own palimpsest (layers of drafts, abandoned experiments, evolving thinking)

## Competing Values & Tradeoffs

### What This Reading Offers

- **Concrete model**: Shows accumulation/connection producing finished work
- **Formal innovation**: Experimental structure demonstrates alternatives to traditional essay form
- **Bridge reading**: Creative/literary work accessible to students who resist theory

### Potential Challenges

- **Form resistance**: Students may dismiss hypertext/creative writing as not "real" composition
- **Hypertext format**: If reading PDF version (not interactive), loses some structural insight
- **Genre transfer**: Students may wonder how Jackson's poetic methods apply to academic writing

### How Design Mitigates Challenges

The course note explicitly frames Jackson as _modeling course principles_ (accumulation, connection, layers), not as literary curiosity. Guiding questions continuously connect Jackson's methods to students' practices: "How does this compare to your fragment accumulation?"

Week 6 placement helps: students have been practicing fragment accumulation for 6 weeks, so Jackson's methods feel continuous with their work rather than alien. The third guiding question names the connection: "Can you think of your writing corpus as a palimpsest...?"

If hypertext format is inaccessible, can supplement with Jackson's "Skin" project (online interactive version) to show hypertext structure in action.

## Evidence & Iteration

### Evidence to Collect

- [ ] Do students adopt connection-making language (network, links, associations) in discussing their work?
- [ ] When facing corpus organization challenges (Movement 3), do students reference Jackson's model?
- [ ] In Portfolio assembly, do students demonstrate awareness that connection patterns create meaning?
- [ ] Do students show comfort with non-linear, accumulative composition strategies?

### Revision Notes

If hypertext format is crucial but inaccessible: schedule computer lab session to experience interactive version, or create simplified hypertext activity using course materials.

If genre transfer feels unclear: develop Week 6 activity where students create mini-connections-map of their own fragments, experimenting with Jackson-style associative linking.
