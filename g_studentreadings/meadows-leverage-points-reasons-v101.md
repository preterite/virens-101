## Design Rationale

### Why This Reading

Meadows [[@meadows2008lever]] provides the foundational systems-thinking framework for the entire course. Her leverage points concept helps students understand _why_ the course emphasizes certain interventions (constraint sequencing, process documentation, tool choices) over others (more time, more effort, more drafts). Without systems vocabulary, students may experience course innovations as arbitrary requirements; with it, they can analyze their own writing systems strategically.

This reading is crucial for justifying the course's emphasis on infrastructure over content: changing _when_ constraints arrive (high leverage) matters more than adding _more_ constraints (low leverage). Meadows explains why the course's unusual structure—fragment accumulation, delayed correction, process-first—might work better than traditional approaches despite feeling counterintuitive.

### Why Week 5 Placement

Week 5 falls mid-Movement 2 (Naming), when students are actively organizing fragments and experiencing the course's systematic approach to classification and documentation. They've accumulated enough experience (5 weeks) to recognize patterns in their own behavior but haven't yet invested so heavily in current methods that changing approach feels threatening.

This placement follows constraint sequencing: students need to _experience_ writing-as-system (through fragment accumulation, documentation requirements, tool choices) before systems-thinking vocabulary makes sense. Week 5 provides enough distance from Week 1 chaos to enable pattern recognition while maintaining enough semester to implement insights.

### Difficulty Pair B (with Star)

Meadows is one half of **Difficulty Pair B** (Meadows + Star [[@star1999ethnp]], "Seeing Invisible Systems"). Students encounter these readings with a 5-week gap:

- **Meadows (Week 5)**: Systems have leverage points—vocabulary for describing stocks, flows, feedback loops, and places where intervention matters most
- **Star (Week 10)**: Infrastructure becomes visible only through breakdown—ethnographic method for studying systems designed to be invisible

The thematic connection: both ask students to **see things that are designed to be invisible**. Meadows gives vocabulary for describing systems operating all around you; Star gives a method for noticing structures that have become so successful they've disappeared into the background. The 5-week gap creates productive distance—students develop systems vocabulary (Meadows), build substantial writing infrastructure through Movements 2-3, then encounter Star's framework for analyzing the very systems they've been building without noticing.

## Theoretical Grounding

### Composition Pedagogy

Meadows connects to **process pedagogy** (Murray [[@murray1972teach]], Elbow [[@elbow1973writi]], Sommers) by treating writing as dynamic system rather than static product. Traditional process pedagogy identified recursive stages (prewriting, drafting, revising) but often lacked framework for understanding _why_ certain interventions work. Meadows provides that framework: feedback loops, delays, leverage points explain process dynamics.

The concept of **metacognition** in composition studies parallels Meadows's systems analysis: both ask students to examine their own processes from a distance. But Meadows adds analytical vocabulary: instead of vague "reflect on your process," students can ask "where are my feedback loops? What delays exist? What leverage points might shift behavior?"

**Transfer pedagogy** benefits from systems thinking: if students understand writing as system (with goals, constraints, feedback loops), they can apply that analytical frame across contexts rather than learning domain-specific rules. Meadows's leverage points become portable heuristic for process improvement.

### Systems/Design Thinking

Meadows's essay is canonical systems thinking (cited across disciplines from ecology to organizational management). Her leverage points hierarchy synthesizes cybernetics (feedback loops), systems dynamics (stocks/flows, delays), and intervention theory (where to act for maximum effect).

The hierarchy from weak to strong leverage points:
- **Numbers** (parameters): Working harder, more time (low leverage)
- **Buffers** (stabilizing stocks): Building fragment corpus
- **Stock-and-flow structures**: Accumulation vs. production rates
- **Delays**: Time between writing and feedback
- **Feedback loops**: How outputs become inputs
- **Information flows**: What data is visible when
- **Rules**: Constraints and affordances
- **Self-organization**: System's ability to evolve
- **Goals**: What the system optimizes for
- **Paradigms**: Fundamental assumptions (highest leverage)

The course targets high-leverage interventions: changing feedback timing (peer review structure), shifting goals (accumulation over episodes), paradigm shift (writing-as-system not writing-as-product).

## Implementation Approach

### How Students Engage

Students read Meadows's essay (~15-20 pages) during Week 5, mid-Movement 2. The guiding questions ask them to:

1. Analyze past improvement attempts using leverage points hierarchy
2. Map their writing process's feedback loops and delays
3. Identify paradigm shift the course asks them to make

These questions operationalize systems thinking by applying it immediately to students' experiences. Rather than learning systems theory abstractly, students use Meadows as diagnostic tool for their own practices.

### Connection to Course Activities

Week 5 activities include:
- Active peer review through Eli Review (feedback intervention)
- Source classification using BEAM framework (information flows)
- Dev log entries documenting process (making system visible)

Meadows provides intellectual framework for understanding why these activities matter: peer review changes feedback timing (high leverage), BEAM framework makes information flows explicit, dev logs enable system visibility necessary for analysis and intervention.

### Ongoing Application

Meadows's framework recurs throughout the semester:

- **Movement 2**: Constraint sequencing is leverage point strategy—changing _when_ constraints arrive (high leverage) vs. what constraints are (lower leverage)
- **Movement 3**: Scale challenges require structural interventions (reorganization, consolidation) not just effort (working harder)
- **Movement 4**: Process Archaeology asks students to identify what leverage points they discovered through trial and error

The leverage points concept becomes analytical tool students can apply beyond the course: when facing writing challenges, ask "what leverage point am I trying to change?"

## Competing Values & Tradeoffs

### What This Reading Offers

- **Analytical vocabulary**: Specific concepts (feedback, delays, leverage) for examining processes
- **Counterintuitive insights**: Working harder is low-leverage; changing goals is high-leverage
- **Cross-domain applicability**: Systems thinking transfers across contexts

### Potential Challenges

- **Abstract concepts**: Systems thinking is conceptually demanding; students may struggle with vocabulary
- **Non-writing context**: Meadows writes about environmental/social systems; connection to writing may feel unclear
- **Complexity**: Twelve leverage points with hierarchical relationships = cognitive load

### How Design Mitigates Challenges

The course note pre-organizes key concepts (feedback loops, delays, leverage hierarchy) to reduce terminology load. Guiding questions immediately apply systems concepts to writing: "where do you receive feedback?" "what are your goals?" This grounds abstraction in lived experience.

Week 5 timing is crucial: students have enough process experience (5 weeks) to map Meadows's concepts onto their own practices. The course's systematic structure (fragment accumulation, documentation requirements) provides concrete examples of systems thinking in action—students aren't learning theory in vacuum.

The first guiding question validates students' prior improvement attempts while introducing leverage thinking: "Did it work?" Many students have tried low-leverage interventions (more time, better environment); Meadows explains why these often disappoint and what alternatives exist.

## Evidence & Iteration

### Evidence to Collect

- [ ] Do students use systems vocabulary (feedback, delays, leverage) in dev logs and reflections?
- [ ] When proposing process changes, do students articulate which leverage point they're targeting?
- [ ] In Process Archaeology, can students identify high vs. low leverage interventions they attempted?
- [ ] Do students demonstrate understanding that system structure shapes behavior (not just individual effort)?

### Revision Notes

If systems vocabulary overwhelms: consider adding visual diagram of leverage points hierarchy, or create simplified "three levels" version (parameters/structure/paradigms).

If writing connection feels unclear: develop Week 5 activity where students map their writing process as system diagram (feedback loops, delays, goals) before reading Meadows.
