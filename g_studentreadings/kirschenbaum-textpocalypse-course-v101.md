## Context

You'll read Kirschenbaum's [[@kirschenbaum2023prepa]] "Prepare for the Textpocalypse" during **Week 1** of Movement 1 (Surfacing), as part of the course's orientation to writing-as-technology. Kirschenbaum extends the insight that writing is technology by examining the material conditions of digital writing: what happens to meaning when text becomes bits? When files corrupt, formats become obsolete, or platforms disappear? This reading establishes the foundational frame for the entire course—that _how_ we create, store, and organize writing is not trivial housekeeping but fundamental to what writing can mean and do.

## Description

Kirschenbaum argues that we're living through a moment of profound instability in textual media. Digital text feels permanent (never degrades like paper) yet is radically fragile (depends on software, hardware, formats that constantly change). He examines how different storage media and file formats shape what writing can be and do, from ASCII's limitations to Word's invisibility of formatting codes to blockchain's distributed permanence. The essay makes visible the infrastructure of digital writing—the stuff we usually ignore until something breaks.

## Guiding Questions

Before you read, consider these questions. Return to them as you engage with Kirschenbaum's argument:

1. **Materiality and survival**: Kirschenbaum describes scenarios where digital texts become unreadable (file formats obsolete, platforms defunct, passwords lost). Before you've experienced this in the course, consider: Have you ever lost access to writing you created? A file that wouldn't open? A platform that disappeared? An account you got locked out of? What was lost—just the text, or also the context that made it meaningful? How does this connect to why the course will emphasize plain text files, consistent naming, and organized storage from the start?

2. **Visible vs. invisible infrastructure**: When you currently write (in Word, Google Docs, Notes app, social media), what's happening "under the hood" that you don't see or think about? File formats? Auto-save? Cloud sync? How might those invisible systems affect what you can do with your writing later? What would you want to know about these systems *before* committing your writing to them?

3. **Writing as system, not just documents**: Kirschenbaum treats writing not as individual documents but as systems (files + software + hardware + formats + backups). Over the next 15 weeks, you'll build a writing system for this course—fragments, folders, tools, workflows. If you were designing this system from scratch, knowing that digital text is both powerful and fragile, what would matter most to you? Accessibility? Durability? Portability? Ease of use? How might those values conflict?
