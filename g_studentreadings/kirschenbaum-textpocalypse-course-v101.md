## Context

You'll read Kirschenbaum's "Prepare for the Textpocalypse" during **Week 4** of Movement 2 (Naming), as we shift focus to organizing and working with your accumulated fragments. Kirschenbaum extends Ong's [[@ong2012writi]] insight that writing is technology by examining the material conditions of digital writing: what happens to meaning when text becomes bits? When files corrupt, formats become obsolete, or platforms disappear? This reading grounds the course's emphasis on file management, backup systems, and documentation—making visible that _how_ we store and organize writing is not trivial housekeeping but fundamental to meaning-making.

## Description

Kirschenbaum argues that we're living through a moment of profound instability in textual media. Digital text feels permanent (never degrades like paper) yet is radically fragile (depends on software, hardware, formats that constantly change). He examines how different storage media and file formats shape what writing can be and do, from ASCII's limitations to Word's invisibility of formatting codes to blockchain's distributed permanence. The essay makes visible the infrastructure of digital writing—the stuff we usually ignore until something breaks.

## Guiding Questions

Before you read, consider these questions. Return to them as you engage with Kirschenbaum's argument:

1. **Materiality and access**: Kirschenbaum describes scenarios where digital texts become unreadable (file formats obsolete, platforms defunct, passwords lost). Can you think of writing you've created that you can no longer access? What was lost—just convenience, or something more fundamental about what that writing meant or could do? How does this connect to the course's emphasis on plain text, consistent file naming, and organized folder structures?

2. **Visible vs. invisible infrastructure**: When you write in Word or Google Docs, what's happening "under the hood" that you don't see? Formatting codes? Version history? File sync? Auto-save? How might making this infrastructure visible change how you think about writing tools? What happens when invisible systems fail?

3. **Writing as system**: Kirschenbaum treats writing not as individual documents but as systems (files + software + hardware + formats + backups). How does this connect to the course's fragment accumulation approach? What parts of _your_ writing system are visible to you? What parts are invisible until something goes wrong?
