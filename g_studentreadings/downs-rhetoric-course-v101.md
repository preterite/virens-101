## Context

You'll read this excerpt from Doug Downs during **Week 3** of Movement 1 (Surfacing), as we transition from building writing habits to examining how writing works in different contexts. Downs provides accessible definitions of core rhetorical concepts—rhetoric, audience, purpose, context, genre—that you'll use throughout the semester. This reading establishes a shared vocabulary for discussing *why* writing choices matter, not just *what* those choices are.

---

## Description

Downs explains rhetoric as "the strategic use of language and symbols to achieve goals in specific situations." Rather than treating rhetoric as manipulation or empty speech, Downs shows it as fundamental to all human communication: whenever we make choices about what to say, how to say it, and to whom, we're engaging in rhetoric. The chapter introduces key terms (audience, purpose, exigence, constraints, genre) and demonstrates how these concepts help us analyze both what writers do and why those choices succeed or fail in particular contexts.

## Guiding Questions

Before you read, consider these questions. Return to them as you engage with Downs's argument:

1. **Rhetoric in practice**: Downs argues that rhetoric isn't just about "fancy" or "persuasive" language—it's about strategic communication in context. Think about a recent text you wrote (email, text message, social media post, essay draft). What rhetorical choices did you make, even if you didn't think of them as "rhetorical" at the time? How did audience, purpose, or context shape your choices?

2. **Genre as constraint**: Downs describes genres as patterns that both enable and constrain communication. Consider a genre you know well (lab report, cover letter, grocery list, Instagram caption). What does that genre *require*? What does it *forbid*? How do these constraints help you communicate effectively in that situation, and when might they get in the way?

3. **Rhetorical situation vs. writing situation**: This course emphasizes your "writing situation" (tools, time, energy, constraints) as much as the "rhetorical situation" (audience, purpose, context). How might understanding your writing situation—when you write, what tools you use, how much time you have—be as important as understanding your audience? What happens when these two situations conflict?
