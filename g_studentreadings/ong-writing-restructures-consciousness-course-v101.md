## Context

You'll read this short excerpt from Walter Ong's [[@ong2012writi]] _Orality and Literacy_ during **Week 2** of Movement 1 (Surfacing). We're early in the semester, still building your daily writing practice and accumulating fragments. Ong helps us see writing not as a transparent medium for expressing pre-existing thoughts, but as a technology that fundamentally changes how we think. This frames the course's approach to writing-as-system: writing doesn't just record ideas—it creates them.

---

## Description

Ong argues that writing is a technology (like a hammer or a computer) that "restructures consciousness." When cultures shift from oral to literate, they don't just gain a new tool for recording speech—they develop entirely different ways of thinking. Writing creates distance between the knower and the known, allows for analysis and reflection, and makes thought visible and manipulable. What feels "natural" about writing is actually learned and artificial. This insight is foundational for understanding how the tools and systems we use for writing shape what and how we think.

## Guiding Questions

Before you read, consider these questions. Return to them as you engage with Ong's argument:

1. **Technology and consciousness**: Ong claims writing is a technology that changes how we think, not just what we think about. Can you identify a specific tool or system you use for writing (index cards, word processor, notes app) that has changed _how_ you think about ideas, not just helped you record them? What changed?

2. **Distance and analysis**: Ong suggests writing creates "distance" that enables analysis. When you write something down versus just thinking about it, what becomes possible that wasn't before? What might this tell us about why the course emphasizes making your writing process visible through documentation?

3. **Naturalness and learning**: If what feels "natural" about writing is actually artificial—learned through practice and training—what implications might this have for how you approach difficulty in your own writing? How does this connect to the course's principle that difficulty is diagnostic information rather than failure?
