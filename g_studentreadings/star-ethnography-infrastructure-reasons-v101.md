## Design Rationale

### Why This Reading

Star provides the conceptual framework for understanding why the course emphasizes making writing infrastructure visible: file systems, naming conventions, folder structures, dev logs, process documentation. Without Star's framework, students may experience these requirements as busywork ("why does the instructor care about my file names?"). With it, they understand that infrastructure invisibility prevents learning and transfer—you can't improve or adapt systems you don't consciously recognize.

This reading is crucial for the transition from Movement 3 to Movement 4. Students have built substantial writing infrastructure over 11 weeks; Star helps them recognize it as infrastructure (not just "how I happen to do things") and prepares them for Process Archaeology, which asks them to document and analyze their invisible systems.

### Why Week 10 Placement

Week 10 falls mid-Movement 3 (Operating at Scale), when students have been managing substantial corpora and experiencing infrastructure challenges (retrieval problems, version confusion, organizational breakdown). They've built systems through necessity but may not have recognized them as *systems*. Star arrives precisely when students can map her concepts onto lived experience.

This placement follows constraint sequencing: students need to *build* infrastructure before they can *analyze* it. Week 10 provides enough accumulated experience (10 weeks of file management, documentation, organization) that Star's abstraction lands on concrete examples. Too early (Week 3-4), students wouldn't have infrastructure to examine; Week 10 provides both experience and runway for the Process Archaeology to come.

### Difficulty Pair A (with Salvatori)

Star is one half of **Difficulty Pair A** (Salvatori + Star, "Visibility/Surfacing"). Students who choose Pair A complete difficulty entries on both readings:

- **Salvatori (Week 3)**: Difficulty makes reading processes visible—what's hard reveals where cognitive work is happening
- **Star (Week 10)**: Infrastructure studies make invisible systems visible—breakdown reveals what was always present but unnoticed

The thematic connection: both treat **invisibility as the default state** and use difficulty/failure as the method for surfacing hidden structures. The 7-week gap between readings creates productive distance—students develop Salvatori's individual-cognitive framework, then apply Star's systemic-social framework. Conference week (Week 9) falls between them, providing a natural moment to reflect on how Salvatori's visibility thinking might preview Star's infrastructure analysis.

## Theoretical Grounding

### Composition Pedagogy

Star's work connects to **critical consciousness** in composition pedagogy (Berlin, Bizzell): making invisible ideologies and systems explicit enables critique and agency. Just as critical pedagogy asks students to examine power structures in discourse, Star asks them to examine infrastructure structures that shape practice.

The concept of **transfer** in writing studies directly parallels Star's infrastructure insights: transfer fails when students treat genre conventions or rhetorical strategies as content (to memorize) rather than infrastructure (to adapt). Star explains why making infrastructure explicit (through metacognitive reflection, genre analysis, process documentation) enables transfer—you can't adapt what you don't recognize.

**Activity theory** (Russell, Prior) treats writing as situated within activity systems where tools mediate practice. Star's infrastructure analysis operationalizes this: tools aren't neutral instruments but infrastructure with politics, affordances, and breakdowns. The course's systematic tool introduction (index cards, Word, Zotero, Eli) becomes infrastructure-building, not just skill-training.

### Systems/Design Thinking

Star's infrastructure theory is foundational in Science and Technology Studies (STS) and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). Key concepts:

- **Relational nature**: Infrastructure isn't inherent property but relation between system and practice. This parallels Norman's situated action—design elements become affordances or constraints depending on user goals and context.

- **Visibility through breakdown**: Infrastructure failure makes systems explicit. This connects to Meadows's leverage points (understanding system structure enables intervention) and to engineering failure analysis (breakdowns reveal dependencies).

- **Standards and classifications**: Infrastructure depends on shared standards (Star & Bowker's *Sorting Things Out*). This connects to genre theory (genres as standards enabling coordination) and to the course's emphasis on consistent naming conventions and folder structures.

- **Embedded in other structures**: Infrastructure nests within infrastructure. The course demonstrates this: Word depends on file systems, which depend on operating systems, which depend on hardware. Each layer can fail independently.

## Implementation Approach

### How Students Engage

Students read Star's essay (~20-25 pages) during Week 10, paired with Bush's "Memex." The guiding questions ask them to:

1. Recall infrastructure breakdowns and what they revealed
2. Identify writing infrastructure that's become invisible through habituation
3. Connect infrastructure visibility to learning and transfer challenges

These questions operationalize Star's theoretical insights by grounding them in students' semester-long experiences. Rather than treating infrastructure as abstract concept, students map it onto their filing systems, their dev logs, their organizational challenges.

### Connection to Course Activities

Week 11 activities include:
- Final consolidation of Movement 3 corpus work
- Planning for Process Archaeology assignment (Movement 4)
- Reflecting on organizational evolution over semester

Star provides intellectual framework for Process Archaeology: documenting the infrastructure you built isn't narcissistic navel-gazing but essential work for understanding how systems enable (or constrain) practice. The assignment asks students to make their invisible infrastructure visible so they can learn from it and adapt it to new contexts.

### Ongoing Application

Star's framework directly informs Movement 4 work:

- **Process Archaeology**: Explicitly documents writing infrastructure developed over semester
- **Portfolio assembly**: Requires explaining your organizational system to readers who don't share your infrastructure
- **Transfer reflection**: Asks how infrastructure built for this course might adapt to other contexts

The final portfolio cover letter functions like Star's ethnographic analysis: making infrastructure visible through description and reflection.

## Competing Values & Tradeoffs

### What This Reading Offers

- **Legitimizes infrastructure focus**: Elevates file management and organization to intellectually significant work
- **Explains invisibility**: Why students don't notice their own systems until problems arise
- **Transfer framework**: Infrastructure visibility enables adaptation to new contexts

### Potential Challenges

- **Academic register**: Star writes for STS scholars; terminology (embeddedness, relationality, standardization) can be dense
- **Abstract concepts**: Infrastructure as theoretical concept vs. concrete filing systems
- **Late-semester timing**: Week 11 fatigue may reduce engagement with demanding reading

### How Design Mitigates Challenges

The course note pre-interprets key concepts (infrastructure as relational, visibility through breakdown, learning contexts) in accessible language. Guiding questions immediately connect Star's abstractions to students' concrete experiences: "Can you recall a moment when one of your writing systems failed?"

Week 11 timing, while late, is strategically optimal: students have maximum experiential grounding for Star's concepts and immediate application (Process Archaeology). The reading prepares students for portfolio work by explaining *why* documenting invisible systems matters—not just that the assignment requires it.

The first guiding question normalizes breakdown: everyone has experienced system failure, so Star's analysis validates shared experience rather than introducing alien concepts.

## Evidence & Iteration

### Evidence to Collect

- [ ] Do students use infrastructure vocabulary (breakdown, visibility, relationality) in Process Archaeology?
- [ ] Can students identify specific infrastructure they built and when it became invisible?
- [ ] Do students articulate how making infrastructure visible supports transfer?
- [ ] In portfolio reflections, do students demonstrate awareness that organizational systems shape practice?

### Revision Notes

If academic register creates barriers: consider supplementing with more accessible infrastructure examples (highway systems, electrical grids, internet protocols) before reading Star.

If timing feels too early: could move to Week 11, gaining one more week of infrastructure-building experience before analysis.

If connection to writing feels unclear: develop Week 10 activity where students collaboratively map their writing infrastructure (tools, systems, standards, breakdowns) before reading Star to confirm/complicate their maps.
