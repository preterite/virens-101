## Context

You'll read Shelley Jackson's experimental hypertext essay during **Week 7** of Movement 2 (Naming), near the end of the movement as you're consolidating your work with sources and preparing to move into Movement 3's focus on scale. Jackson provides a striking example of writing-as-accumulation: a text built from layers, fragments, and connections rather than linear argument. This reading models what the course asks you to do—accumulate fragments, then transform them through connection and layering.

---

## Description

Jackson's "My Body—A Wunderkammer" (German for "cabinet of curiosities") presents her body as a collection of stories, each body part linked to memories, observations, and reflections. The essay accumulates fragments about skin, bones, organs, and scars, connecting them through associative rather than logical links. Originally published as hypertext (readers click between fragments), it demonstrates how meaning emerges from connection patterns rather than linear progression. Jackson's palimpsest metaphor (writing surface that shows traces of previous writing) captures how texts—and bodies, and selves—are layered accumulations, not unified wholes.

## Guiding Questions

Before you read, consider these questions. Return to them as you engage with Jackson's experimental form:

1. **Accumulation and connection**: Jackson builds her essay by accumulating fragments about different body parts, then connecting them through links and associations. How does this compare to your fragment accumulation process? What happens when you try to connect fragments that seem unrelated—do new meanings emerge? What kinds of connections create meaning versus just create collections?

2. **Form and content**: Jackson's hypertext form (clickable, nonlinear) embodies her argument that bodies and identities are fragmentary rather than unified. How might the *form* of your writing shape what you can mean, not just how you say it? When you organize fragments into linear essay structure, what gets gained and what gets lost compared to keeping them as a connected network?

3. **Palimpsest and layers**: A palimpsest is a writing surface that shows traces of erased previous writing—layers visible through each other. Can you think of your writing corpus as a palimpsest, where earlier fragments and abandoned experiments remain visible beneath later work? Why might preserving these layers (through version control, dev logs, saved drafts) be valuable rather than just keeping the final "clean" version?
