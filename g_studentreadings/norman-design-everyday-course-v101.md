## Context

You'll read the first chapter of Donald Norman's *The Design of Everyday Things* during **Week 12** at the start of Movement 4 (Synthesis), just as you begin the Process Archaeology assignment. Norman introduces key design concepts—affordances, signifiers, constraints, feedback—that help you analyze the tools and systems you've built over the semester. This reading provides vocabulary for examining *why* certain writing tools worked well (or poorly) and *how* design choices shaped your writing behavior.

## Description

Norman argues that good design makes correct actions obvious and incorrect actions difficult—not through complexity but through thoughtful attention to how humans perceive and act. He introduces four key concepts: **Affordances** (what actions objects enable), **Signifiers** (cues that communicate affordances), **Constraints** (what actions objects prevent), and **Feedback** (information about action results). Norman shows that "user error" is usually design error: when people struggle with doors, faucets, or stoves, the problem isn't user stupidity but poor communication of how things work. Good design makes the right action the natural action.

## Guiding Questions

Before you read, consider these questions. Return to them as you engage with Norman's framework:

1. **Affordances and constraints**: Think about the writing tools you've used this semester—index cards, Word documents, Zotero, Eli Review. What actions did each tool *afford* (make possible/easy) and what actions did each tool *constrain* (make difficult/impossible)? For example: index cards afford quick capture but constrain long-form writing; Word affords formatting but constrains version visibility. How did these affordances and constraints shape what you wrote and how you wrote it?

2. **Signifiers and discoverability**: Norman distinguishes affordances (what's possible) from signifiers (clues about what's possible). Looking at your folder structure or file naming system, what signifiers did you create to help yourself (or others) understand how to use your system? When you return to your corpus after time away, what clues help you remember what files contain or where things are? What happens when signifiers are missing or misleading?

3. **Feedback loops**: Norman emphasizes that actions need immediate, clear feedback. In your writing process, where do you get feedback—from yourself (reading back), from peers (Eli Review), from tools (word count, spellcheck)? How quickly does feedback arrive after actions? How might feedback timing shape your writing behavior? When feedback is delayed or unclear, what happens to your process?
