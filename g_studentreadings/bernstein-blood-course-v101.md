## Context

You'll read Charles Bernstein's essay during **Week 13** of Movement 4 (Synthesis), as you complete Process Archaeology and assemble your final portfolio. Bernstein writes about poetry composition, but his insights about revision as meaning-making (not error-correction) apply to all writing. This reading arrives when you're making critical decisions about what to include in your portfolio and what to leave behind—Bernstein validates that the "cutting room floor" (discarded material, failed experiments, abandoned drafts) is as much a part of your intellectual work as what survives in the final portfolio.

---

## Description

Bernstein argues that revision isn't about "fixing" drafts to match a pre-existing ideal. Instead, revision *creates* meaning through cutting, rearranging, and transforming material. The "blood" in his title references both the difficulty of cutting your own writing and the idea that what gets cut reveals as much about the writing process as what remains. Bernstein emphasizes that failed experiments, abandoned directions, and discarded fragments are valuable evidence of thinking-in-process, not just waste products.

## Guiding Questions

Before you read, consider these questions. Return to them as you engage with Bernstein's argument:

1. **Revision as discovery**: Bernstein suggests revision isn't about "fixing" mistakes but discovering what you're trying to say. As you decide what fragments, drafts, and experiments to include in your portfolio, when does cutting or excluding something reveal what you actually want to say? How might the *act* of choosing what to leave out help you discover your portfolio's argument?

2. **The cutting room floor as evidence**: Process Archaeology asks you to document what you tried, what you abandoned, and what you learned from failure. Bernstein argues that discarded material reveals as much about the writing process as finished work. Looking at your semester's "cutting room floor"—what you drafted but didn't use, what you tried but abandoned—what does this material reveal about how your thinking evolved? Why might this matter for understanding your development as a writer?

3. **Permission flags and curation**: Bernstein emphasizes that the *work* of revision—deciding what to cut, what to keep, what to transform—is where meaning gets made. Your portfolio requires permission flags: explicit decisions about what gets published, what stays private, what gets acknowledged but not shown. How does Bernstein's framework help you think about these curation decisions as intellectual work, not just housekeeping?
