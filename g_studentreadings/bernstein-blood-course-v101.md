## Context

You'll read Charles Bernstein's essay during **Week 6** of Movement 2 (Naming), when you're actively working with sources and transforming fragments through structured peer review. Bernstein writes about poetry composition, but his insights about revision as meaning-making (not error-correction) apply to all writing. This reading arrives when you're experiencing revision as labor-intensive work—Bernstein validates that the "cutting room floor" (discarded material, failed experiments) is as much a part of writing as what survives in final drafts.

---

## Description

Bernstein argues that revision isn't about "fixing" drafts to match a pre-existing ideal. Instead, revision *creates* meaning through cutting, rearranging, and transforming material. The "blood" in his title references both the difficulty of cutting your own writing and the idea that what gets cut reveals as much about the writing process as what remains. Bernstein emphasizes that failed experiments, abandoned directions, and discarded fragments are valuable evidence of thinking-in-process, not just waste products.

## Guiding Questions

Before you read, consider these questions. Return to them as you engage with Bernstein's argument:

1. **Revision as discovery**: Bernstein suggests revision isn't about "fixing" mistakes but discovering what you're trying to say. Can you think of a time when cutting, rearranging, or substantially changing your writing actually *changed* your thinking—not just clarified pre-existing ideas? What does this suggest about the relationship between writing and thinking?

2. **The cutting room floor**: This course asks you to preserve process documentation (dev logs, abandoned drafts, failed experiments). Why might keeping track of what *didn't* work be as valuable as documenting what did? How does this connect to the course's difficulty-as-diagnostic principle?

3. **Labor and value**: Bernstein emphasizes that the *work* of revision—the labor, the time, the struggle—is where meaning gets made. How does this connect to the course's distinction between writing-as-verb (labor, process) and writing-as-noun (product, capital)? What happens when we only value the final product and ignore the process that generated it?
