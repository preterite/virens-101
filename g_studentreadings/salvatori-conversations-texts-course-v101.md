## Context

You'll read Salvatori's "Conversations with Texts: Reading in the Teaching of Composition" during **Week 2** of Movement 1 (Surfacing), alongside Ong's piece. While Ong explains *why* writing is a technology that restructures thought, Salvatori explains *how* to read actively and productively. This reading establishes a core principle for the entire course: **difficulty in reading (and writing) is informational, not failure**. When you find a text confusing or challenging, that moment of difficulty often points directly to what's most important or complex in the argument.

---

## Description

Salvatori argues that reading should be understood as "hermeneutical conversation with a text"—an active, questioning engagement rather than passive absorption. She introduces the concept of the "difficulty paper," where students describe specific moments when a text posed challenges for them, then analyze *why* those moments were difficult. The insight: what students mark as "difficult" almost always identifies crucial features of the text that deserve critical attention. Instead of seeing difficulty as a problem to solve or a sign of inadequacy, Salvatori treats difficulty as a signal pointing to conceptual complexity worth exploring.

## Guiding Questions

Before you read, consider these questions. Return to them as you engage with Salvatori's argument:

1. **Difficulty as diagnostic**: Think about a recent time you found a text (or writing task) difficult. What *specifically* made it hard? Looking back, what did that difficulty reveal—about the text's complexity, about your assumptions, or about what you needed to understand? How might approaching difficulty as "information" rather than "failure" change your writing process?

2. **Conversations vs. extraction**: Salvatori describes reading as "conversation" rather than "information extraction." What's the difference? In a conversation, you respond, question, and sometimes misunderstand before clarifying. How might treating a difficult reading as a conversation (rather than a puzzle to solve) change how you engage with it?

3. **Marks on the page**: Salvatori discusses how students mark texts (highlighting, underlining, annotations). When you mark a text, what are you marking—things you agree with? Things you don't understand? Important claims? What might your marking patterns reveal about how you're reading, and what assumptions you bring to texts?
