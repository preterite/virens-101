## Design Rationale

### Why This Reading

Ong's [[@ong2012writi]] "Writing Restructures Consciousness" provides the foundational insight that writing is a technology—not a transparent medium but a tool that shapes consciousness itself. This reading is essential for the course's systems-thinking approach because it denaturalizes writing: students can't see writing-as-system if they assume writing is simply the recording of pre-existing thoughts. Ong makes explicit that how we write determines what we can think.

### Why Week 2 Placement

This reading arrives in Week 2 of Movement 1 (Surfacing), very early in the semester, for strategic reasons. Students need this conceptual foundation *before* we introduce systematic process documentation and tool choices. If students understand that writing tools restructure consciousness, then learning about index cards, dev logs, and fragment management isn't arbitrary method—it's conscious tool selection with cognitive consequences. The constraint sequencing principle applies: this conceptual framework must arrive before practical tools, so students understand *why* tool choices matter.

## Theoretical Grounding

### Composition Pedagogy

Ong's work grounds the course's emphasis on **writing-as-technology** and **material hermeneutics**—the idea that the physical and systematic means of writing matter beyond surface-level convenience. His argument that literacy creates "distance" between knower and known provides the epistemological foundation for the course's emphasis on reflection and documentation: making writing processes visible enables analysis and improvement.

This connects to the course's first principle (iteration as normal and productive) because Ong helps students see that recursive, looping processes aren't failures—they're enabled by writing's technological capacity to make thought manipulable. When students understand that writing *creates* the distance needed for revision, they can approach iteration as fundamental rather than remedial.

### Systems/Design Thinking

Ong bridges composition pedagogy and systems thinking by treating writing as a cognitive technology with systemic effects. His insight that technologies restructure consciousness—not just enable new actions but change the nature of thought itself—parallels Norman's [[@norman2013desig]] concept of affordances and Star [[@star1999ethnp]] & Bowker's work on infrastructure: tools don't neutrally transmit meaning but actively shape what can be meant.

This reading prepares students for later systems/design readings (Meadows [[@meadows2008lever]], Norman, Alexander [[@alexander1964notet]]) by establishing that *how* we organize and manipulate information matters as much as *what* information we have. Ong's historical analysis (oral vs. literate cultures) provides concrete evidence that systematic changes in information technology produce systematic changes in consciousness.

## Implementation Approach

### How Students Engage

Students read Ong's excerpt (~10-12 pages) during Week 2, paired with initial exploration of the course's fragment-accumulation approach. The guiding questions ask students to:

1. Connect Ong's abstract claims about "technology" to specific tools they use
2. Identify what becomes possible when writing creates "distance"  
3. Consider implications for how they approach difficulty in writing

These questions operationalize Ong's theoretical insights by asking students to test them against lived experience. Rather than treating Ong as content to master, students use Ong as a lens for examining their own practices—consistent with Salvatori's [[@salvatori1996conve]] "conversations with texts" pedagogy.

### Connection to Course Activities

Week 2 activities include:
- Initial fragment writing and accumulation
- Introduction to index cards as capture tool
- First dev log entry (documenting process)

Ong's reading immediately precedes these activities, so students can consciously examine: "How does writing on index cards (vs. laptop, vs. phone) change what I can think? What does the dev log format make visible that wasn't visible before?" The reading provides vocabulary (technology, distance, analysis) for metacognitive reflection on tool choices.

## Competing Values & Tradeoffs

### What This Reading Offers

- **Denaturalization**: Students often assume writing is transparent; Ong makes writing's constructive role explicit
- **Theoretical grounding**: Provides scholarly foundation for the course's emphasis on tools and systems
- **Historical perspective**: Oral/literate comparison gives students concrete examples of consciousness-restructuring

### Potential Challenges

- **Abstraction**: Ong writes at a high level of generalization; students may struggle to connect to practice
- **Dated examples**: Original context (1980s media ecology) may feel distant from digital writing
- **Length vs. density**: Short excerpt, but conceptually demanding

### How Design Mitigates Challenges

The guiding questions deliberately ground Ong's abstractions in students' immediate experience: "What tool have you used...?" "When you write something down..." This bridges theory and practice. Placement in Week 2 (not Week 1) gives students a few days of actual writing practice *before* reading Ong, so they have concrete experiences to think with.

The course note's framing (technology, distance, naturalness) pre-organizes Ong's key concepts, reducing cognitive load. We don't ask students to write a difficulty paper on Ong (too early, too abstract), but simply to engage the guiding questions—manageable stakes for high-impact insight.

## Evidence & Iteration

### Evidence to Collect

- [ ] Do students reference Ong's concepts (technology, distance, analysis) in dev logs or reflections?
- [ ] When discussing tool choices, do students demonstrate awareness that tools shape thinking?
- [ ] In difficulty reflections, do students distinguish between "hard because I'm not using right tool" vs. "hard because concept is new"?

### Revision Notes

If students struggle with abstraction: consider adding a contemporary example (e.g., voice-to-text vs. typing, Twitter's character limit shaping discourse).

If timing feels too early: could move to Week 3, but risk losing the constraint-sequencing benefit (need theory before tool instruction).
