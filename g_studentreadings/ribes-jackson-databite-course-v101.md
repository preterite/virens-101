## Context

You'll read Ribes and Jackson's [[@ribes2013datb]] "Data Bite Man" during **Week 11** of Movement 3 (Operating at Scale), the final week of the movement. You're completing your BEAM Portfolio and managing a substantial corpus—and experiencing the ongoing labor of maintaining writing systems. This reading examines a long-term ecological study and the invisible maintenance work required to keep data collections usable over decades. The essay helps you recognize that writing corpora, like data archives, don't maintain themselves—they require ongoing care, organization, updating, and attention.

## Description

Ribes and Jackson examine how a long-term ecological study survives across generations of researchers, technologies, and institutional changes. They reveal the "invisible work" of data maintenance: reformatting datasets, documenting collection methods, training new researchers, migrating to new software, and preserving institutional memory. The "data bite man" metaphor captures how accumulated material degrades without care—like the deteriorating equipment storage buildings the authors photographed. Their insight: maintenance work is essential but typically ignored in accounts of research that celebrate discovery and innovation.

## Guiding Questions

Before you read, consider these questions. Return to them as you engage with Ribes and Jackson's analysis:

1. **Maintenance labor**: You've been accumulating fragments for 10 weeks. What maintenance work have you been doing—reorganizing folders, updating file names, cleaning up tags, backing up files, consolidating similar fragments? This work is often invisible (no one sees it, it doesn't produce new writing), but what would happen to your corpus without it? How does recognizing maintenance as essential labor change how you value this work?

2. **Decay and entropy**: Ribes and Jackson show how data collections degrade over time without active care—file formats become obsolete, contexts get forgotten, organizational systems stop making sense. Looking at your early fragments (Week 1-2), can you still understand why you wrote them, what they were for, what context they addressed? What might you do _now_ to preserve that context for your future self assembling the portfolio?

3. **Documentation as care**: The essay emphasizes documentation—not just collecting data, but explaining what it is, why it exists, how to use it. How does your semester of dev logs, spec documents, and process notes function as care work for your corpus? What happens if you skip documentation—is your writing less usable? How might thinking of documentation as "care" (rather than "requirement") shift your relationship to it?
