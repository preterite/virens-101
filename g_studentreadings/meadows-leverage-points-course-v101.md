## Context

You'll read Donella Meadows's "Leverage Points" during **Week 5** of Movement 2 (Naming), when you're actively working to organize and classify your accumulated fragments. Meadows introduces systems thinking—understanding how interconnected parts create behavior over time. This reading provides vocabulary for analyzing your writing process as a *system* with feedback loops, delays, and intervention points. Understanding where to intervene in your own writing system (tools, habits, constraints) is more effective than random changes.

## Description

Meadows argues that systems have specific "leverage points"—places where small interventions can produce large effects. She ranks twelve leverage points from weakest (adjusting numbers, buffers) to strongest (changing system goals, paradigms, or the power to self-organize). The counterintuitive insight: obvious interventions (working harder, adding more time) often have less impact than structural changes (changing when feedback arrives, shifting what you measure as success). Meadows shows that understanding system structure reveals where effort is most effective.

## Guiding Questions

Before you read, consider these questions. Return to them as you engage with Meadows's framework:

1. **Intervention effectiveness**: Think about a time you tried to improve your writing process—maybe by setting a schedule, using a new tool, or changing your environment. Did it work? Looking at Meadows's leverage points hierarchy, what kind of intervention were you attempting? Might a different intervention point (changing goals, feedback timing, or what you measure) have been more effective?

2. **Feedback loops and delays**: Meadows emphasizes that systems include feedback (outputs become inputs) and delays (time between action and effect). In your writing process, where do you receive feedback—from yourself, peers, grades? How much delay exists between writing and feedback? How might changing feedback timing or sources shift your writing behavior?

3. **Goals and paradigms**: Meadows identifies "system goals" and "paradigm changes" as the most powerful leverage points. What are your current goals for writing—grades? Learning? Building a corpus for future use? What paradigm shift might the course be asking you to make—from "writing to complete assignments" to "writing to accumulate reusable material," or from "writing as product" to "writing as system"? How might this paradigm shift change your behavior?
