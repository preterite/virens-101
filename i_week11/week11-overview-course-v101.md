## This Week's Place in the Course

Week 11 closes Movement 3 and prepares for the synthesis work of Movement 4. Students complete their BEAM Portfolios—the culmination of source-gathering and analysis work across M3—while Ribes and Jackson's "Data Bite Man" provides vocabulary for understanding the maintenance labor that has made this accumulation possible. The week foregrounds **distill**, the fifth of our six moves, as students extract essential insights from their source analyses.

The reading pairs explicitly with last week's Star [[@star1999ethnp]]: where Star showed infrastructure becoming visible at moments of breakdown, Ribes and Jackson show what infrastructure looks like *while you're building and maintaining it*. This pairing completes the M3 arc—students have built systems, operated them at scale, and can now name the labor that sustains them.

**Key transition**: BEAM Portfolio completion marks the end of M3 accumulation; Documented Inquiry planning begins M4 synthesis.

## Synthesis

Last week we examined infrastructure—the invisible systems that enable work without calling attention to themselves. Susan Leigh Star showed us that infrastructure becomes visible at moments of breakdown, when what usually works suddenly doesn't. This week, David Ribes and Steven J. Jackson turn that insight inside out: they show us what infrastructure looks like *while you're building and maintaining it*. The view is less elegant than Star's finished picture. It's full of tedious rituals, careful transfers, anxious checking, and the constant threat of loss.

Ribes and Jackson's core claim is stark: "Data are ephemeral creatures that threaten to become corrupted, lost, or meaningless if not properly cared for." Note the grammar—*data are*, not *data is*. Data is plural; each datum is a single creature, and your corpus contains many of them. The metaphor matters. Creatures require feeding, attention, maintenance. Leave them alone too long and they wither. Treat them carelessly and they die. The BEAM Portfolio you're completing this week is a collection of such creatures—source analyses, pattern observations, synthesis notes—all of which threaten to become meaningless if you stop caring for them.

The article tracks stream chemistry data in the Baltimore region over decades, watching how scientists and technicians transform "flowing streams" into "ordered rows of well-described digital data, readily available for use in science." This transformation is not automatic. It requires human labor at every step: labeling bottles, checking instruments, transcribing readings, verifying entries, maintaining databases, documenting changes. Ribes and Jackson's cases "demonstrate the staggering amount of work that goes into the production of information."

That phrase—*staggering amount of work*—should resonate. You've now accumulated thirty to forty-two fragments. You've built BEAM entries analyzing how sources function as Background, Exhibit, Argument, or Method. You've maintained dev logs, updated folders, revised earlier work based on feedback. The BEAM Portfolio you submit this week represents weeks of labor, most of which disappears in the final product. Readers see polished entries; they don't see the failed drafts, the reorganized folders, the sources that didn't work out, the classification decisions you reconsidered. Your infrastructure has become invisible—which means it's working.

This week foregrounds the fifth move in our six-move vocabulary: **distill**. To distill is to extract the essential insight from raw material—to boil away what's extraneous and concentrate what matters. The BEAM Portfolio is distillation work. You've read sources, highlighted passages, taken notes. Now you extract what's essential: What does this source contribute to understanding your topic? How does it function in scholarly conversation? What patterns emerge when you examine sources together? Distillation doesn't just summarize; it transforms. The scattered notes become analyzed entries. The isolated sources become a mapped conversation.

Distillation requires care. Ribes and Jackson describe the rituals that sustain data over time: the labeling, the checking, the documentation. These rituals seem tedious—and they are—but they're also constitutive. The data doesn't exist independently of the care that maintains it. Your BEAM entries don't exist independently of the reading, analyzing, and revising you've done to create them. The product is inseparable from the process.

This reframes what "maintenance" means. It's not just preserving something that already exists; it's the ongoing labor that makes existence possible. Ribes and Jackson conclude with an image worth dwelling on: "What we have offered here is another narrative, one of temperamental and delicate creatures, whose existence and fraternity with one another depend on a complex assemblage of people, instruments, and practices dedicated to their production, management, and care." Notice "fraternity with one another"—the creatures need connection to survive. An isolated source entry, disconnected from your other work, loses meaning. A fragment that never links to anything else becomes orphaned. The care includes not just maintaining individual pieces but maintaining their relationships.

The corpse-to-garden transformation depends on this care. Early fragments were corpses—dead material awaiting transformation. Your BEAM Portfolio represents compost taking shape, sources digested and analyzed and connected. But compost requires tending—and turning. Gardeners physically turn compost to aerate it, to mix materials, to accelerate decomposition. Writing requires similar turning: revisiting old fragments with new questions, reorienting sources toward different arguments, mixing material that didn't seem related until you turned it over. The portfolio isn't finished when you submit it; it becomes material for what comes next.

Which brings us to the transition beginning this week. As BEAM Portfolio work concludes, Documented Inquiry planning begins. The Documented Inquiry will draw on your portfolio—the sources you've gathered, the patterns you've identified, the analyses you've developed. It asks you to enter scholarly conversation as a participant, not just an observer. Your distilled source analyses become raw material for a new kind of writing: sustained inquiry that traces how your thinking evolved through engagement with sources.

This is Movement 3 ending and Movement 4 beginning. You've been operating at scale—managing a growing corpus, maintaining systems, navigating complexity. Now you shift to synthesis—selecting from what you've built, shaping it for audiences, making your process visible and your arguments clear. The maintenance labor doesn't stop; it changes form. Instead of building infrastructure, you'll be using it. Instead of accumulating material, you'll be selecting from it. The creatures you've cared for all semester become the resources for final work.

But only if you've cared for them. Only if the fragments are findable, the sources are documented, the connections are traceable. The staggering work you've done becomes visible in what it enables—or exposes its gaps in what it can't support. This week, as you complete the BEAM Portfolio and begin planning what comes next, take stock of your infrastructure. What's working? What's fragile? What would you do differently? The Process Archaeology assignment in Movement 4 will ask exactly these questions. Start noticing now.

## Reading

### Primary Text

**David Ribes and Steven J. Jackson, "Data Bite Man: The Work of Sustaining a Long-Term Study"** (~15-20 pages)

From the collection *Raw Data Is an Oxymoron* (ed. Lisa Gitelman), this chapter follows long-term ecological research in the Baltimore region, tracking how stream chemistry data is produced, preserved, and maintained over decades. The central argument: data are not stable objects but "ephemeral creatures" requiring constant care—labeling, checking, documenting, connecting. The article reveals the invisible labor that makes scientific data usable over time.

**Reading focus**: Pay attention to the rituals of care Ribes and Jackson describe—the bottle labeling, the database checks, the documentation practices. These may seem far from writing, but consider: What are the equivalent rituals in your own work? What would happen to your corpus if you stopped maintaining it?

### Connecting to Course Concepts

Ribes and Jackson completes the infrastructure arc begun with Star:

| Star (Week 10) | Ribes & Jackson (Week 11) |
|----------------|---------------------------|
| Infrastructure visible at breakdown | Infrastructure visible during construction |
| Finished systems seem natural | Building systems requires constant labor |
| "When" of visibility | "How" of maintenance |
| Theoretical framework | Ethnographic case study |

Together, they provide vocabulary for Process Archaeology: Star names what to look for (infrastructure, breakdown, visibility); Ribes and Jackson names what you've been doing (production, management, care).

## ONESIES: New Concept Introduction

### Maintenance Labor

**Definition**: The ongoing work required to keep systems, data, and artifacts usable over time. Maintenance labor includes checking, updating, documenting, repairing, and connecting—tasks that often disappear from view precisely when they're working well. Ribes and Jackson show that this labor is not secondary to "real" work but constitutive of it: without maintenance, data becomes meaningless.

**Application to writing**: Your corpus requires maintenance labor—updating dev logs, reorganizing folders, revisiting old fragments, maintaining citation accuracy. This labor often feels tedious compared to "real" writing, but it's what makes real writing possible. The BEAM Portfolio represents accumulated maintenance: sources tracked, analyses developed, connections documented.

**Key insight**: Maintenance labor is skilled work, not clerical drudgery. Knowing what to check, when to update, how to document—these require judgment developed through practice. The rituals you've developed over eleven weeks are expertise, even if they don't feel like it.

**Key quotation**: "Data are ephemeral creatures that threaten to become corrupted, lost, or meaningless if not properly cared for" (Ribes & Jackson 147).

### Distill (Six-Move Vocabulary)

**Definition**: To extract the essential insight from raw material—to boil away what's extraneous and concentrate what matters. Distillation transforms; the output is not a smaller version of the input but something qualitatively different.

**Application**: The BEAM Portfolio is distillation work. You've read entire articles; your entries capture essential contributions. You've gathered many sources; your synthesis identifies patterns across them. Distillation asks: What does this *really* contribute? What's the concentrated insight?

**Distinction from summarizing**: Summary preserves structure and reduces length. Distillation extracts essence and changes form. A summary of an article follows the article's organization; a distilled insight might be a single sentence that captures what matters for *your* purposes.

**Position in six-move sequence**: Distill follows capture, classify, route, and connect. You can only distill material you've already gathered and organized. Distillation prepares material for the final move: publish.

## Block-by-Block Plan

### Block 1 (W): BEAM Portfolio Completion

**Opening** (3 min): Orient to Week 11's dual purpose: completing BEAM Portfolio (M3 capstone) and transitioning toward Documented Inquiry (M4 beginning). Today focuses on portfolio completion—ensuring all required entries are drafted and synthesis observations are articulated.

**Main** (20 min): BEAM Portfolio drafting. Students work on:
- Completing any remaining source entries
- Developing synthesis observations (patterns, gaps, conflicts across sources)
- Ensuring BEAM classifications are explicit and justified

**Closing** (2 min): Checkpoint: Do you have all required entries? Are your synthesis observations connecting sources rather than just listing them? Portfolio revision continues Block 3.

---

### Block 2 (R-touch): Revision + Process Documentation Review

**Opening** (2 min): Transition to revision work with embedded process documentation check. The 10-minute review mid-block asks you to examine the infrastructure you've built.

**Main Part 1** (10 min): BEAM Portfolio revision. Focus on strengthening individual entries based on prior feedback.

**Process Documentation Review** (10 min):

> [!note] Process Documentation Review Protocol
> 
> **Purpose**: Assess the health of your documentation infrastructure before M4 synthesis work.
> 
> **Quick Inventory** (3 min):
> - Open your dev log. When was the last entry? Are there gaps?
> - Check your folder structure. Can you find things? Are there orphaned files?
> - Look at your fragment index (if maintained). Is it current?
> 
> **Diagnostic Questions** (4 min): Answer briefly in your dev log:
> - What's working in your current system?
> - What's fragile—what would break if you stopped maintaining it?
> - What would you do differently if starting over?
> 
> **One Maintenance Action** (3 min):
> - Identify one thing that needs care right now (update an entry, move a file, add a dev log note)
> - Do it.
> 
> **Rationale**: Ribes and Jackson show that maintenance is ongoing. This review surfaces your infrastructure's current state before M4 demands you use it intensively.

**Main Part 2** (3 min): Return briefly to BEAM revision or continue documentation work.

**Closing** (2 min): Note any major infrastructure concerns for conference discussion or independent follow-up.

---

### Block 3 (R): Final BEAM Portfolio Revision

**Opening** (2 min): Final revision push before instructor feedback. Focus on synthesis quality—are your observations connecting sources meaningfully?

**Main** (21 min): Deep revision work. Priorities:
1. **Synthesis observations**: Do they identify genuine patterns, not just topics?
2. **BEAM justifications**: Is it clear *why* each source functions as B, E, A, or M?
3. **Source coverage**: Do entries demonstrate engagement, not just summary?

**Closing** (2 min): Prepare questions for instructor feedback session. What are you uncertain about? Where do you want guidance?

---

### Block 4 (I): Instructor Feedback on BEAM Portfolios

**Opening** (3 min): Overview of feedback session format. Instructor will circulate for brief individual consultations while students continue independent work.

**Main** (20 min): Instructor feedback rotation. While waiting:
- Continue BEAM revision
- Begin thinking about Documented Inquiry topic (what question emerges from your sources?)
- Review dev log for Process Archaeology material

**Closing** (2 min): Identify one priority revision based on feedback received. BEAM Portfolio due end of week.

---

### Block 5 (W): Begin Documented Inquiry Planning

**Opening** (5 min): Introduce Documented Inquiry assignment. This is M4's major writing project: sustained inquiry (1800-2500 words) drawing on BEAM Portfolio sources. Key features:
- Inquiry-driven, not thesis-driven (start with questions, trace thinking)
- Dialogic source engagement (sources as conversation partners)
- Process visible (show how understanding evolved)

**Main** (18 min): Documented Inquiry planning work:
- Review BEAM Portfolio synthesis observations: What questions emerge?
- Identify 6-10 sources likely to anchor inquiry
- Draft 2-3 genuine questions (not rhetorical, not already answered)
- Begin mapping how sources might speak to questions

**Closing** (2 min): Share one emerging question with a neighbor. Does it feel genuinely open, or do you already know what you think?

---

### Block 6 (R): Dev Log Update + System Map Draft

**Opening** (3 min): Final M3 documentation work. Two tasks: updating dev log with Week 11 observations and beginning system map draft.

**Main Part 1: Dev Log Update** (10 min): Add substantive entry covering:
- BEAM Portfolio completion: What did you learn about your sources? About your process?
- Infrastructure assessment: What's working? What needs attention?
- M3→M4 transition: What are you carrying forward? What are you leaving behind?

**Main Part 2: System Map Draft** (10 min): Begin sketching your workflow visually:
- What are the main components (folders, tools, routines)?
- How do materials flow between them?
- Where are the decision points?

This doesn't need to be polished—it's exploratory. The goal is making your infrastructure visible to yourself.

**Closing** (2 min): System map work continues independently. This becomes material for Process Archaeology in M4.

## Assignments

### BEAM Portfolio (M3 Capstone)

**Due**: End of Week 11

**Description**: Complete portfolio of source analyses using BEAM framework, including:
- Individual source entries (B, E, A, or M classification with justification)
- Synthesis observations (patterns, gaps, conflicts across sources)
- Source genealogy (how sources connect and cite each other)

**Connection to Week 11**: Ribes and Jackson's "maintenance labor" names what you've been doing. The portfolio represents care work—sources tracked, analyzed, connected, documented. Submitting it makes your infrastructure visible.

See: [[beam-portfolio-assignment-course-v101]]

---

### Documented Inquiry (Begins)

**Due**: Week 12 (draft for peer review)

**This week**: Planning begins. Identify questions emerging from BEAM Portfolio, select sources for inquiry focus, draft preliminary questions.

**Connection to synthesis**: The Documented Inquiry draws on your portfolio—the "staggering amount of work" you've done becomes raw material for sustained argument. Distillation continues: you'll select from accumulated sources, extract what matters for your inquiry.

See: [[documented-inquiry-assignment-course-v101]]

---

### Process Documentation

**Ongoing**: Dev log update (Block 6), System map draft begun

**Connection to Week 11**: The process documentation review (Block 2) surfaces infrastructure health. Dev log and system map work prepares material for Process Archaeology—you're documenting while the process is fresh.

---

## Concept Connections

### Star ↔ Ribes & Jackson (Infrastructure Pair)

These readings form an explicit pair across Weeks 10-11:

| Dimension | Star | Ribes & Jackson |
|-----------|------|-----------------|
| **Focus** | Infrastructure as phenomenon | Maintenance as practice |
| **Visibility** | At breakdown | During construction |
| **Metaphor** | Substrate, "sunk into" | "Ephemeral creatures" |
| **Labor** | Named but not detailed | Described ethnographically |
| **Stance** | Analytical | Ethnographic |

Together: Star provides conceptual framework; Ribes & Jackson shows what the framework looks like in practice. Both inform Process Archaeology—you'll analyze your own infrastructure and the labor that sustains it.

### Distill in the Six-Move Sequence

| Move | Definition | When Emphasized | Week 11 Status |
|------|------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Capture | Get the idea out immediately | M1 | Operational |
| Classify | Identify what type of material | M2 | Operational |
| Route | Send to appropriate location | M2 | Operational |
| Distill | Extract essential insight | **M3 (this week)** | **Foregrounded** |
| Connect | Link to related items | M3 | Operational |
| Publish | Generate outputs | M4 | Upcoming |

Distill is the M3 culmination move—you've accumulated material, now you extract what matters. The BEAM Portfolio is distillation made visible.

### Corpse→Compost→Garden Arc

| Stage | M1-M2 | M3 | M4 |
|-------|-------|-----|-----|
| **Corpse** | Raw fragments, initial captures | — | — |
| **Compost** | — | BEAM Portfolio (sources digested, connected) | — |
| **Garden** | — | — | Final portfolio (cultivated, selected) |

Week 11 is deep in compost territory. The material is transforming but requires tending and turning—conceptual reorientation that accelerates decomposition into usable soil.

---

## Looking Ahead

**Week 12**: Movement 4 begins. Norman's [[@norman2013desig]] *Design of Everyday Things* introduces affordances vocabulary for examining designed objects—including portfolios. Documented Inquiry drafting intensifies; portfolio selection begins. The maintenance labor you've done becomes infrastructure you use.

**Week 13**: Process Archaeology reaches completion, using Ribes & Jackson's vocabulary to analyze your own workflow. Bernstein on revision as meaning-making. Permission flags receive full treatment.

**Week 14**: Presentations. Students share portfolio work and Process Archaeology insights.

**Week 15**: Final portfolio submission. The creatures you've cared for all semester take final form.
