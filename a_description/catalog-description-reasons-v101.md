## Design Rationale

The catalog description maintains recognizability as first-year composition while introducing subtle but significant shifts in emphasis that signal the course's innovative approach. The one-sentence format follows WSU catalog conventions; the language choices strategically signal pedagogical commitments without requiring extensive explanation.

This description must satisfy multiple stakeholders:
- **Registrar's office**: Recognizable as first-year writing, aligned with transfer equivalencies
- **Students**: Clear about what the course teaches
- **Faculty colleagues**: Signals contemporary composition pedagogy
- **Administrators**: Demonstrates alignment with institutional learning outcomes

The design balances institutional legibility with pedagogical innovation—keeping the course recognizable while introducing language that supports new approaches.

## Theoretical Grounding

### Shifts in Emphasis: From Original to VIRENS

The original WSU catalog description reads:
> "Designed to further develop students' academic writing, critical thinking, rhetorical strategies, reading and library skills."

The VIRENS version reads:
> "Designed to develop students' academic writing **processes**, critical thinking, rhetorical **awareness**, and research practices through sustained textual accumulation and constraint-based writing."

Each change is intentional:

**1. "academic writing" → "academic writing processes"**

Adding "processes" signals that the course teaches *how* writing happens, not just what writing looks like. This aligns with Nancy Sommers' research showing that expert writers think about writing as recursive process rather than linear procedure. The shift reflects composition pedagogy's movement from product to process orientation, while the single-word addition keeps the description catalog-appropriate.

**2. "rhetorical strategies" → "rhetorical awareness"**

"Strategies" suggests a toolkit of techniques; "awareness" emphasizes metacognitive understanding. This shift reflects research on transfer: students need rhetorical awareness—understanding of *when* and *why* to deploy strategies—not just strategy knowledge. The change foregrounds the threshold concept that rhetoric isn't just persuasive techniques but a way of analyzing how meaning-making works in contexts.

**3. "reading and library skills" → "research practices"**

"Library skills" dates the description to pre-digital scholarship; "research practices" encompasses both print and digital information literacy while emphasizing practice over skills. "Practices" signals habits and workflows rather than discrete competencies, aligning with the course's emphasis on sustainable research processes. This language also better reflects the integrated nature of research in the course—not separate "library days" but research woven throughout textual production.

**4. Adding "through sustained textual accumulation and constraint-based writing"**

This addition introduces the course's two core innovations while remaining intelligible to readers unfamiliar with the specific pedagogical framework:

- **"Sustained textual accumulation"** signals that students build a corpus over time rather than completing discrete assignments. "Sustained" emphasizes the semester-long timeline; "textual accumulation" names the economic model (writing as capital that accrues value) without requiring readers to understand the full theoretical framework. The language is descriptive enough to be clear but distinctive enough to signal innovation.

- **"Constraint-based writing"** introduces the concept of constraints as productive rather than merely limiting. This language draws from creative writing traditions (Oulipo, constrained writing exercises) while signaling the course's systematic approach to constraint sequencing. It's accessible language—students understand "constraint"—while pointing toward sophisticated pedagogical principles.

### Composition Pedagogy: Process and Recursion

The emphasis on "processes" rather than just "writing" reflects decades of composition research. Peter Elbow's work on freewriting and low-stakes writing, Linda Flower and John Hayes' cognitive process models, Sondra Perl's research on felt sense, and Nancy Sommers' studies of revision all converge on the finding that writing is not transcription of pre-formed thought but a method of thinking itself.

The course description signals this commitment without requiring catalog readers to understand specific research findings. "Writing processes" is legible to general audiences while signaling to composition specialists that the course embraces post-process understanding of writing as complex, situated, and recursive.

### Systems Thinking: Accumulation and Flow

The "sustained textual accumulation" language introduces systems thinking concepts—particularly Donella Meadows' distinction between stocks and flows—into a catalog description. Writing-as-noun is a stock (accumulated capital); writing-as-verb is flow (ongoing production). Students accumulate textual assets throughout the semester; those assets gain value through connection and revision.

This economic model challenges the traditional assignment-episode structure where each essay is discrete and disconnected. Instead, students build inventory that appreciates. The catalog language doesn't explain this fully but introduces the vocabulary that the syllabus will develop.

## Implementation Approach

### Maintaining Institutional Legibility

Despite innovations, the description remains recognizable as first-year composition:
- Opens with "Designed to develop students' academic writing"—conventional framing
- Includes "critical thinking"—required for WSU UCORE
- Mentions "rhetorical awareness"—signals alignment with WPA Outcomes
- References "research practices"—indicates information literacy component

Administrators, registrars, and transfer evaluators can map this onto standard composition course descriptions without difficulty. The innovations are additions and refinements, not replacements of core expectations.

### Signaling to Different Audiences

The description works at multiple levels:

**For students**: "Academic writing processes" clarifies they'll learn *how* to write; "research practices" signals real-world applicability; "constraint-based writing" sounds structured and manageable.

**For faculty**: "Rhetorical awareness" signals contemporary theory; "textual accumulation" hints at alternative assessment; "constraint-based" suggests systematic pedagogy.

**For administrators**: All traditional composition components present; innovation is enhancement, not replacement.

### Preparing for Syllabus Expansion

The catalog description introduces concepts the [[course-overview-course-v101|course overview]] will elaborate:
- What does "sustained textual accumulation" mean in practice?
- How do constraints function as productive rather than limiting?
- What distinguishes "rhetorical awareness" from "rhetorical strategies"?

The catalog plants seeds the syllabus will cultivate.

## Competing Values & Tradeoffs

### Innovation vs. Recognition

**Tension**: Too innovative risks confusion; too conventional misrepresents the course.

**Resolution**: Keep structure conventional ("Designed to develop...") while introducing new concepts ("textual accumulation," "constraint-based") that are understandable even without full theoretical background.

**Tradeoff accepted**: Some readers may not recognize how significantly the course differs from traditional English 101. However, catalog descriptions necessarily simplify; the syllabus provides fuller context.

### Brevity vs. Precision

**Tension**: One sentence cannot fully describe a 15-week course with seven learning outcomes and four movements.

**Resolution**: Prioritize the two most distinctive features (accumulation, constraints) while ensuring traditional components (critical thinking, rhetorical awareness, research) remain visible.

**Tradeoff accepted**: Many important elements (peer review, reflection, workflow technologies) go unmentioned. The catalog description is an entry point, not complete documentation.

### Theory vs. Accessibility

**Tension**: "Textual accumulation" and "constraint-based writing" draw from systems thinking and design theory that catalog readers may not know.

**Resolution**: Use language that's intelligible without specialized knowledge while pointing toward theoretical sophistication. "Accumulation" and "constraint" are everyday words; their technical meanings emerge through practice.

**Tradeoff accepted**: Theorists might want more explicit citations; students might want simpler language. The catalog description splits the difference.

## Evidence & Iteration

### Evidence to Collect

- [ ] **Student comprehension**: Do students entering the course understand what "textual accumulation" means? Survey first-day students.
- [ ] **Transfer evaluation**: Do other institutions accept this course as first-year composition equivalent? Track transfer decisions.
- [ ] **Colleague interpretation**: How do other writing instructors read this description? What do they think the course entails?
- [ ] **Administrative acceptance**: Does the description satisfy WSU catalog standards and UCORE alignment requirements?

### Revision Notes

*To be completed after first semester implementation and stakeholder feedback.*

Post-pilot considerations:
1. Does "textual accumulation" require explanation, or does practice clarify it?
2. Is "constraint-based writing" too specialized, or does it successfully distinguish the course?
3. Should "rhetorical awareness" remain, or does it insufficiently differentiate from "rhetorical knowledge"?
4. Do transfer institutions flag any language as non-standard for first-year composition?
