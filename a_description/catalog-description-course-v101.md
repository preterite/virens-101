## Official Catalog Description

Designed to develop students' academic writing processes, critical thinking, rhetorical awareness, and research practices through sustained textual accumulation and constraint-based writing.

---

## Context

This one-sentence description appears in:
- WSU Course Catalog
- Student registration system
- Course search interfaces
- Transfer equivalency documentation

It serves as the official institutional description of English 101 and must remain recognizable as a first-year composition course while signaling key pedagogical emphases.
