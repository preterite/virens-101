## What Is a Dev Log?

A **development log** (dev log) is a running record of your writing work. It's borrowed from software development, where programmers keep logs of what they built, what broke, and what they learned.

Your dev log answers three questions:
1. **What did I do?** (the work)
2. **What happened?** (the results—expected and unexpected)
3. **What did I learn?** (the insight)

That's it. Three parts, roughly 150-250 words total per entry.

## Why Keep a Dev Log?

**For you:**
- Makes your process visible so you can see patterns
- Creates evidence for portfolio reflections (you won't remember Week 3 by Week 14)
- Helps you diagnose when you're stuck ("I keep struggling at the same point...")
- Builds the habit of noticing what you're doing while you do it

**For the course:**
- Shows your intellectual labor, not just your finished products
- Gives me a window into your process so I can help more effectively
- Demonstrates learning from difficulty, not just success

**For your future:**
- The habit of documenting process transfers to any complex work
- Future-you will thank present-you for writing down how things went

---

## The Three-Part Structure

Each entry has three sections. Here's what goes in each:

### Part 1: What I Did

Describe the actual work you performed. Be specific.

**Good specificity:**
- "Spent 40 minutes drafting a fragment about Ong's claim that writing is a technology"
- "Reviewed three peer fragments and wrote feedback using describe-evaluate-suggest"
- "Reorganized my fragments folder and added status tags to 12 files"

**Too vague:**
- "Worked on my essay"
- "Did some writing"
- "Read stuff"

**Useful details to include:**
- How long did you work?
- What tools did you use?
- What stage of process were you in? (generating, drafting, revising, etc.)
- What move was your material going through? (capture, classify, route, connect, distill)

### Part 2: What Happened

Describe the results—both what you expected and what surprised you.

**Things to notice:**
- Did you accomplish what you intended?
- What went smoothly? What was difficult?
- Did anything unexpected happen?
- Did your thinking change as you worked?

**Good observations:**
- "I expected to finish the fragment but got stuck on how to connect Ong to my own experience. Ended up with two half-fragments instead of one complete one."
- "The peer feedback was more helpful than I expected—Jamie's comment about my unclear claim made me realize I didn't actually know what I was arguing."
- "Routing the fragments into folders took longer than expected because I kept changing my mind about categories."

**Too minimal:**
- "It went fine"
- "I finished"
- "Nothing special"

### Part 3: What I Learned

Identify one insight—about writing, about your process, about the material, about yourself as a writer.

**The insight can be:**
- Something about writing in general ("Revision really does mean re-seeing, not just fixing errors")
- Something about your own process ("I write better in the morning before I check my phone")
- Something about the course material ("Salvatori's 'difficulty' idea applies to my own reading struggles")
- Something about tools or workflow ("Tagging fragments by status helps me see what needs work")

**Good insights:**
- "I learned that I resist connecting fragments because I'm afraid of committing to an argument. The connection feels permanent even though it isn't."
- "Distilling is harder than capturing. I can write a lot, but extracting the core claim takes real thinking."
- "I learned that 'what happened' and 'what I expected' are often different, and that gap is where the learning lives."

**Too generic:**
- "I learned that writing is hard"
- "Practice makes perfect"
- "I need to manage my time better"

---

## How Often? How Many?

**Frequency:** Aim for roughly twice per week, or after any significant writing session.

**Total:** 12-15 entries across the semester.

**Timing suggestions:**
- After each in-class writing session
- After completing a fragment
- After a peer review session
- After receiving feedback and deciding what to do with it
- When you're stuck and trying to figure out why

You don't need to log every single time you write. But you should log often enough that you can look back and see your process over time.

## Examples

### Example 1: After a Drafting Session

> **What I Did:** Worked for 50 minutes on a fragment connecting Bartholomae's "Inventing the University" to my experience in a biology lab report. Used the index card I captured last week about feeling like I was faking expertise.
>
> **What Happened:** The fragment went in a different direction than I planned. I started writing about the lab report but ended up writing about imposter syndrome more broadly. I have 280 words but I'm not sure it's one fragment or two. The connection to Bartholomae feels forced.
>
> **What I Learned:** When the connection to a source feels forced, it might mean I haven't actually understood the source yet, or it might mean I'm connecting to the wrong part of it. I need to go back to Bartholomae and find the specific passage about "inventing" credibility rather than just the general idea.

### Example 2: After Peer Review

> **What I Did:** Gave feedback on Alex's and Taylor's fragments using the describe-evaluate-suggest format. Spent about 20 minutes on each. Also read feedback I received from Morgan.
>
> **What Happened:** Easier to give feedback than I expected—the DES structure helped me say something useful instead of just "good job." Morgan's feedback was harder to process. They said my claim was unclear, but I thought it was clear. Had to sit with that discomfort.
>
> **What I Learned:** "Unclear" in feedback doesn't mean I'm a bad writer—it means the reader couldn't follow. That's information about the text, not about me. I can revise for clarity without feeling attacked. This connects to the "failure-as-diagnostic" idea from class.

### Example 3: After Getting Stuck

> **What I Did:** Tried to work on my fragments for 30 minutes but couldn't focus. Kept opening other tabs. Eventually gave up and just organized my OneDrive folder instead.
>
> **What Happened:** The organizing actually helped. I found three fragments I'd forgotten about, and one of them connects to what I was trying to write. But I didn't get any new words down.
>
> **What I Learned:** Sometimes "not writing" is still part of the process. Organizing is routing—it's a real move, not procrastination. But I also notice I reach for organizing when the writing feels hard. I should watch whether that's productive avoidance or just avoidance.

### Example 4: Short Entry (Minimum Viable)

> **What I Did:** Quick capture session—wrote 3 index cards during the reading for Wednesday.
>
> **What Happened:** The cards are messy but they exist. Didn't classify them yet.
>
> **What I Learned:** Capture first, classify later. Getting ideas down matters more than getting them organized.

## Common Questions

### "What if nothing happened?"

Something always happened. Even if you planned to write and didn't, that's data. Even if you wrote and hated it, that's data. The dev log isn't about reporting success—it's about noticing process.

If you genuinely sat down to work and nothing happened, write about that:
- What did you intend to do?
- What got in the way?
- What might you try differently?

### "Is this just busywork?"

No, but I understand why it might feel that way at first. The dev log serves you more than it serves me. By Week 10, when you're writing your portfolio reflection, you'll have 15+ entries documenting exactly how your process developed. Without the log, you'd be guessing.

Also: the habit of documenting process is genuinely useful beyond this course. Programmers, project managers, researchers, and designers all keep some form of work log. You're practicing a transferable skill.

### "How is this graded?"

**Completion, not quality.** If you write the entry with the three parts and genuine engagement, you get full credit. I'm not grading your insights for brilliance—I'm checking that you're doing the reflective work.

That said, "genuine engagement" means actually trying. A dev log that says "I did stuff, it happened, I learned things" for every entry isn't genuine engagement.

### "Where do I keep it?"

One document in your OneDrive folder, with dated entries. Add new entries at the top (reverse chronological order) so recent work is easy to find.

**Filename:** `dev-log-[YourLastName].docx`

**Format:**
```
## [Date]

**What I Did:**
[Your entry]

**What Happened:**
[Your entry]

**What I Learned:**
[Your entry]

---

## [Earlier Date]

...
```

### "Can I write more than 250 words?"

Yes, if you have more to say. The 150-250 range is a guideline, not a limit. But more words isn't automatically better—a focused 150-word entry often beats a rambling 400-word one.

### "Do I have to use the process/six moves vocabulary?"

You don't have to, but it helps. Naming what stage you're in (generating, revising, editing) or what move your material is going through (capture, route, connect) makes your observations more precise. Over time, the vocabulary becomes natural.

## Using Your Dev Log

The log isn't just for me to read—it's a tool for you. Here's how to use it:

**Weekly:** Skim recent entries before each writing session. What patterns do you notice?

**Before portfolio work:** Read through all entries to find themes, growth, and evidence for your reflection.

**When stuck:** Look for past entries where you got unstuck. What worked?

**In conferences:** Bring your dev log. It helps us talk concretely about your process instead of speaking in generalities.
