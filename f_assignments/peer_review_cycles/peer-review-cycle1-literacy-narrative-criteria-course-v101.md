## Review Protocol: Generous (SPQ)

This cycle uses the **generous protocol** (Sayback-Pointing-Questioning), which prioritizes reader response over evaluative judgment. Your feedback should help the writer understand how you experienced their narrative rather than assessing whether it's "good" or "correct."

**Sayback**: Summarize what you understand the writer to be saying or doing  
**Pointing**: Identify specific passages that work well or that you noticed  
**Questioning**: Ask genuine questions about meaning, purpose, or development

Your written responses should be generous, exploratory, and focused on understanding the writer's work.

## Review Criteria

For each criterion below, check the box if you observe this element in the draft, then write 2-4 sentences explaining what you noticed. Your explanation is more important than the check-box—it helps the writer see their work through your eyes as a reader.

### 1. Narrative Focus & Learning Process

**Check if present**: ☐ The narrative focuses on learning a specific skill or practice and traces the learning process over time

**What to notice**: Can you identify what skill the writer learned? Does the narrative show progression—early attempts, obstacles, developing competence? Or does it feel more like a snapshot than a learning journey?

**Generous response approach**: 
- **Sayback**: "I understand you're narrating learning to [specific skill], starting from [initial state] and developing toward [competence level]"
- **Pointing**: Point to specific moments where you see learning happening or changing
- **Questioning**: "I'm curious about the moment when X happened—can you say more about what changed for you then?"

### 2. Concrete Sensory Detail

**Check if present**: ☐ The narrative uses concrete, sensory language that helps readers experience what the writer experienced

**What to notice**: Does the narrative show rather than tell? Are there specific sensory details (visual, auditory, tactile, spatial) that make the experience vivid? Or does it remain abstract ("I struggled," "it was hard")?

**Generous response approach**:
- **Sayback**: "The sensory details that stood out to me were [specific examples]—these helped me visualize/feel/hear what you experienced"
- **Pointing**: Point to passages where concrete detail works especially well
- **Questioning**: "When you mention [abstract statement], what did that look/sound/feel like in the moment?"

### 3. Analysis of Learning Process

**Check if present**: ☐ The narrative reflects on how learning happened, not just what was learned

**What to notice**: Does the writer analyze their learning process—strategies that worked, obstacles that surprised them, moments of realization? Or does the narrative just report events chronologically without reflection?

**Generous response approach**:
- **Sayback**: "Your analysis of how you learned seems to focus on [strategies/obstacles/breakthroughs]"
- **Pointing**: Point to passages where analytical thinking is strongest
- **Questioning**: "You mention [event or challenge]—what did that teach you about how you learn?"

### 4. Significance Beyond the Skill

**Check if present**: ☐ The narrative explains why this learning matters beyond just acquiring the skill

**What to notice**: Does the writer articulate significance—why this learning experience matters for who they are, how they understand learning, what they value? Or does it end with "and then I could do X"?

**Generous response approach**:
- **Sayback**: "The significance I'm hearing is that this learning experience [meaning you understood]"
- **Pointing**: Point to moments where significance emerges or where you want to hear more
- **Questioning**: "Why do you think this particular learning experience stuck with you rather than others?"

### 5. Narrative Coherence & Organization

**Check if present**: ☐ The narrative has clear organization—readers can follow the chronology and progression of learning

**What to notice**: Can you follow the narrative's timeline? Are there clear transitions between moments or phases of learning? Or do you get confused about when things happened or how they connect?

**Generous response approach**:
- **Sayback**: "The narrative seems to move from [early phase] through [middle challenges] to [later competence], organized around [organizing principle you noticed]"
- **Pointing**: Point to transitions or organizational moves that help you follow the story
- **Questioning**: "I wasn't sure how [event A] connects to [event B]—what's the relationship there?"

### 6. Constraint Experiment Presence

**Check if present**: ☐ The draft includes or references the constraint experiment (three compressed versions at 300, 200, 100 words)

**What to notice**: Has the writer included the three compressed versions? If so, do the compressions show strategic decision-making about what to preserve/eliminate? If not yet included, is there evidence the writer is thinking about compression?

**Generous response approach**:
- **Sayback**: "In your compressed versions, I notice you preserved [elements] while eliminating [elements]"
- **Pointing**: Point to interesting choices in compression—what stayed, what went, what that reveals
- **Questioning**: "What was hardest to eliminate when compressing to 100 words? What surprised you about what you could keep?"

Note: This is a 60% draft, so the constraint experiment might not be complete yet. That's fine—your feedback on the narrative itself helps the writer before they tackle compression.

### 7. Voice & Engagement

**Check if present**: ☐ The narrative has a distinctive voice and engages readers in the writer's experience

**What to notice**: Does the narrative sound like a real person telling their story? Does it draw you in? Or does it feel generic or distant?

**Generous response approach**:
- **Sayback**: "Your voice comes through most clearly when [specific moments]"
- **Pointing**: Point to passages where you felt most engaged or connected to the experience
- **Questioning**: "I'm curious about your feelings during [moment]—the narrative becomes more distant there, and I wonder what you were experiencing"

## General Guidance for Reviews

**Write for the writer, not the instructor**: Your feedback helps the peer writer improve their draft. Focus on what would be useful to know as a writer revising this work.

**Be specific**: Compare these responses:
- **Vague**: "The introduction needs work"
- **Specific**: "The introduction's first three sentences establish the skill you learned, but I wasn't sure why you chose this skill until paragraph 3—would it help to signal significance earlier?"

**Ask genuine questions**: Questions should invite development, not just test comprehension. "Why does this matter to you?" is more useful than "What skill did you learn?" (which is answerable from the text).

**Recognize 60% draft status**: This is a developing draft, not a final product. Focus feedback on larger concerns (focus, development, organization, detail) rather than sentence-level issues.

**Use generous protocol appropriately**: This isn't "only say nice things"—it's "prioritize understanding and exploration over judgment." You can note confusion, ask for development, or point to gaps while maintaining a generous, collaborative tone.

## After Writing Reviews

Remember to complete your **revision plan** by Friday 11:59pm (48 hours after reviews are due):

1. Rate each review you received (1-5 stars for helpfulness)
2. Sequence your revision priorities (what to address first, second, third)
3. Write 2-3 sentences explaining your revision approach

The revision plan is worth 15 points (in addition to the 25 points for writing reviews).
