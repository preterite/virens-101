# Peer Review Cycle 6: Documented Inquiry Criteria

> [!info] Review Cycle Details
> **Assignment**: Documented Inquiry (Research Essay)
> **Week**: 12
> **Protocol**: Evaluative (DES - Describe, Evaluate, Suggest)
> **Draft requirement**: 60% minimum complete (1080-1440 words of target 1800-2400)
> **Number of criteria**: 8

## Review Protocol: Evaluative (DES)

This cycle uses the **evaluative protocol** (Describe-Evaluate-Suggest). The Documented Inquiry is the most complex writing assignment in the course, integrating research sources with sustained analysis. Your reviews should assess how well the draft meets research writing standards and offer specific improvement strategies.

**Describe**: Identify what the writer is attempting to do  
**Evaluate**: Assess how well the draft meets the criterion  
**Suggest**: Offer specific strategies for improvement

This is your final peer review cycle—make your feedback count by being specific, direct, and actionable.

## Review Criteria

For each criterion below, check the box if the draft meets this standard, then write 2-4 sentences using the DES protocol. Focus on substantive issues that affect the essay's effectiveness as research-based writing.

### 1. Clear Research Question & Focus

**Check if present**: ☐ The essay establishes a clear research question or central inquiry that guides the analysis

**What to assess**: Can you identify what question the essay investigates? Does the essay maintain focus on this question throughout? Or does the focus remain unclear or shift unpredictably?

**Evaluative response approach**:
- **Describe**: "The research question appears to be [question you identify] / No clear question emerges"
- **Evaluate**: "This question effectively guides the analysis / The essay seems to address [multiple different questions] without clear focus"
- **Suggest**: "State your research question explicitly in the introduction" OR "Maintain focus on [original question] rather than shifting to [new question] in paragraph X"

### 2. Effective Integration of BEAM Sources

**Check if present**: ☐ The essay integrates sources from the BEAM portfolio effectively, using sources for their intended functions (Background, Exhibit, Argument, Method)

**What to assess**: Are sources integrated smoothly (not just dropped in)? Do they serve clear BEAM functions? Do Background sources establish context, Exhibits provide material to analyze, Arguments position the writer's thinking, Methods guide analysis?

**Evaluative response approach**:
- **Describe**: "Sources appear as [how they're integrated—smoothly woven in / dropped quotes / paraphrase without attribution]"
- **Evaluate**: "Source X effectively provides [BEAM function] when you [specific use] / Source Y seems randomly placed—unclear what function it serves"
- **Suggest**: "Introduce source X with a signal phrase explaining its relationship to your argument" OR "Use source Y's [specific content] to [appropriate BEAM function]"

### 3. Sustained Analysis (Not Just Summary)

**Check if present**: ☐ The essay analyzes sources and evidence rather than just summarizing what sources say

**What to assess**: Does the writer do analytical work (interpreting evidence, explaining significance, making connections, drawing conclusions)? Or primarily summarize sources without adding insight?

**Evaluative response approach**:
- **Describe**: "Analysis appears in [where you see it] / Most paragraphs summarize sources without analyzing them"
- **Evaluate**: "Your analysis of [evidence] effectively shows [insight] / Paragraph X summarizes three sources but doesn't explain what the summary means for your argument"
- **Suggest**: "After summarizing source X, add 2-3 sentences explaining: What does this evidence reveal? Why does it matter for your question?"

### 4. Clear Argument or Position

**Check if present**: ☐ The essay takes a clear position or makes an argument, not just reports information

**What to assess**: Can you identify what the writer argues or concludes? Do they have something at stake in the question? Or does the essay just survey sources without taking a position?

**Evaluative response approach**:
- **Describe**: "Your argument seems to be [position you identify] / The essay reports information without clear position"
- **Evaluate**: "This argument effectively addresses [research question] / I finish reading unsure what you actually think about [question]"
- **Suggest**: "State your position clearly in [introduction/conclusion]: Based on this research, you argue that..." OR "Make explicit what you think about [debated issue]—don't just present both sides"

### 5. Logical Organization & Structure

**Check if present**: ☐ The essay is organized logically with clear progression from introduction through body paragraphs to conclusion

**What to assess**: Can you follow the essay's development? Do paragraphs connect to each other? Does organization support the argument? Or does the essay jump between ideas without clear transitions?

**Evaluative response approach**:
- **Describe**: "Organization follows [structure you observe] / Essay jumps from [topic A] to [topic B] without connection"
- **Evaluate**: "This structure effectively builds toward [conclusion] / The organization makes it hard to follow because [specific problem]"
- **Suggest**: "Reorder paragraphs so [logic you propose]" OR "Add transitions explaining how [paragraph X] connects to [paragraph Y]"

### 6. Effective Introduction & Conclusion

**Check if present**: ☐ The introduction establishes context, significance, and research direction; the conclusion synthesizes findings and addresses implications

**What to assess**: Does the introduction engage readers and set up the inquiry? Does the conclusion do more than just summarize—does it answer "so what?" Or are introduction/conclusion weak, absent, or perfunctory?

**Evaluative response approach**:
- **Describe**: "Introduction provides [what you see] / Conclusion [what you observe]"
- **Evaluate**: "Introduction effectively establishes [strength] but could strengthen [weakness] / Conclusion answers 'so what?' by [how it does this] / Conclusion only summarizes without addressing implications"
- **Suggest**: "In introduction, add context about [what readers need to know]" OR "In conclusion, address: What changes if we understand [research finding]?"

### 7. Proper Citation & Documentation

**Check if present**: ☐ All sources are cited properly using MLA format, with both in-text citations and Works Cited entries

**What to assess**: Are sources consistently cited? Is MLA format correct? Are quotations and paraphrases attributed? Or are there missing citations, format errors, or unclear attribution?

**Evaluative response approach**:
- **Describe**: "In-text citations appear [consistently / inconsistently / not at all]; Works Cited [present / missing / incomplete]"
- **Evaluate**: "Citation format is generally correct / Multiple format errors including [specific issues]"
- **Suggest**: "Add in-text citations for [uncited material]" OR "Correct Works Cited format for [source type]" OR "Every paraphrase needs a citation—paragraph X uses source ideas without attribution"

### 8. Appropriate Scope & Depth

**Check if present**: ☐ The essay addresses the research question with appropriate scope (not too broad/narrow) and sufficient depth (not superficial)

**What to assess**: Is the scope manageable within essay length? Does the essay go deep enough to provide insight? Or is it too broad (can't address question adequately) or too shallow (obvious claims without development)?

**Evaluative response approach**:
- **Describe**: "Scope covers [breadth you observe]; depth reaches [level you assess]"
- **Evaluate**: "Scope is appropriate for essay length / Too broad—trying to address [multiple major questions] in limited space / Too narrow—could go deeper on [specific aspect]"
- **Suggest**: "Narrow focus to [specific aspect] to allow deeper analysis" OR "Expand discussion of [topic] with additional evidence and analysis"

## General Guidance for Reviews

**Prioritize substantive issues**: Focus on argument, analysis, source use, and organization before sentence-level concerns. Surface errors matter less than whether the essay works as research writing.

**Be specific about source integration problems**: If sources are poorly integrated, explain exactly what's wrong: "You quote Smith but don't explain how the quote supports your claim" is more useful than "source integration needs work."

**Distinguish summary from analysis**: Help the writer see where they're reporting what sources say versus interpreting what it means. Mark paragraphs that need more analytical work.

**Connect evaluation to research writing goals**: Reference the assignment's emphasis on sustained inquiry, BEAM integration, and taking a position. These aren't arbitrary requirements—they define what makes research writing effective.

**Acknowledge complexity**: This is the most challenging assignment in the course. Recognize what's working even as you identify what needs improvement. Balance helps writers know what to preserve during revision.

**Remember 60% draft status**: This is a substantial draft (1080-1440 words minimum) but still developing. Focus on whether core moves are present (question, sources, analysis, argument, organization) rather than perfection.

## After Writing Reviews

Remember to complete your **revision plan** by Friday 11:59pm (48 hours after reviews are due):

1. Rate each review you received (1-5 stars for helpfulness)
2. Sequence your revision priorities (what to address first, second, third)
3. Write 2-3 sentences explaining your revision approach

The revision plan is worth 15 points (in addition to the 25 points for writing reviews).

This is your final peer review cycle—use the revision plan to set priorities for completing your Documented Inquiry.
