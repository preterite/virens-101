## Review Protocol: Generous (SPQ)

This cycle uses the **generous protocol** (Sayback-Pointing-Questioning). Your feedback should help the writer understand how you experience their spec document as a potential collaborator or stakeholder, not evaluate whether it's "correct."

**Sayback**: Summarize your understanding of the project being specified<br/>
**Pointing**: Identify specific elements that are clear, helpful, or noticeable<br/>
**Questioning**: Ask genuine questions that help the writer develop the spec

Focus on clarity and completeness—what helps you understand the project? What leaves you uncertain?

---

## Review Criteria

For each criterion below, check the box if you observe this element in the draft, then write 2-4 sentences explaining what you noticed. Your explanation helps the writer see how readers experience their spec document.

### 1. Clear Project Purpose & Goals

**Check if present**: ☐ The spec articulates what the project is and why it matters

**What to notice**: Can you understand what the writer intends to create, build, organize, or accomplish? Do you understand why this project is worth doing? Or do you finish reading unsure what the project actually is?

**Generous response approach**:
- **Sayback**: "I understand the project to be [what you understand the project to be] with the goal of [purpose you understand]"
- **Pointing**: Point to passages where purpose comes through clearly
- **Questioning**: "I'm curious why this project matters to you—what motivates it beyond just completing the task?"

### 2. Identified Audience/Stakeholders

**Check if present**: ☐ The spec identifies who needs to understand or support this project

**What to notice**: Does the spec name its audience—who needs this information? Is it clear who the stakeholders are (instructor, collaborators, self, external parties)? Or is the audience implicit or unclear?

**Generous response approach**:
- **Sayback**: "The audience I'm seeing is [who you think needs this spec]"
- **Pointing**: Point to moments where audience awareness shows through
- **Questioning**: "Who else might need to understand this project? How would the spec change if written for [different stakeholder]?"

### 3. Specific Requirements/Features

**Check if present**: ☐ The spec lists concrete, actionable requirements for what the project must include or accomplish

**What to notice**: Are requirements specific enough to guide work ("must include 3 interviews, each 20-30 minutes") or vague ("should be high quality")? Can you tell what success requires? Or are requirements abstract or aspirational?

**Generous response approach**:
- **Sayback**: "The core requirements I'm seeing are [specific requirements you understood]"
- **Pointing**: Point to requirements that are especially clear or actionable
- **Questioning**: "When you say [vague requirement], what would that look like concretely? How would you know it's achieved?"

### 4. Acknowledged Constraints

**Check if present**: ☐ The spec identifies realistic constraints shaping the project (time, resources, expertise, access)

**What to notice**: Does the writer acknowledge limitations they're working within? Are constraints realistic and specific? Or does the spec ignore constraints, making the project seem easier than it likely is?

**Generous response approach**:
- **Sayback**: "The constraints you're navigating seem to be [constraints you noticed]"
- **Pointing**: Point to where constraint acknowledgment helps you understand project scope
- **Questioning**: "Are there other constraints affecting this project—access to materials, technical skills needed, cooperation from others?"

### 5. Measurable Success Criteria

**Check if present**: ☐ The spec provides specific criteria for determining whether the project succeeded

**What to notice**: Could you (or the writer) look at the finished project and determine success based on stated criteria? Or are criteria vague, unmeasurable, or absent?

**Generous response approach**:
- **Sayback**: "Success seems to mean [criteria you understand], which would be measurable by [how you'd measure it]"
- **Pointing**: Point to success criteria that are especially clear or useful
- **Questioning**: "How will you know if [aspect of project] succeeded? What evidence would show success?"

### 6. Realistic Timeline/Milestones

**Check if present**: ☐ The spec includes timeline or milestones showing when work will happen

**What to notice**: Is there a timeline? Are milestones specific (dates, sequence)? Does the timeline seem realistic given constraints? Or is timing vague or absent?

**Generous response approach**:
- **Sayback**: "Your timeline suggests [sequence or schedule you understood]"
- **Pointing**: Point to milestones that help you see project progression
- **Questioning**: "What needs to happen before [milestone X]? Is [timeframe] realistic given [constraint you noticed]?"

## General Guidance for Reviews

**Read as a potential collaborator**: Imagine you might need to understand or support this project. What information helps you? What leaves you uncertain?

**Focus on clarity and completeness**: Spec documents are communication tools. Good specs make intentions visible; weak specs leave stakeholders guessing. Your feedback helps the writer see what's clear and what needs development.

**Distinguish requirements from constraints**: Requirements are what the project must include; constraints are limitations shaping what's possible. Both matter, but they function differently. If a spec confuses these, your feedback can help clarify.

**Remember this is planning documentation**: Specs document thinking-in-progress, not finished work. It's fine (even good) to ask questions that push the writer to develop their thinking further.

**Recognize 60% draft status**: This is a developing spec. Focus on whether core elements (purpose, requirements, constraints, success criteria) are present and clear, not on polish.

## After Writing Reviews

Remember to complete your **revision plan** by Friday 11:59pm (48 hours after reviews are due):

1. Rate each review you received (1-5 stars for helpfulness)
2. Sequence your revision priorities (what to address first, second, third)
3. Write 2-3 sentences explaining your revision approach

The revision plan is worth 15 points (in addition to the 25 points for writing reviews).
