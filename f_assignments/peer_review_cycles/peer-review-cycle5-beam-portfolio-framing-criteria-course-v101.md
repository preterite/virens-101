# Peer Review Cycle 5: BEAM Portfolio Framing Criteria

> [!info] Review Cycle Details
> **Assignment**: BEAM Source Portfolio - Framing Statement
> **Week**: 10
> **Protocol**: Generous (SPQ - Sayback, Pointing, Questioning)
> **Draft requirement**: 60% minimum complete (180-300 words of target 300-500) plus source entries from Cycle 4
> **Number of criteria**: 7

## Review Protocol: Generous (SPQ)

This cycle uses the **generous protocol** (Sayback-Pointing-Questioning). The framing statement is where writers articulate their research thinking—their question, scope, and strategy. Your feedback should help writers see how readers understand their research project.

**Sayback**: Summarize your understanding of the research project  
**Pointing**: Identify specific elements that are clear, interesting, or noticeable  
**Questioning**: Ask genuine questions that help the writer develop their framing

Focus on clarity and coherence—what helps you understand the research project? What remains unclear?

---

## Review Criteria

For each criterion below, check the box if you observe this element in the draft, then write 2-4 sentences explaining what you noticed. Your explanation helps the writer see how their research project comes across to readers.

### 1. Clear Research Question

**Check if present**: ☐ The framing statement articulates a specific research question that guides the portfolio

**What to notice**: Can you identify the research question? Is it actually a question (not just a topic)? Does it seem focused enough to guide research? Or is the question absent, too broad, or unclear?

**Generous response approach**:
- **Sayback**: "I understand your research question to be: [question as you understand it]"
- **Pointing**: Point to where the question emerges most clearly
- **Questioning**: "Is your question [what you understood] or something more specific? What aspect of [broad topic] are you actually investigating?"

### 2. Explanation of Significance

**Check if present**: ☐ The framing statement explains why this research question matters—why it's worth investigating

**What to notice**: Does the writer explain significance (scholarly importance, personal interest, practical application, gap in understanding)? Or jump straight to research without establishing why it matters?

**Generous response approach**:
- **Sayback**: "The significance I'm hearing is that this research matters because [what you understood]"
- **Pointing**: Point to moments where motivation or importance comes through
- **Questioning**: "Why does this question interest you? Who else cares about this issue? What changes if we understand this better?"

### 3. Scope Definition

**Check if present**: ☐ The framing statement defines the scope of research—what's included and what's deliberately excluded

**What to notice**: Does the writer establish boundaries (timeframe, geography, specific aspects of topic, particular perspectives)? Or leave scope ambiguous?

**Generous response approach**:
- **Sayback**: "Your scope seems to focus on [boundaries you understood] while excluding [exclusions you noticed]"
- **Pointing**: Point to effective scope limitations that help focus the research
- **Questioning**: "Are you including [aspect that might be relevant]? Why focus on [included element] rather than [related element]?"

### 4. Research Strategy Description

**Check if present**: ☐ The framing statement describes the research strategy or approach—how the writer is investigating the question

**What to notice**: Does the writer explain their approach (types of sources they're seeking, analytical framework they're using, method they're following)? Or describe the question without explaining investigative approach?

**Generous response approach**:
- **Sayback**: "Your research strategy seems to involve [approach you understand]"
- **Pointing**: Point to where strategy becomes visible
- **Questioning**: "How are you finding sources? What kinds of sources will best address your question? Are you using any particular analytical framework?"

### 5. Connection to Source Entries

**Check if present**: ☐ The framing statement connects to the source entries—the sources shown align with the stated research question and strategy

**What to notice**: Do the source entries you reviewed in Cycle 4 (and any others you can see) fit the research project described in the framing? Or does there seem to be a disconnect between framing and actual sources?

**Generous response approach**:
- **Sayback**: "The sources I see ([titles/topics]) seem to connect to your research by [connection you noticed]"
- **Pointing**: Point to sources that particularly fit the research direction
- **Questioning**: "How does [source that seems tangential] connect to your research question? I'm not seeing the connection yet"

### 6. Appropriate Tone & Voice

**Check if present**: ☐ The framing statement maintains appropriate academic tone while showing the writer's genuine engagement with the research

**What to notice**: Does the tone balance professionalism with authentic interest? Or does it sound overly casual, overly stiff, or disengaged?

**Generous response approach**:
- **Sayback**: "The tone comes across as [how you'd describe it—engaged, formal, curious, etc.]"
- **Pointing**: Point to moments where voice is especially effective
- **Questioning**: "Your language becomes more formal when [observation]—is that intentional? Where does your own interest in this topic come through most clearly?"

### 7. Portfolio Coherence

**Check if present**: ☐ The framing statement, combined with the source entries, presents a coherent research portfolio with clear direction

**What to notice**: After reading the framing statement and seeing the sources, do you understand what research project is taking shape? Or do elements feel disconnected or scattered?

**Generous response approach**:
- **Sayback**: "The overall project seems to be investigating [big picture you understood] through [approach]"
- **Pointing**: Point to elements that help the portfolio cohere (repeated themes, complementary sources, clear progression)
- **Questioning**: "How does [element A] connect to [element B]? What holds this portfolio together?"

## General Guidance for Reviews

**Read the framing statement in context**: You're reviewing both the framing statement AND how it relates to the source entries you saw in Cycle 4. Does the framing match the sources?

**Focus on clarity of research thinking**: The framing statement documents research thinking-in-progress. Your feedback helps the writer see whether their thinking is clear to readers.

**Ask questions that develop the research**: Questions like "Why does this matter?" or "What are you excluding?" help the writer think more deeply about their project. These aren't tests—they're genuine inquiry.

**Recognize that research evolves**: The writer's research question might shift between now and the Documented Inquiry. That's normal. Focus on whether the current framing is clear, not whether it's perfect or final.

**Remember 60% draft status**: The framing statement might be incomplete (180-300 words vs. target 300-500). That's fine—focus on whether core elements (question, significance, scope, strategy) are present, even if brief.

## After Writing Reviews

Remember to complete your **revision plan** by Friday 11:59pm (48 hours after reviews are due):

1. Rate each review you received (1-5 stars for helpfulness)
2. Sequence your revision priorities (what to address first, second, third)
3. Write 2-3 sentences explaining your revision approach

The revision plan is worth 15 points (in addition to the 25 points for writing reviews).
