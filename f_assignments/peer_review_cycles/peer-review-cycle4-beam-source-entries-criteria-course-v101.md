# Peer Review Cycle 4: BEAM Source Entries Criteria

> [!info] Review Cycle Details
> **Assignment**: BEAM Source Portfolio - Individual Entries
> **Week**: 8
> **Protocol**: Evaluative (DES - Describe, Evaluate, Suggest)
> **Draft requirement**: At least 2 complete source entries (citation + BEAM classification + annotation)
> **Number of criteria**: 8

---

## Review Protocol: Evaluative (DES)

This cycle uses the **evaluative protocol** (Describe-Evaluate-Suggest). Your reviews assess how well individual source entries meet BEAM annotation standards and offer specific improvement strategies.

**Describe**: Identify what the writer is attempting with their source entries  
**Evaluate**: Assess how well entries meet citation, classification, and annotation standards  
**Suggest**: Offer specific strategies for strengthening entries

Focus on whether entries demonstrate research synthesis skills—understanding sources and articulating their rhetorical function.

---

## Review Criteria

For each criterion below, check the box if the draft meets this standard, then write 2-4 sentences using the DES protocol. You'll review at least 2 complete source entries (but the writer may submit more).

### 1. Complete MLA Citations

**Check if present**: ☐ Each source entry includes a complete, properly formatted MLA citation

**What to assess**: Are citations complete (author, title, publication, date, access info)? Do they follow MLA format? Or are citations incomplete, incorrectly formatted, or missing?

**Evaluative response approach**:
- **Describe**: "Citations for [sources] appear complete / Citations are missing [specific elements]"
- **Evaluate**: "MLA format is correct for [source type] / Format errors include [specific issues—missing period, wrong capitalization, incomplete access info]"
- **Suggest**: "Check MLA format for [source type—website, article, book] to correct [specific element]" OR "Ensure all sources include [missing information]"

### 2. Accurate BEAM Classification

**Check if present**: ☐ Each source is classified by BEAM function (Background, Exhibit, Argument, Method) based on how the writer plans to use it

**What to assess**: Do BEAM classifications match how the writer describes using the source in the annotation? Are classifications appropriate (source serving claimed function)? Or do classifications seem arbitrary or contradict annotation content?

**Evaluative response approach**:
- **Describe**: "You classify [source] as [BEAM function] and plan to use it for [purpose from annotation]"
- **Evaluate**: "This classification fits the described use / This classification doesn't match—you describe using it as [actual function] but classify it as [stated function]"
- **Suggest**: "Reclassify [source] as [appropriate function] given that you're [how they're using it]" OR "In your annotation, clarify how this source provides [claimed BEAM function]"

### 3. Source Diversity & BEAM Balance

**Check if present**: ☐ The submitted entries (even if only 2) show awareness of BEAM balance—not all the same function

**What to assess**: Do the 2+ entries represent different BEAM functions? Or are they all the same type (e.g., both Argument sources, no Background or Exhibit)?

**Evaluative response approach**:
- **Describe**: "Both entries are classified as [same function] / Entries represent [different functions]"
- **Evaluate**: "Having both as [same function] suggests your full portfolio might lack balance / This shows awareness of needing multiple BEAM functions"
- **Suggest**: "For your complete portfolio, ensure you include [missing BEAM functions] to support comprehensive research"

### 4. Annotations Explain Source Content

**Check if present**: ☐ Annotations explain what each source says or does—its main claims, findings, or material

**What to assess**: After reading the annotation, do you understand what the source is about? Or is the annotation vague about source content?

**Evaluative response approach**:
- **Describe**: "The annotation for [source] explains that it [content summary] / The annotation doesn't clearly explain source content"
- **Evaluate**: "This gives me clear understanding of what the source covers / I finish the annotation still unsure what the source actually says about [topic]"
- **Suggest**: "Add 2-3 sentences explaining the source's main [claims/findings/material] before explaining how you'll use it"

### 5. Annotations Explain Intended Use

**Check if present**: ☐ Annotations articulate how the writer plans to use each source in their research—not just what it says, but what it does for the research question

**What to assess**: Do annotations explain rhetorical use (what role the source plays)? Or just summarize content without explaining function?

**Evaluative response approach**:
- **Describe**: "You plan to use [source] for [intended use] / The annotation summarizes but doesn't explain intended use"
- **Evaluate**: "The intended use is clear and connects to [BEAM function] / Missing explanation of how this source serves your research question"
- **Suggest**: "Add sentences explaining: 'I'll use this source to [specific purpose in your research]'"

### 6. Connection to Research Question

**Check if present**: ☐ Annotations show how each source connects to the writer's research question or topic

**What to assess**: Can you see why these sources matter for this research? Or do sources seem randomly collected without clear connection to a guiding question?

**Evaluative response approach**:
- **Describe**: "These sources connect to research about [topic/question you infer] / No clear research question emerges from these entries"
- **Evaluate**: "The connection between sources and research focus is clear / I can't tell how [source] relates to your research direction"
- **Suggest**: "In each annotation, explicitly state how the source addresses [aspect of research question]" OR "Consider whether [source] actually serves your research—it seems tangential"

### 7. Appropriate Annotation Length

**Check if present**: ☐ Annotations are 150-250 words—substantial enough to explain content and use without becoming excessive

**What to assess**: Are annotations meeting minimum length (150 words)? Are they within maximum (250 words)? Or too brief/too long?

**Evaluative response approach**:
- **Describe**: "Annotation for [source] is approximately [word count estimate]"
- **Evaluate**: "Length is appropriate for developing both content summary and intended use / Too brief—needs more development of [content/use] / Too long—focus on essential information"
- **Suggest**: "Expand annotation to include [missing element] / Condense by focusing on [what matters most for your research]"

### 8. Critical Engagement (Beyond Summary)

**Check if present**: ☐ Annotations demonstrate critical thinking—noting source strengths, limitations, credibility, or how it compares to other sources

**What to assess**: Do annotations show analytical thinking (assessing source quality, noting gaps, comparing perspectives)? Or purely descriptive?

**Evaluative response approach**:
- **Describe**: "Critical engagement appears when [example] / Annotations are purely descriptive"
- **Evaluate**: "Your note about [limitation/strength] shows good critical assessment / Missing any evaluation of source quality or limitations"
- **Suggest**: "For each source, add 1-2 sentences noting: What are its strengths? Limitations? How does it compare to other sources on this topic?"

## General Guidance for Reviews

**Review each entry separately**: If the writer submitted 2 entries, give specific feedback on each. Don't just say "your annotations are good"—specify what works in Source 1 vs. Source 2.

**Check BEAM understanding**: If classifications seem wrong, explain why. Reference the BEAM framework to help the writer see how to classify by function rather than source type.

**Assess completeness for partial portfolios**: Since this reviews only 2+ entries (not full 8-12), comment on whether these entries suggest the writer understands the assignment. Are they on track?

**Focus on annotation quality**: The annotation is where synthesis skills show. Strong annotations explain both what sources say and how they'll be used. Weak annotations just summarize without explaining function.

**Note MLA accuracy without becoming the format police**: If there are clear format errors, note them. But don't obsess over comma placement. The goal is functional citations that readers can locate.

## After Writing Reviews

Remember to complete your **revision plan** by Friday 11:59pm (48 hours after reviews are due):

1. Rate each review you received (1-5 stars for helpfulness)
2. Sequence your revision priorities (what to address first, second, third)
3. Write 2-3 sentences explaining your revision approach

The revision plan is worth 15 points (in addition to the 25 points for writing reviews).
