## Overview

Process Archaeology is a retrospective analysis of your own composing processes across the semester, using evidence from your accumulated work—fragments, development logs, version histories, peer review feedback, revision plans—to examine how you wrote, what patterns characterized your practice, where difficulty arose, and what you learned about your own processes. Unlike reflective writing that relies on memory and impression, process archaeology treats your archived work as data to analyze systematically, using vocabulary from Don Norman's design theory (affordances, constraints, signifiers, feedback) to describe what you discover.

This portfolio component (1200-1800 words) demonstrates [[outcome-process-documentation|process documentation]] and [[outcome-composing-processes|composing processes]], showing your ability to analyze your own practice using evidence and conceptual frameworks. It completes the course's arc from producing process documentation (development logs, spec documents) to analyzing that documentation for insights about your composing practices.

## Context

Most composition courses ask students to reflect on their learning, typically in reflective cover letters or portfolio introductions. These reflections often rely on memory and generalization: "I improved my revision skills" or "I learned to use sources better." While these statements may be true, they're difficult to verify and don't reveal much about *how* improvement happened or what *specific practices* changed.

Process archaeology differs from traditional reflection by treating your accumulated work as archaeological site. Just as archaeologists examine artifacts to understand past societies, you'll examine your writing artifacts (fragments, logs, drafts, feedback) to understand your composing practices. This evidence-based approach makes claims verifiable: "My development logs show that I consistently wrote more productively in morning blocks than afternoon blocks" or "Feedback patterns across peer review cycles reveal that my introduction paragraphs improved but conclusion paragraphs remained weak."

Using Norman's design vocabulary (from Week 13 reading) provides conceptual tools for describing what you discover. Affordances are possibilities that tools or processes enable ("Index cards afforded physical manipulation and spatial organization"). Constraints are limitations that shape choices ("Word count constraints forced prioritization of claims"). Signifiers indicate how things work ("Eli Review's check-box criteria signified what to attend to"). Feedback shows results of actions ("Peer reviews provided feedback about whether my organization was clear"). These concepts help you move beyond vague reflection to precise analysis.

The assignment complements other portfolio components: Documented Inquiry shows your research thinking, System Map visualizes your workflow infrastructure, Transfer Proposal articulates what transfers beyond this course. Process Archaeology examines how all that work happened—the daily practices, patterns, struggles, and strategies that characterized your composing across 15 weeks.

## Task

Write a process archaeology of 1200-1800 words that analyzes your composing practices across the semester using evidence from your accumulated work (fragments, logs, drafts, feedback, revision plans), applies Norman's design vocabulary (affordances, constraints, signifiers, feedback) to describe patterns you discover, identifies specific moments when your process changed or when difficulty revealed something about your practice, and concludes with insights about your composing processes that have implications for future writing.

---

## Standards

This assignment demonstrates your developing abilities across multiple course outcomes:

1. **[[outcome-process-documentation|Process Documentation & Metacognition]]**: The archaeology itself is sophisticated metacognitive work—analyzing your own documented processes to understand them better
2. **[[outcome-composing-processes|Composing Processes]]**: Examining your practices across the semester reveals what composing processes you've developed and how they evolved
3. **[[outcome-critical-thinking|Critical Thinking & Difficulty-as-Diagnostic]]**: Analyzing moments of difficulty using difficulty-as-diagnostic framework shows understanding that struggle is informational
4. **[[outcome-constraint-literacy|Constraint Literacy]]**: Examining how constraints shaped your work demonstrates understanding of constraints as design parameters, not just obstacles
5. **Evidence-based analysis**: Claims about your processes are supported with specific evidence from your archived work—not just memory or impression
6. **Norman vocabulary application**: You use affordances, constraints, signifiers, and feedback accurately to describe your composing infrastructure and practices
7. **Pattern recognition**: You identify patterns across time—not just describing individual instances but recognizing what repeated or evolved
8. **Honest assessment**: You acknowledge both productive and problematic patterns—process archaeology isn't about celebrating success but understanding practice
9. **Actionable insights**: Your conclusions suggest specific implications for future writing—not just "I'll work harder" but concrete practices to maintain, modify, or develop

Assessment:
- As portfolio component, assessed through portfolio rubric examining metacognitive depth, evidence use, and analytical sophistication
- No separate peer review (but process prep fragment provides opportunity for early thinking)

See [[grading-assessment-content-v101|Grading & Assessment]] for portfolio assessment details.

## Guidance

**Gather your evidence first**. Before writing, collect your development logs, fragment archive, peer review feedback, revision plans, and any other documentation of your composing work. You can't do archaeology without artifacts. Organize this material chronologically or thematically so you can identify patterns.

**Look for patterns, not just individual examples**. Process archaeology reveals what repeated or evolved over time. Compare these approaches:

*Individual example*: "In Week 5, I struggled with the Literacy Narrative introduction."

*Pattern identification*: "Across all six peer review cycles, reviewers consistently noted that my introduction paragraphs lacked context. This pattern suggests I tend to begin writing before fully articulating why readers should care about my topic."

The pattern reveals something systematic about your practice that individual examples can't show.

**Use Norman's vocabulary precisely**. Don't just drop terms in randomly—apply them accurately:

- **Affordances**: What did tools/processes make possible? ("Eli Review afforded anonymized peer feedback, which made me more willing to provide honest evaluations.")
- **Constraints**: What shaped your choices? ("The 300-word constraint for compressed literacy narrative forced me to eliminate contextual detail and focus only on key moments.")
- **Signifiers**: What indicated how things worked? ("The check-box criteria in peer review signified what 'good' looked like for each assignment.")
- **Feedback**: What showed you results of actions? ("Revision plan completion rates provided feedback about whether I was processing peer commentary thoughtfully.")

These concepts describe your composing infrastructure—the designed environment you worked within.

**Apply difficulty-as-diagnostic thinking**. When you encountered difficulty, what did that reveal? Maybe writing reading-anchored fragments felt harder than open-topic fragments—that difficulty suggests something about your relationship to sources worth examining. Maybe you consistently struggled in the first 10 minutes of writing blocks—that difficulty might reveal that you need warm-up time. Treat difficulty as data, not failure.

**Mine your development logs systematically**. If you maintained logs documenting "what I did / what happened / what I learned," those logs contain rich data about your practice. Look for: What times of day did you write most effectively? What pre-writing strategies actually helped? When did you get stuck, and what got you unstuck? What patterns appear across logs that you didn't notice while writing them?

**Be honest about problematic patterns**. Process archaeology isn't just celebrating what worked—it's understanding what happened. If you procrastinated consistently, if peer feedback didn't change your revision practices, if certain fragment types frustrated you throughout the semester, acknowledge those patterns and think about what they reveal. Honest assessment is more valuable than self-congratulation.

**Connect to specific portfolio work**. Reference your Documented Inquiry, System Map, or selected fragments when relevant: "The Documented Inquiry's research pathway shows how I followed citation trails rather than relying only on database searches, demonstrating the practice I documented in my Week 9 development log." These connections create portfolio coherence.

**Conclude with actionable insights**. What have you learned about your composing processes that matters for future writing? These insights should be specific: "I write more effectively when I start with questions rather than claims" or "I need to build in time for walking between drafting and revising—immediate revision doesn't let me see what I actually wrote" or "Physical tools (index cards, paper drafts) work better for me than purely digital processes for brainstorming and organization."
