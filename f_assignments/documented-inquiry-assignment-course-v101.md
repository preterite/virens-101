## Overview

The Documented Inquiry is a major component of your final portfolio, representing the culmination of research work begun in Movement 3 with your Annotated Bibliography. Unlike traditional research papers that aim to prove a predetermined thesis, documented inquiry emphasizes the research process itself—tracing how you engaged with sources, what questions emerged, how your thinking evolved, and where inquiry might lead next. The "documented" aspect means you make your research pathway visible rather than presenting conclusions as if they appeared fully formed.

This assignment draws on your BEAM-analyzed source collection, builds on fragments written throughout ![[_def-M4-weeks]], and demonstrates [[outcome-rhetorical-awareness|rhetorical awareness]] through dialogic engagement with sources (treating sources as conversation partners rather than just support for claims). Your Documented Inquiry will be 1800-2500 words and receives peer review in Week 12 (Cycle 6, evaluative protocol).

## Context

Traditional research papers in composition courses often follow a formula: state thesis, marshal supporting evidence, address counterarguments, conclude by restating thesis. This structure has pedagogical value—it teaches organization, source integration, argumentation—but it can also reinforce problematic assumptions: that research means finding sources to support pre-existing beliefs, that good writing hides the messy thinking that leads to conclusions, that the researcher's job is to appear authoritative rather than genuinely inquiring.

Documented inquiry reframes research writing around genuine questions and visible pathways. You begin not with answers but with curiosity, confusion, or contradictions you've noticed in your source reading. You engage with sources dialogically—considering what they claim, examining their evidence, noticing where they disagree with each other, and thinking about what questions their work raises. You document how your thinking changes as you read and compare sources. You conclude not necessarily with definitive answers but with refined understanding and new questions worth pursuing.

This approach aligns with how scholarly research actually works: researchers rarely start with firm conclusions and find supporting sources; they start with questions, discover complications, revise their understanding, and often conclude with better questions than they began with. Your Documented Inquiry demonstrates this intellectual honesty while still meeting expectations for source-based academic writing—clear organization, purposeful integration, analytical depth, proper citation.

The assignment builds directly on your Annotated Bibliography. You've already analyzed sources through BEAM framework, identified patterns and conflicts, and articulated research questions. Now you develop one of those questions (or a refinement of one) by bringing sources into conversation with each other and with your own thinking. This demonstrates [[outcome-textual-accumulation|textual accumulation]]—earlier work becomes foundation for current work rather than being discarded.

---

## Task

Write a documented inquiry of 1800-2500 words that traces your investigation of a research question, incorporating 6-10 sources from your Annotated Bibliography, making your research pathway visible by acknowledging how your thinking evolved, engaging sources dialogically by examining their claims and evidence rather than just summarizing, using BEAM distinctions to integrate sources purposefully, and concluding with refined understanding and/or additional questions worth pursuing.

## Standards

This assignment demonstrates your developing abilities across multiple course outcomes:

1. **[[outcome-rhetorical-awareness|Rhetorical Awareness]]**: Dialogic source engagement shows understanding that sources are rhetorical—they make choices about claims, evidence, organization, and emphasis based on purposes and audiences
2. **[[outcome-critical-thinking|Critical Thinking & Difficulty-as-Diagnostic]]**: Examining source conflicts, questioning evidence, recognizing complications demonstrates critical engagement rather than passive acceptance
3. **[[outcome-textual-accumulation|Textual Accumulation]]**: The inquiry builds on Annotated Bibliography work and incorporates fragments written across the semester
4. **[[outcome-composing-processes|Composing Processes]]**: Making research pathway visible shows revision of thinking as central to composing, not just cleanup afterward
5. **[[outcome-process-documentation|Process Documentation]]**: Documented inquiry itself is a form of process documentation—showing how understanding developed through source engagement
6. **Focused inquiry**: The piece investigates a clear question or problem, not just reports on a broad topic
7. **Source integration**: Sources are integrated purposefully using BEAM distinctions—Background for context, Exhibit for evidence, Argument for claims to engage, Method for frameworks
8. **Dialogic engagement**: Sources are treated as conversation partners—you explain what they claim, examine their evidence, consider their limitations, and think about how they relate to each other
9. **Visible pathway**: You acknowledge when sources complicated your thinking, when you changed your mind, when questions emerged—making research process visible rather than presenting conclusions as inevitable
10. **Proper citation**: All sources cited in MLA format (or approved alternative) with accurate in-text citations and works cited

Assessment:
- As portfolio component, assessed through portfolio rubric examining research skills, source integration, and analytical depth
- Receives peer review in Week 12 (Cycle 6, evaluative protocol) before portfolio submission

## Guidance

**Start with a genuine question, not a predetermined answer**. The best documented inquiries emerge from real curiosity: "Why do these three sources reach different conclusions about X?" or "What happens when I apply this framework to that phenomenon?" or "How did thinking about Y change between 2010 and 2020?" If you already know your conclusion before engaging sources, you're writing a traditional argument essay (which is valuable but different from documented inquiry).

**Make your research pathway visible without excessive narration**. You don't need to report every search you conducted or every source you read. But do acknowledge key moments: "Initially I assumed X, but Source A's evidence suggested Y might be more accurate" or "Sources B and C both address this question but reach opposite conclusions because they define the key term differently." These moments show thinking in motion.

**Engage sources dialogically, not just summarily**. Compare these two approaches:

*Summary approach*: "Johnson argues that social media increases anxiety (45). Smith claims social media decreases isolation (23)."

*Dialogic approach*: "Johnson's longitudinal study finds correlation between social media use and self-reported anxiety, but the strength of correlation varies significantly by platform and age group (45). Smith's cross-sectional study emphasizes reduced isolation among users, though Smith acknowledges this benefit doesn't apply to passive scrolling (23). The methodological difference—longitudinal versus cross-sectional—might explain their seemingly contradictory findings."

The dialogic approach examines *how* sources make claims and *why* they might differ, treating sources as complex rather than just quotable.

**Use BEAM strategically**. Your Annotated Bibliography already tagged sources through BEAM. Now use those tags to integrate sources purposefully: Background sources establish context early, Exhibit sources provide data to analyze, Argument sources give you claims to agree with, extend, or dispute, Method sources offer frameworks for analysis. Thoughtful BEAM use creates coherent progression rather than random source parade.

**Draw on your corpus of fragments**. You've written 40+ fragments this semester. Many contain thinking relevant to your inquiry. Mine your corpus for material—a reading response fragment might become a paragraph analyzing a source, a difficulty fragment might reveal where your thinking changed, an open-topic fragment might contain examples or observations relevant to your question. This demonstrates textual accumulation in action.

**Conclude honestly**. Documented inquiry can conclude with: partial answers plus new questions, refined understanding of the problem's complexity, recognition that different contexts require different approaches, or identification of what evidence would be needed to reach firmer conclusions. You don't need definitive answers—you need intellectual honesty about where inquiry has led and where it might go next.

**Polish for portfolio**. Because this piece appears in your final portfolio, invest in revision after peer review. Strengthen source integration, clarify your pathway, tighten organization, proofread carefully. This is summative work—it represents your best thinking and writing, not just completion of an assignment.
