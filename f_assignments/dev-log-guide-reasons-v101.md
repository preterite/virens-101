## Design Rationale

The development log (dev log) operationalizes Course Outcome 7 (Process Documentation and Metacognition) by requiring students to maintain ongoing records of their writing work. The three-part structure—What I Did, What Happened, What I Learned—scaffolds metacognitive reflection without over-constraining the content.

### Why "Dev Log" and Not "Journal" or "Reflection"?

The term "development log" is borrowed deliberately from software engineering, where developers maintain logs of work performed, problems encountered, and solutions discovered. This vocabulary choice:

1. **Signals professional practice.** Students learn that process documentation is standard in knowledge work, not a school-only exercise.

2. **Emphasizes development over expression.** "Journal" connotes personal writing; "reflection" connotes introspection. "Dev log" connotes work-in-progress documentation. The focus is on the writing process developing, not on the student's feelings.

3. **Connects to course frameworks.** The dev log parallels the six moves' emphasis on systematic information management. It's a capture-and-route system for process knowledge.

4. **Prepares for transfer.** Students who understand dev logs as professional practice are more likely to adapt the habit to future contexts (research logs, project documentation, learning journals in other courses).

### The Three-Part Structure

The What I Did / What Happened / What I Learned structure derives from several sources:

**Military after-action reviews:** The U.S. Army's AAR process distinguishes between "what was supposed to happen," "what actually happened," and "why the difference." The dev log simplifies this to action, result, and learning.

**Reflective practice (Schön):** Donald Schön's distinction between reflection-in-action and reflection-on-action suggests that practitioners improve by articulating what they did and what they learned from it. The dev log provides a structure for reflection-on-action.

**Metacognitive research:** Studies on metacognition consistently show that learners improve when they explicitly articulate their thinking processes. The three-part structure ensures students move beyond "I worked on my essay" to specific observations about process.

## Theoretical Grounding

### Metacognition and Transfer

The primary theoretical warrant for the dev log comes from research on metacognition and learning transfer.

**Yancey [[@yancey1998refle]], Robertson, and Taczak** (*Writing Across Contexts*, 2014) demonstrate that metacognitive reflection—specifically, explicit attention to what was learned and how it might apply elsewhere—significantly improves students' ability to transfer writing knowledge to new contexts. Their "Teaching for Transfer" curriculum centers on systematic reflection about writing concepts and practices.

The dev log operationalizes this finding by requiring regular, structured reflection. By Week 14, students have 12-15 entries documenting how their process developed—concrete evidence they can analyze for patterns and growth.

**Key mechanism:** Transfer requires *recognition* ("I've seen something like this before") and *application* ("I can use what I learned there here"). The dev log builds recognition by making past process visible and retrievable.

### Process Documentation as Evidence

Traditional composition pedagogy values process but rarely documents it systematically. Students are told that writing is recursive, that revision matters, that struggle is normal—but these claims remain abstract without evidence.

The dev log creates **auditable process evidence**:
- Students can point to specific entries when discussing their development
- Portfolio reflections cite dev log entries rather than relying on memory
- Instructors gain insight into student process without surveillance

**Course principle:** "Archives enable analytics." The dev log is an archive of process that enables later analysis—by the student in portfolio reflection, by the instructor in conferences, by both parties in assessing growth.

### Failure-as-Diagnostic

Course Outcome 2 (Critical Thinking and Difficulty-as-Diagnostic) frames difficulty as informational rather than deficient. The dev log provides a place to document difficulty without stigma.

The "What Happened" section explicitly invites unexpected outcomes, struggles, and failures. By normalizing documentation of difficulty, the dev log:
- Reduces shame around struggle
- Creates data for diagnosing recurring problems
- Models that professional writers encounter and document difficulties

**Design choice:** The sample entries in the student guide include an example of "getting stuck" that reframes organizing as "routing—a real move, not procrastination" while also noting potential avoidance. This models honest, non-judgmental process analysis.

### Writing-as-Verb and Writing-as-Noun

The dev log captures writing-as-verb (process, labor) in a form that becomes writing-as-noun (archived text, capital). Each entry freezes a moment of process into retrievable documentation.

This parallels the course's broader framework:
- Daily writing generates fragments (verb → noun)
- Dev logs generate process evidence (verb → noun)
- Both accumulate into the portfolio (capital)

The dev log thus embodies the labor-capital dialectic at the meta-level: the labor of reflection produces capital (documentation) that can be reinvested in future reflection (portfolio cover letter) and future work (transfer to other contexts).

## Implementation Approach

### Frequency and Volume

**Target:** 12-15 entries across the semester, roughly twice per week.

**Rationale:** 
- Frequent enough to capture meaningful variation in process
- Infrequent enough to avoid feeling like busywork
- Produces sufficient data for pattern recognition in portfolio reflection

**Flexibility:** Students choose when to log. Suggested moments: after significant writing sessions, after peer review, after receiving feedback, when stuck. This honors different working rhythms while ensuring regular documentation.

### Completion-Based Grading

**Decision:** Dev logs are graded on completion (did you do it with genuine engagement?) rather than quality (how insightful were your observations?).

**Rationale:**

1. **Process docs are tools, not performances.** The dev log serves the student's own learning. Grading for quality risks turning it into a performance for the instructor rather than genuine self-documentation.

2. **Quality emerges from practice.** Students who maintain logs consistently develop better metacognitive awareness over time. The habit matters more than the brilliance of any single entry.

3. **Reduces gaming.** Quality-graded reflection incentivizes "fake insight"—claims of learning that sound good but don't reflect actual experience. Completion-grading reduces this pressure.

4. **Aligns with labor-based principles.** Following Inoue's [[@inoue2019labos]] labor-based grading philosophy, the dev log rewards the labor of reflection rather than the product of that labor.

**Counterargument addressed:** "Won't students just phone it in?" The guide specifies that "genuine engagement" is required and that "I did stuff, it happened, I learned things" repeated for every entry doesn't count. Spot-checking during conferences and portfolio review catches disengaged entries.

### Integration with Portfolio

The dev log is not standalone—it feeds directly into portfolio assessment:

1. **Evidence for reflective cover letter:** Students cite specific dev log entries when discussing their development. "In my Week 5 entry, I noticed I was struggling with..." replaces vague claims about growth.

2. **Pattern recognition:** Students review all entries before writing their portfolio reflection, identifying recurring themes, persistent difficulties, and evidence of change.

3. **Instructor insight:** Dev logs help instructors understand portfolio artifacts. A polished final piece means more when the dev log shows the struggle that produced it.

### Vocabulary Integration

The student guide encourages (but doesn't require) use of course vocabulary:
- Process stages: generating, drafting, revising, editing, etc.
- Six moves: capture, classify, route, connect, distill, publish

**Rationale:** Using shared vocabulary makes observations more precise and reinforces course concepts. But mandating terminology risks turning logs into exercises in correct word use rather than genuine reflection.

**Design choice:** The guide says vocabulary "helps" and "makes observations more precise" rather than requiring it. Students who find the vocabulary useful will adopt it; those who don't won't be penalized.

## Competing Values & Tradeoffs

### Surveillance vs. Support

**The tension:** Any required documentation of work process can feel like surveillance. Students may resent being asked to account for their time and activities.

**The resolution:** 
- Frame dev logs as tools for the student, not reports for the instructor
- Grade on completion, not quality, to reduce performance pressure
- Emphasize that dev logs are evidence *for* students to use in their own reflections
- In conferences, use dev logs collaboratively ("What do you notice in your entries?") rather than evaluatively ("Why didn't you work more?")

### Structure vs. Authenticity

**The tension:** The three-part structure scaffolds reflection but may constrain authentic response. What if a student's experience doesn't fit the template?

**The resolution:**
- The structure is a scaffold, not a straitjacket. Students can adapt it.
- The guide includes a "minimum viable entry" example showing that brief, informal entries are acceptable.
- The "What I Learned" section accepts any kind of insight—about writing, process, material, tools, or self.

### Time Investment vs. Return

**The tension:** Dev logs take time that could be spent writing. Is the metacognitive benefit worth the labor cost?

**The resolution:**
- 150-250 words per entry is roughly 10-15 minutes of writing
- Twice per week = 20-30 minutes total
- This is modest compared to the return: concrete evidence for portfolio reflection, transferable metacognitive habits, pattern recognition that improves future process

**Research support:** Studies on learning journals consistently show that modest time investments in reflection produce disproportionate gains in learning and transfer.

### Fake Reflection Risk

**The tension:** Students may write what they think instructors want to hear rather than documenting actual experience.

**The resolution:**
- Completion-grading reduces pressure to perform insight
- Spot-checking in conferences catches patterns of disengagement
- Portfolio reflection requires citing specific entries—vague logs produce weak evidence
- The guide explicitly addresses "Is this just busywork?" to preempt cynicism

**Accepted risk:** Some students will still produce performative rather than genuine entries. This is true of any reflective assignment. The design minimizes but cannot eliminate this risk.

## Evidence & Iteration

### Evidence to Collect

- [ ] Do students use dev logs as evidence in portfolio reflections? (Citation frequency, specificity)
- [ ] Do dev log entries show increasing specificity and metacognitive depth over the semester?
- [ ] In conferences, can students identify patterns in their own entries?
- [ ] Do students report finding dev logs useful (end-of-semester survey)?
- [ ] Does completion rate remain high, or does engagement drop after initial weeks?

### Revision Notes

[Space for post-pilot observations]

**Watch for:**
- Entries becoming formulaic or repetitive—may need mid-semester prompt variation
- Students logging too infrequently—may need more explicit checkpoint reminders
- Confusion about what counts as "genuine engagement"—may need clearer examples
- Resistance to vocabulary use—if widespread, reconsider integration approach
