## Design Rationale

The Transfer Proposal, completed on the final day of semester (Week 15, Block 6), asks students to articulate which practices, concepts, or understandings from English 101 will transfer to future writing contexts and how those elements will need adaptation. This forward-looking document (600-900 words) distinguishes itself from traditional retrospective reflection by requiring students to project toward specific future contexts while grounding projections in portfolio evidence. The assignment operationalizes transfer theory's insight that transfer doesn't happen automatically—it requires metacognitive awareness and deliberate application.

Three pedagogical goals drive this design:

1. **Transfer as explicit planning**: Making transfer explicit through written proposal increases likelihood that students will actually recognize and pursue transfer opportunities in future contexts, rather than passively hoping skills somehow transfer.

2. **Context-aware adaptation**: Requiring students to think about how practices adapt to new contexts prevents misconception that transfer means doing exactly the same thing—it means strategic adaptation to new purposes, audiences, and constraints.

3. **Portfolio synthesis**: The proposal asks students to draw on all portfolio work as evidence, creating synthesis across components (fragments, Process Archaeology, Documented Inquiry, System Map) while identifying what matters most going forward.

The assignment's final-day timing is purposeful: it completes the portfolio by looking forward while the semester's work is still fresh, and positions students to carry conscious intentions into future writing rather than leaving transfer to chance.

## Theoretical Grounding

### Transfer Theory

**Anne Beaufort's [[@beaufort2007colle]] framework for transfer** (*College Writing and Beyond*, 2007) provides foundational understanding that transfer requires both varied practice and metacognitive awareness. Beaufort tracked undergraduate and professional writers, finding that successful transfer involves: (1) developing portable knowledge through varied writing tasks, (2) building meta-level awareness of writing strategies and contexts, (3) recognizing similarities and differences between writing situations, and (4) adapting strategies appropriately to new contexts.

Transfer Proposal operationalizes all four elements. Students review varied writing from the semester (fragments, assignments, process docs), develop meta-level awareness by articulating what practices they've developed, recognize that future contexts will differ from English 101, and think explicitly about how adaptation will be necessary. This structured metacognitive work increases transfer likelihood.

Beaufort also emphasizes that transfer isn't guaranteed by good instruction—students can succeed in first-year composition without recognizing transferable elements. Explicit attention to transfer, as this proposal requires, addresses this problem by making students conscious of what might transfer and how.

**Kathleen Blake Yancey's [[@yancey1998refle]] "Teaching for Transfer" work** (with Liane Robertson and Kara Taczak, *Writing Across Contexts*, 2014) demonstrates that courses explicitly teaching for transfer—making transfer goals explicit, providing varied practice, developing metalanguage about writing, encouraging reflection on connections—produce better transfer outcomes than courses treating transfer implicitly. Transfer Proposal implements these principles: it makes transfer explicit, asks students to connect course concepts to future contexts, uses course metalanguage (BEAM, constraint sequencing, textual accumulation, difficulty-as-diagnostic), and requires reflection on how practices apply beyond English 101.

Yancey's research also shows that forward-looking reflection supports transfer better than purely backward-looking reflection. Students who articulate "what I will do with this knowledge" transfer more effectively than students who only articulate "what I learned." Transfer Proposal's forward orientation—"what transfers and how"—implements this finding.

**Elizabeth Wardle's [[@downs2007teaci]] work on "mutt genres" and transfer** ("Understanding 'Transfer' from FYC: Preliminary Results of a Longitudinal Study," 2007; "'Mutt Genres' and the Goal of FYC," 2009) cautions that some composition course genres (the five-paragraph essay, the "research paper") are specific to composition courses and don't transfer well to disciplinary or professional writing. Wardle advocates teaching portable concepts and strategies rather than course-specific genres.

Transfer Proposal addresses this concern by asking students to identify what's portable—not "I can write English 101 essays" but "I can maintain process documentation, analyze constraint effects, and adapt strategies to genre requirements." These portable concepts and strategies transfer more effectively than genre formulas.

### Metacognition Research

**David Perkins and Gavriel Salomon's work on transfer mechanisms** ("Teaching for Transfer," 1988; "Transfer of Learning," 1992) distinguishes between near transfer (applying knowledge in similar contexts) and far transfer (applying knowledge in quite different contexts). They argue that far transfer requires abstraction—recognizing general principles from specific instances. Transfer Proposal encourages this abstraction by asking students to identify general practices (maintaining process documentation, analyzing source functions) that apply across varied contexts rather than treating each English 101 assignment as unique and disconnected.

**Rebecca Nowacek's work on transfer as reconstruction** (*Agents of Integration*, 2011) demonstrates that successful transfer involves active reconstruction of knowledge for new contexts, not passive transportation. Students don't just "use BEAM in biology"—they recognize how BEAM helps them analyze source function, then adapt that analytical framework to biology's specific citation practices and genre expectations. Transfer Proposal's emphasis on adaptation (not just replication) honors this understanding.

## Implementation Approach

### Evidence Requirement

Requiring students to ground transfer claims in portfolio evidence prevents the proposal from becoming wishful thinking. Students must point to specific portfolio work demonstrating they've developed the practices they claim will transfer: "My Documented Inquiry shows I can integrate sources dialogically, as evidenced in paragraphs 4-6 where I examine competing claims about X." This evidence requirement creates accountability—students can't claim to transfer skills they haven't actually developed.

The evidence also makes transfer concrete. Rather than vague "I'm a better writer now," students must identify specific evidence of specific practices, which helps them recognize what actually changed across the semester.

### Specificity About Future Contexts

Requiring students to name specific future contexts (courses, workplaces, projects) rather than generic "other classes" serves multiple purposes:

1. **Realistic planning**: Naming actual courses helps students think concretely about what those contexts require, not just assume English 101 skills transfer automatically.

2. **Differentiation**: Different future contexts need different adaptations—lab reports need different practices than creative writing, business communication needs different approaches than literary analysis. Specificity enables thinking about appropriate adaptation.

3. **Motivation**: Transfer proposals that name contexts students actually anticipate (business internships, graduate school applications, creative projects) feel more meaningful than hypothetical scenarios.

The guidance acknowledges students might not know exact future contexts but encourages as much specificity as possible within realistic uncertainty.

### Adaptation Emphasis

The requirement to think about adaptation—not just replication—addresses common transfer misconception that learning transfers unchanged. Research shows transfer requires strategic modification for new contexts. By explicitly asking "How does this practice need to adapt?" the proposal helps students develop transfer mindset: recognize portable elements, analyze new context's demands, adapt practice appropriately.

This adaptation thinking also prevents formulaic transfer where students try to force English 101 approaches into contexts where they don't fit. Better to adapt constraint sequencing principles to new genres than to rigidly apply English 101 assignment structure.

## Competing Values & Tradeoffs

### Forward-Looking vs. Retrospective

**Tension**: Traditional portfolio reflection is retrospective (what did I learn?). Transfer Proposal is prospective (what will I use?). Does prospective focus sacrifice reflective depth?

**Resolution**: The proposal requires both—grounding forward projections in retrospective review of portfolio work. Students must understand what they learned (retrospective) to articulate what transfers (prospective). The synthesis creates richer metacognitive work than pure retrospection or speculation alone.

### Brief Length vs. Comprehensive Coverage

**Tension**: 600-900 words is brief for addressing seven course outcomes plus multiple future contexts. Does brevity force superficiality?

**Resolution**: Brevity encourages prioritization—students must identify what matters most rather than comprehensively cataloging everything learned. This prioritization itself is valuable metacognitive work. Three to five strong transfer claims with evidence and adaptation analysis provide more insight than shallow treatment of everything.

The brevity also respects students' cognitive load on the final day of semester while ensuring transfer thinking happens explicitly rather than being skipped due to time pressure.

### Prediction Uncertainty

**Tension**: Students can't perfectly predict future writing contexts or how well transfer will work. Does asking for predictions set them up for inaccurate claims?

**Resolution**: The guidance explicitly acknowledges uncertainty, encouraging honest statements like "I think X will help with Y, though I'm not sure exactly how." This honesty is more valuable than false confidence. The goal isn't perfect prediction but conscious intention—students who articulate transfer possibilities are more likely to recognize and pursue them than students who never think about transfer explicitly.

## Evidence & Iteration

### Evidence to Collect

- [ ] **Transfer specificity**: Do students identify concrete practices and contexts, or remain vague?
- [ ] **Evidence grounding**: Are claims supported with portfolio examples, or unsupported?
- [ ] **Adaptation thinking**: Do students acknowledge practices need adaptation, or assume direct replication?
- [ ] **Outcome coverage**: Which outcomes do students most frequently identify as transferable? Which are rarely mentioned?
- [ ] **Context variety**: Do students consider only academic transfer, or also workplace/civic/personal contexts?
- [ ] **Long-term outcomes**: In future research, do students actually pursue transfer opportunities they articulated? (Requires longitudinal study beyond first semester.)

### Revision Notes

**First-pilot questions**:
- Is 600-900 words appropriate length for transfer thinking with evidence, or should it be longer?
- Does final-day timing work logistically, or would earlier submission allow more thoughtful completion?
- Do students understand transfer as adaptation, or still think it means doing same thing in new context?
- Which course outcomes do students most often identify as transferable? Does this reveal what's genuinely portable versus course-specific?
- Would examples of strong transfer proposals help students understand expectations, or is guidance sufficient?
