## Design Rationale

Movement 2's milestone combines two assignments—Specification Document (25 points) and Constraint Audit (25 points)—that work together conceptually while developing distinct skills. The Spec Document introduces process documentation as a compositional practice, asking students to articulate intentions and requirements before creating something. The Constraint Audit develops analytical skills, asking students to examine how constraints shape existing texts, processes, or systems. Together, these assignments establish constraint literacy from two directions: production (articulating constraints you'll work within) and analysis (identifying constraints at work in what already exists).

This pairing addresses three pedagogical goals:

1. **Process documentation as genre**: Many composition courses teach reflection *about* process but not documentation *of* process as it unfolds. Spec documents model prospective documentation—writing that captures thinking before and during creation, not just retrospective analysis afterward.

2. **Constraint as analytical lens**: Traditional rhetorical analysis focuses on persuasion and audience. Constraint audit offers a complementary analytical approach: examining how limitations (genre, audience, resources, technology, time) shape what's possible. This analytical framework transfers well—students can apply constraint thinking to any designed object or system.

3. **Replacement of traditional rhetorical analysis**: The Constraint Audit functions as Movement 2's analytical writing assignment, filling the role that rhetorical analysis occupies in traditional composition sequences. By framing analysis through constraints rather than (or in addition to) rhetorical appeals, the assignment connects to course themes while maintaining the analytical rigor expected in first-year composition.

The separated peer review (Spec Document in Week 6 with generous protocol, Constraint Audit in Week 7 with evaluative protocol) recognizes that these assignments need different kinds of feedback: specs benefit from reader response about clarity and completeness; audits benefit from criteria-based evaluation of analytical depth and evidence.

## Theoretical Grounding

### Design Theory & Systems Thinking

**Christopher Alexander's [[@alexander1964notet]] work on design constraints** (*Notes on the Synthesis of Form*, 1964) provides the primary theoretical foundation for both assignments. Alexander argues that design problems consist of sets of constraints that must be satisfied simultaneously—the challenge isn't just meeting individual constraints but resolving conflicts between them. His concept of "goodness of fit" describes designs where form successfully satisfies contextual constraints, while "misfits" reveal where constraints clash or remain unsatisfied.

The Constraint Audit operationalizes Alexander's framework. Students identify constraints operating in their chosen text/process/system, examine how these constraints shape choices, and look for misfits where constraints conflict. This analytical approach reveals that constraint isn't just restriction—it's the material condition that generates design problems and their solutions. A writer facing a 500-word limit doesn't just have "less space to write"; they have a fundamentally different compositional problem than a writer with 2000 words. The constraint shapes what's possible.

Alexander's later work (*The Timeless Way of Building*, 1979) on "pattern languages" also informs the Spec Document. Pattern languages codify successful solutions to recurring design problems, creating shared vocabulary for discussing design choices. Spec documents function similarly: they create shared vocabulary (requirements, constraints, success criteria, milestones) for discussing projects, enabling collaboration by making tacit knowledge explicit.

**Donald Schön's work on reflection-in-action** (*The Reflective Practitioner*, 1983) explains why spec documents matter pedagogically. Schön argues that expert practitioners don't just reflect *after* completing work—they reflect *during* the process, continually reassessing their understanding and adjusting their approach. Spec documents create occasions for reflection-in-action: by articulating intentions and requirements before beginning, students create a reference point for assessing whether their work is going as planned. When circumstances change, updating the spec becomes an act of reflective practice—documenting how understanding evolved.

Schön also emphasizes that professional practice involves "problem framing"—deciding which aspects of a complex situation to attend to and how to define success. Spec documents require problem framing: students must decide what their project is, why it matters, what success looks like. This meta-level work is difficult but essential—it's not execution skill but strategic thinking about what to execute and why.

**Donella Meadows [[@meadows2008lever]]' systems thinking** (*Thinking in Systems*, 2008) supports the Constraint Audit's analytical approach. Meadows argues that system behavior emerges from interactions among elements, feedback loops, and stocks/flows—not from individual components in isolation. Constraint audits apply this systems perspective: rather than analyzing texts as collections of rhetorical moves, students examine how constraints interact to shape what the text can do and be. This systems view reveals that changing one constraint often affects others—solving a length constraint by cutting sections might create coherence problems; satisfying audience expectations might conflict with the writer's authentic voice.

### Composition Pedagogy

**Mariolina Salvatori's [[@salvatori1996conve]] difficulty-as-diagnostic methodology** ("Conversations with Texts: Reading in the Teaching of Composition," 1996) informs both assignments. Salvatori argues that difficulty in reading signals something worth investigating—not a failure to understand but an opportunity for analytical work. The Constraint Audit extends this principle: when something doesn't work well (a misfit, in Alexander's terms), that difficulty is informational. It reveals constraint conflicts or design choices that didn't successfully satisfy competing demands. Students learn to treat friction as data rather than just frustration.

The Spec Document also implements difficulty-as-diagnostic by making planning visible. When students struggle to articulate requirements or success criteria, that struggle reveals something important: maybe the project isn't well-defined yet, or competing goals need resolution, or implicit assumptions need examination. This productive difficulty is part of the assignment's pedagogical value—it surfaces thinking that often remains invisible in traditional "just start writing" approaches.

**Fred Brooks [[@brooks1986silve]]' work on design complexity** (*The Mythical Man-Month*, 1975; *The Design of Design*, 2010) explains why both assignments emphasize constraints explicitly. Brooks argues that complexity in design emerges not from individual components but from their interactions and interdependencies. Both spec documents and constraint audits make these interdependencies visible: specs articulate how requirements relate to constraints and stakeholder needs; audits examine how constraints interact to enable or restrict possibilities. This explicit examination of relationships prepares students for complex composition tasks where multiple constraints must be satisfied simultaneously.

## Implementation Approach

### Spec Document as Documentation Genre

The Spec Document introduces students to process documentation as a compositional genre distinct from reflection. Key differences:

**Timing**: Documentation happens prospectively and concurrently (planning what will happen, tracking what is happening), not just retrospectively (reflecting on what happened). Spec documents are written *before* projects begin and updated during execution.

**Purpose**: Documentation creates shared understanding and actionable guidance, not just personal insight. A good spec helps collaborators understand the project, helps the writer stay on track, and provides a reference point for assessing progress.

**Conventions**: Documentation genres have specific conventions (README files, specifications, development logs) that students can learn and adapt. This genre knowledge transfers—students who learn to write clear specs can apply those skills to project proposals, grant applications, business plans, research proposals.

The requirement to "write a spec for a project you're actually planning" ensures documentation serves genuine purposes rather than being a hypothetical exercise. Students who spec their English 101 portfolio, a music recording project, a job search, or an organizing initiative have reasons to care about clarity and specificity that don't exist with invented examples.

### Constraint Audit as Analytical Framework

The Constraint Audit replaces traditional rhetorical analysis in Movement 2 for several reasons:

**Conceptual continuity**: Analyzing constraints connects directly to course themes (constraint literacy, design thinking, systems) in ways that pure rhetorical analysis might not.

**Broader applicability**: Students can audit constraints in any designed object—texts, processes, systems, interfaces, organizational structures. This flexibility lets them choose analysis subjects they find genuinely interesting rather than being limited to traditional rhetorical texts.

**Evaluative dimension**: Asking "are these constraints productive or problematic?" requires evaluation beyond description. Students must assess whether constraints enable good outcomes (goodness of fit) or create unnecessary problems (misfits). This evaluative work develops critical thinking more than purely descriptive analysis.

**Connection to production**: Because students just completed Spec Documents (articulating constraints they'll work within), they have experiential foundation for understanding how constraints function. The audit builds on this experience by examining how others navigated constraints.

The flexible subject matter (text, process, or system) also accommodates student expertise. A student deeply engaged with video game design can audit game mechanics. A student working in restaurant kitchens can audit workflow constraints. A student learning a language can audit pedagogical material. This flexibility honors Alexander's insight that design problems appear everywhere, not just in traditionally "academic" contexts.

### Separated Peer Review with Different Protocols

Reviewing Spec Documents in Week 6 with generous protocol (SPQ: Sayback-Pointing-Questioning) recognizes that specs are explanatory and planning documents. Writers need to know:
- What came through clearly (sayback)
- What parts were particularly effective or noticeable (pointing)
- What questions remain or what needs clarification (questioning)

This reader response helps writers revise for clarity and completeness without requiring evaluative judgment about whether the project itself is "good"—that's the writer's decision, not the reviewer's.

Reviewing Constraint Audits in Week 7 with evaluative protocol (DES: Describe-Evaluate-Suggest [[@elireview2025givi]]) recognizes that audits are analytical arguments requiring criteria-based assessment. Reviewers need to evaluate:
- Whether the analysis is systematic and thorough
- Whether claims are supported with specific evidence
- Whether the audit identifies genuine constraints vs. superficial limitations
- Whether the evaluative dimension (productive vs. problematic) is well-reasoned

This protocol shift also teaches students that different writing tasks need different kinds of feedback—a lesson in rhetorical awareness and constraint literacy. The generous protocol wouldn't provide useful feedback for analytical writing; the evaluative protocol would be too harsh for planning documents.

## Competing Values & Tradeoffs

### Combined Assignment vs. Two Separate Assignments

**Tension**: Combining Spec Document + Constraint Audit into one 50-point milestone creates a more complex assignment structure than traditional single-assignment milestones. Does this complexity serve learning or just add confusion?

**Resolution**: The combination creates pedagogical value that separate assignments wouldn't achieve:

1. **Conceptual pairing**: Experiencing constraints from both production side (articulating constraints in specs) and analytical side (examining constraints in audits) creates richer understanding than either alone.

2. **Practical balance**: The 25+25 point split means neither component is overwhelming, but together they constitute a substantial Movement 2 milestone comparable to traditional major assignments.

3. **Separated peer review**: Students get focused feedback on each component using appropriate protocols, preventing review overload while ensuring both pieces get attention.

The integration is conceptual (both address constraints) rather than mechanical (one doesn't literally build on the other), which maintains clarity about what each assignment requires while establishing thematic coherence across Movement 2.

### Spec Documents for Real vs. Hypothetical Projects

**Tension**: Requiring students to spec "projects they're actually planning" creates authenticity but also variability—some students have well-defined projects; others don't. Should the assignment allow hypothetical projects to ensure everyone has viable subject matter?

**Resolution**: Authentic projects serve pedagogy better than hypothetical ones for several reasons:

1. **Motivation**: Students care more about planning real work than inventing plausible-sounding projects
2. **Stakes**: Real projects create genuine need for clarity—vague specs have actual consequences
3. **Revision utility**: Students can actually use their specs to guide their real projects, making the assignment valuable beyond just grade-getting

For students who don't have current projects, the framing "something you plan to undertake" allows flexibility in timeline—projects that might begin in future months still count as "planned." Many students spec their English 101 portfolio work, which ensures they have authentic subject matter even if they lack external projects. The preparatory fragment (brainstorming) in Week 5 also helps students identify viable projects before drafting.

### Constraint Audit vs. Traditional Rhetorical Analysis

**Tension**: Rhetorical analysis is standard composition curriculum with decades of pedagogical research supporting it. Does replacing it with constraint audit sacrifice proven practice for untested innovation?

**Resolution**: Constraint audit supplements rather than entirely replaces rhetorical analysis—students still examine audience, purpose, and genre (all of which function as constraints). The innovation is framing these elements through constraint lens rather than (or in addition to) appeals lens. This reframing serves course themes without abandoning analytical rigor.

Additionally, rhetorical analysis sometimes reinforces narrow views of writing as primarily persuasive. Constraint auditing works equally well for persuasive, informative, expressive, and exploratory writing, and extends naturally to non-textual designed objects (systems, processes, interfaces). This broader applicability better serves students who'll encounter diverse writing tasks beyond persuasive academic essays.

## Evidence & Iteration

### Evidence to Collect

- [ ] **Project diversity**: What kinds of projects do students spec? Are choices authentic (actually planned) or compliance-driven (invented to satisfy assignment)?
- [ ] **Spec clarity**: Do specs provide actionable guidance, or remain vague despite requirements for specificity?
- [ ] **Constraint audit depth**: Do audits identify genuine constraint interactions and misfits, or just list obvious limitations?
- [ ] **Analytical sophistication**: Do audits move beyond description to evaluation (productive vs. problematic constraints)?
- [ ] **Reading integration**: Do audits reference Alexander, Meadows, and other M2 readings appropriately?
- [ ] **Peer review effectiveness**: Does generous protocol (Week 6) help specs improve clarity? Does evaluative protocol (Week 7) strengthen analytical claims in audits?
- [ ] **Student reflections**: M2 reflections and conference discussions may reveal whether students found the combined assignment coherent or confusing.

### Revision Notes

**First-pilot questions**:
- Is the 600-900 word range appropriate for specs, or should it be shorter (more concise) or longer (more detailed)?
- Is the 800-1200 word range appropriate for audits, or should it match rhetorical analysis conventions (typically 1000-1500)?
- Do students understand how specs and audits relate conceptually, or see them as arbitrary pairing?
- Is Week 8 final submission (after both components are reviewed) feasible given peer review timelines?
- Would students benefit from seeing example specs and audits before drafting, or is the README reading sufficient modeling?
- Does Alexander's framework (goodness of fit, misfits) provide useful analytical tools, or do students find it confusing?
