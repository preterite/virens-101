## Overview

The System Map is a visual diagram with explanatory annotations that documents your personal workflow infrastructure—the tools, technologies, information flows, decision points, and processes that characterized your composing work this semester. Unlike Process Archaeology (which analyzes patterns in your practice), the System Map visualizes the infrastructure within which that practice happened: What tools did you use? How did information flow between them? Where were decision points? What bottlenecks or pain points appeared? What worked well versus what created friction?

This portfolio component demonstrates [[outcome-workflow-technologies|workflow technologies]] and [[outcome-process-documentation|process documentation]], showing your ability to make infrastructure visible and analyze it systematically. The map itself is visual (diagram, flowchart, network visualization), but you'll also provide 400-600 words of annotations explaining key elements and what they reveal about your composing system.

---

## Context

Most writers use multiple tools and technologies in their work—physical materials (notebooks, index cards, printed drafts), digital tools (word processors, cloud storage, citation managers), communication platforms (email, messaging apps, LMS), and organizational systems (folders, filing systems, naming conventions). These tools constitute infrastructure: the largely invisible systems that make work possible.

Infrastructure tends to be invisible until it breaks. You don't think about your folder organization system until you can't find a file. You don't notice your backup strategy until you lose work. You don't recognize your decision-making points until you're stuck deciding where something goes. The System Map makes this infrastructure visible, creating opportunity to examine what's working well, what's creating problems, and what might be optimized.

The map draws on concepts from Susan Leigh Star and Geoffrey Bowker (Week 11 reading on infrastructure invisibility) and Don Norman (Week 13 reading on design thinking). Star and Bowker argue that infrastructure becomes visible at breakdown points—when things stop working, we suddenly notice the systems we depend on. Norman emphasizes that well-designed systems provide clear signifiers, appropriate constraints, and useful feedback. Your System Map can examine both: Where did breakdowns make infrastructure visible? How did your systems provide (or fail to provide) good signifiers, constraints, and feedback?

The assignment complements other portfolio components: Process Archaeology analyzes what you did, System Map visualizes the infrastructure that enabled (or hindered) what you did, Documented Inquiry and Transfer Proposal represent the work that infrastructure supported.

## Task

Create a visual system map (diagram, flowchart, network visualization) that documents your composing infrastructure, including tools and technologies used, information flows between components, decision points where you made choices, bottlenecks or pain points that created difficulty, and connections to course technologies (index cards, OneDrive/Word, Zotero, Eli Review, Canvas), accompanied by 400-600 words of annotations that explain key elements and analyze what the map reveals about your workflow system.

---

## Standards

This assignment demonstrates your developing abilities across multiple course outcomes:

1. **[[outcome-workflow-technologies|Workflow Technologies & Collaboration]]**: The map documents your actual technology use across the semester, showing which tools served which purposes
2. **[[outcome-process-documentation|Process Documentation & Metacognition]]**: Visualizing infrastructure is sophisticated documentation practice—making visible what's normally invisible
3. **[[outcome-constraint-literacy|Constraint Literacy]]**: Analyzing bottlenecks and pain points shows understanding of constraints not just in texts but in workflows themselves
4. **Visual clarity**: The map is readable and organized—viewers can follow information flows and understand system structure
5. **Completeness**: The map includes major tools, flows, and decision points—not just obvious elements but also informal or improvised parts of your system
6. **Accuracy**: The map represents your actual infrastructure, not an idealized version—honest documentation of what you really used
7. **Analytical annotations**: Written explanation analyzes what the map reveals (patterns, bottlenecks, surprises) rather than just describing what's shown
8. **Infrastructure concepts**: Annotations reference Star & Bowker's infrastructure invisibility and/or Norman's design concepts where relevant

Assessment:
- As portfolio component, assessed through portfolio rubric examining visualization quality, completeness, and analytical depth
- No separate peer review (visual work doesn't fit standard peer review protocols well)

See [[grading-assessment-content-v101|Grading & Assessment]] for portfolio assessment details.

## Guidance

**Document your actual system, not an ideal one**. The most valuable System Maps show what you really did—including improvised solutions, workarounds, and things that didn't work well. A messy but honest map teaches you more than a neat but fictional one.

**Include both physical and digital components**. Your system probably involved:
- Physical: index cards, printed drafts, handwritten notes, sticky notes, notebook pages
- Digital: Word/Google Docs, OneDrive folders, Zotero library, Eli Review, Canvas, email, phone notes
- Connections: how physical materials became digital, how digital files were organized, how information flowed between platforms

Show these connections explicitly—they're where infrastructure becomes interesting.

**Mark decision points clearly**. Where did you make choices in your workflow? Examples:
- "Do I save this as a fragment or development log entry?"
- "Does this source go in my Zotero library or just get bookmarked?"
- "Should I print this draft for review or work on screen?"

These decision points reveal your workflow logic. If you have many decision points, your system might be complex. If you have few, your system might be automated (good) or inflexible (problematic).

**Identify bottlenecks and pain points**. Where did your system create friction? Examples:
- Files lost because folder structure was unclear
- Time wasted transferring information between incompatible tools
- Difficulty finding specific fragments because organization system was inadequate
- Confusion about which version was current

Honest acknowledgment of problems makes the map more valuable than pretending everything worked perfectly.

**Show what worked well too**. Infrastructure analysis shouldn't be only about problems. What parts of your system were reliable, efficient, or elegant? Maybe your naming convention made files easy to find. Maybe your habit of backing up to multiple locations prevented data loss. Maybe your use of Zotero saved time on citation formatting. Recognize successes.

**Reference course technologies** but don't limit yourself to them. The course required index cards, OneDrive/Word, Zotero, Eli Review, and Canvas. Show how you used these. But also include any other tools: personal notebooks, sticky notes, phone apps, browser bookmarks, messaging apps for discussing work with friends, whatever actually constituted your infrastructure.

**Choose a visual format that fits your system**. Possible formats:
- **Flowchart**: Shows linear or branching processes with decision points
- **Network diagram**: Shows interconnected tools and information flows
- **Layer diagram**: Shows physical layer, digital layer, and cloud layer with connections between
- **Ecosystem map**: Shows tools as nodes with flows between them

Pick whichever format best represents how your system actually worked.

**Write analytical annotations, not just descriptions**. Compare approaches:

*Descriptive*: "I used index cards for brainstorming and Word for drafting."

*Analytical*: "Index cards afforded spatial manipulation and easy reorganization during brainstorming, but transferring handwritten notes to digital drafts created a bottleneck—I often lost ideas during transcription. A better system might capture ideas digitally initially, though that loses the physical manipulation affordance."

Analysis reveals implications and suggests improvements.
