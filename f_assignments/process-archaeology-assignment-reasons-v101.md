## Design Rationale

Process Archaeology transforms traditional portfolio reflection by requiring evidence-based analysis of accumulated process documentation (development logs, fragments, drafts, feedback, revision plans) using conceptual frameworks (Norman's [[@norman2013desig]] design vocabulary, difficulty-as-diagnostic methodology) to identify patterns in composing practices. Rather than relying on memory and generalization—the weaknesses of typical reflective writing—process archaeology treats students' archived work as data to analyze systematically, producing verifiable claims about how they composed across the semester.

Three pedagogical goals drive this design:

1. **Evidence-based metacognition**: Traditional reflection often produces vague generalizations ("I became a better writer"). Process archaeology requires specific, verifiable claims supported by evidence from archived work, developing more rigorous metacognitive practices.

2. **Conceptual vocabulary application**: Using Norman's design concepts (affordances, constraints, signifiers, feedback) provides students with precise language for describing composing infrastructure and practices, moving beyond everyday language toward analytical frameworks transferable to other contexts.

3. **Process documentation payoff**: Throughout the semester, students maintained development logs and saved versions. Process archaeology demonstrates why that documentation matters—it becomes archaeological evidence rather than bureaucratic requirement.

The assignment completes the course's process documentation arc: students produced documentation (logs, specs) in earlier movements, now they analyze that documentation retrospectively to understand their own practices. This movement from production to analysis demonstrates sophisticated metacognitive work appropriate for portfolio assessment.

## Theoretical Grounding

### Reflection & Metacognition

**Kathleen Blake Yancey's [[@yancey1998refle]] work on reflection in writing** (*Reflection in the Writing Classroom*, 1998; *Teaching Literature as Reflective Practice*, 2004) establishes foundational principles for portfolio reflection. Yancey argues that effective reflection requires three elements: (1) retrospection (looking back), (2) connection (linking past experiences to current understanding), and (3) projection (considering implications for future practice). Process archaeology implements all three: students look back at their documented work, connect patterns they discover to their current understanding of composing processes, and project forward about practices to maintain or change.

Yancey also emphasizes that reflection shouldn't be purely celebratory—it must acknowledge difficulty, failure, and uncertainty as sites for learning. Process archaeology operationalizes this principle through difficulty-as-diagnostic framework: students examine where they struggled, what that difficulty revealed, and how they responded. This honest assessment produces more valuable insights than self-congratulatory reflection.

**Nancy Sommers' longitudinal research on student writers** ("Across the Drafts," 2006; "The Call of Research: A Longitudinal View of Writing Development," 2016) demonstrates that writers develop not through linear improvement but through recursive engagement with increasingly complex challenges. Sommers tracked students across four years and found that "improvement" often looked like increased struggle as students tackled harder writing tasks. Process archaeology helps students recognize this pattern—if later assignments felt harder than early ones, that difficulty might signal growth toward complexity rather than regression.

Sommers also emphasizes that writers need metalanguage for describing their practices. Without vocabulary for articulating what they do when they write, students can't transfer practices across contexts because they can't name what's transferable. Norman's design vocabulary provides this metalanguage—students can describe their composing infrastructure using precise concepts (affordances, constraints) rather than vague terms like "it was hard" or "it worked well."

### Design Thinking

**Don Norman's design vocabulary** (*The Design of Everyday Things*, multiple editions) provides the conceptual framework students apply in process archaeology. Norman's concepts describe how designed objects and systems shape user behavior:

- **Affordances**: Properties that determine what actions are possible (a door handle affords pulling or pushing)
- **Constraints**: Limitations that shape how objects can be used (a USB cable constrains directionality)
- **Signifiers**: Indicators of how something works (a "push" sign signifies door operation)
- **Feedback**: Information about the result of an action (a click sound confirms a button press)

These concepts transfer beautifully to analyzing composing processes. Writing tools and workflows have affordances (index cards afford spatial manipulation, digital documents afford easy revision), constraints (word limits, deadlines, genre conventions), signifiers (assignment criteria indicate what counts as "good"), and feedback (peer reviews, instructor comments, grades). By applying Norman's framework, students can analyze their composing infrastructure systematically rather than just reporting what happened.

**Donald Schön's reflection-in-action** (*The Reflective Practitioner*, 1983) distinguishes between reflection-in-action (thinking while doing) and reflection-on-action (thinking afterward). Process archaeology is sophisticated reflection-on-action: students examine their documented practices retrospectively to understand patterns not visible during the actual composing. This retrospective analysis can inform future reflection-in-action—once students recognize patterns (like writing more effectively in morning blocks or needing warm-up time), they can adjust their practices prospectively.

### Transfer Theory

**Anne Beaufort's [[@beaufort2007colle]] framework for teaching transfer** (*College Writing and Beyond*, 2007) emphasizes that transfer requires both varied practice and metacognitive awareness. Process archaeology builds metacognitive awareness by asking students to identify patterns across varied writing tasks—what practices remained consistent, what changed based on genre or purpose, what strategies worked across contexts. This pattern recognition supports transfer: students can recognize which practices are situation-specific versus which are portable.

## Implementation Approach

### Evidence-Based Analysis

The requirement to support claims with specific evidence from archived work distinguishes process archaeology from impressionistic reflection. Students must quote from their development logs, reference specific peer review comments, cite fragment dates, point to revision patterns. This evidence requirement creates verifiable claims:

*Impressionistic*: "I improved at using sources."
*Evidence-based*: "Peer review feedback from Cycles 1-3 consistently noted that I summarized sources rather than analyzing them, but Cycles 4-6 show fewer summary criticisms and more requests to extend my analysis, suggesting I developed source integration skills across Movement 3."

The evidence-based approach also prevents false memory—students can't claim they "always" did something when their logs show otherwise, and they might discover productive patterns they didn't consciously recognize during the semester.

### Norman Vocabulary as Analytical Tool

Requiring Norman's concepts (affordances, constraints, signifiers, feedback) provides structure for analysis while developing transferable metalanguage. Without this vocabulary requirement, students might produce purely narrative accounts ("In Week 1 I did X, in Week 2 I did Y"). Norman's framework encourages analytical categorization: What affordances did my tools provide? What constraints shaped my choices? What signified "good writing" in different contexts? What feedback mechanisms informed my revisions?

This vocabulary also prepares students for the System Map assignment, where they'll visualize their workflow infrastructure using similar design concepts. The two assignments work together—process archaeology analyzes what happened; system map visualizes the infrastructure that made it happen.

### No Peer Review by Design

Unlike most major assignments, Process Archaeology doesn't receive peer review. This design choice reflects two considerations:

1. **Privacy**: Process archaeology analyzes students' own practices, including struggles and failures. Peer review might inhibit honest analysis if students worry about appearing incompetent to classmates.

2. **Evidence access**: Meaningful peer review would require reviewers to examine the writer's archived work (logs, fragments, feedback)—a substantial burden. Without that evidence, reviewers can only comment on whether the archaeology sounds convincing, not whether it's accurate.

The process prep fragment (Week 13) provides opportunity for early thinking without full peer review exposure. Students can gather evidence, identify preliminary patterns, and develop drafts without sharing vulnerable analysis with peers.

## Competing Values & Tradeoffs

### Evidence Burden vs. Reflection Authenticity

**Tension**: Requiring evidence might make process archaeology feel mechanical—students gathering quotations to support claims rather than genuinely reflecting on experience.

**Resolution**: The evidence requirement prevents the opposite problem—reflection becoming impressionistic storytelling disconnected from what actually happened. The evidence grounds analysis in reality. Students who engage seriously find that examining their archived work surfaces patterns they hadn't consciously recognized, making archaeology genuinely revelatory rather than just confirmatory.

### Norman Vocabulary: Tool vs. Constraint

**Tension**: Requiring specific vocabulary might feel artificial—students forced to use concepts that don't fit their experience.

**Resolution**: Norman's concepts are broadly applicable to any designed system or process, including composing. The requirement ensures students develop metalanguage for describing practices rather than relying on vague everyday language. Students who initially resist the vocabulary requirement often discover it helps them see their practices more clearly—the concepts provide analytical purchase that everyday language doesn't offer.

The vocabulary also demonstrates a course principle: conceptual frameworks from outside composition (here, design theory) can illuminate writing practices in productive ways. This cross-disciplinary thinking models intellectual work beyond English class.

## Evidence & Iteration

### Evidence to Collect

- [ ] **Pattern identification quality**: Do students identify genuine patterns across time, or just report individual instances?
- [ ] **Evidence use**: Are claims supported with specific evidence (quoted logs, cited dates, referenced feedback), or just asserted?
- [ ] **Norman vocabulary accuracy**: Do students apply affordances/constraints/signifiers/feedback accurately, or misuse terms?
- [ ] **Difficulty engagement**: Do students analyze moments of struggle productively, or avoid acknowledging difficulty?
- [ ] **Actionable insights**: Do conclusions suggest specific implications for future practice, or remain vague?
- [ ] **Honesty**: Do archaeologies acknowledge both productive and problematic patterns, or only celebrate successes?

### Revision Notes

**First-pilot questions**:
- Is 1200-1800 words appropriate length for pattern analysis with evidence, or should it be longer?
- Do students have sufficient archived material to conduct archaeology, or should more documentation be required earlier?
- Is Norman's vocabulary accessible enough after one reading (Week 13), or does it need earlier introduction?
- Would students benefit from seeing example process archaeologies before writing their own?
- Does process archaeology feel like genuine metacognitive work, or like mechanical evidence collection?
