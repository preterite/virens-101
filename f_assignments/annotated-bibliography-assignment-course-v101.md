## Overview

The Annotated Bibliography is Movement 3's milestone assignment, worth 50 points and due Week 11. This assignment asks you to create a structured collection of source entries that goes beyond traditional annotated bibliographies by incorporating BEAM framework analysis (Background, Exhibit, Argument, Method), examining source genealogy (how sources lead to other sources), and providing framing components (introduction, synthesis, research questions) that contextualize your source collection as a curated resource rather than just a list.

The assignment has three preparatory fragments (BEAM source entry #1, BEAM source entry #2, portfolio framing) and receives peer review in two cycles (Week 8 for individual entries, Week 10 for framing components). This iterative development demonstrates [[outcome-textual-accumulation|textual accumulation]]—you build the bibliography progressively rather than assembling it all at once at the end.

## Context

Traditional annotated bibliographies in composition courses ask students to list sources with brief summaries and evaluations. This assignment extends that foundation by asking you to analyze *how* you're using sources (BEAM framework), trace *where* sources came from (genealogy), and explain *why* this particular collection of sources matters (framing). These additions transform the bibliography from a compliance exercise into a genuine research tool—something you could actually use to understand a topic or share with others who need orientation to relevant scholarship.

The BEAM framework—developed by Joseph Bizup—categorizes sources by rhetorical use rather than just type. A source might be Background (providing context), Exhibit (offering data or examples to analyze), Argument (making claims to agree with or argue against), or Method (demonstrating approaches or frameworks). This functional analysis helps you see that the same source might serve different purposes in different projects, and that source diversity isn't just about having different kinds of sources (books, articles, websites) but about using sources in different ways.

Source genealogy—tracing how you found sources through citations, recommendations, database searches, or serendipity—makes visible the research pathway that's often invisible in final papers. This documentation serves [[outcome-process-documentation|process documentation]] goals and helps you (and others) understand how knowledge networks actually work rather than pretending research is a straightforward path from question to answer.

The assignment prepares you for the Documented Inquiry in Movement 4, where you'll draw on this source collection to compose a researched piece. Having already analyzed sources through BEAM and traced their relationships, you'll be ready to integrate sources purposefully rather than just plugging in quotations to meet citation requirements.

## Task

Create an annotated bibliography of 8-12 sources that includes: (1) a framing introduction (200-300 words) explaining your research focus and why these sources matter, (2) individual BEAM-tagged source entries (150-200 words each) that summarize, analyze rhetorical use, and trace source genealogy, (3) a synthesis section (200-300 words) identifying patterns, gaps, or conflicts across sources, and (4) 2-3 research questions that emerge from your engagement with these sources and could guide future inquiry.

## Standards

This assignment demonstrates your developing abilities across multiple course outcomes:

1. **[[outcome-rhetorical-awareness|Rhetorical Awareness]]**: BEAM tagging requires recognizing how sources function rhetorically—not just what they say but how you're using them in your thinking
2. **[[outcome-critical-thinking|Critical Thinking & Difficulty-as-Diagnostic]]**: Identifying patterns, gaps, and conflicts across sources requires analytical comparison rather than just summarizing each source independently
3. **[[outcome-workflow-technologies|Workflow Technologies & Collaboration]]**: Managing 8-12 sources, tracking citations, organizing entries, and maintaining consistency demonstrates research workflow practices
4. **[[outcome-textual-accumulation|Textual Accumulation]]**: The bibliography builds on preparatory fragments and becomes material for future research writing (Documented Inquiry)
5. **Complete citations**: Each source includes full bibliographic citation in MLA format (or another approved citation style if you're using discipline-specific sources)
6. **BEAM analysis accuracy**: Tags appropriately identify whether you're using sources as Background, Exhibit, Argument, or Method—and a single source may have multiple tags if used multiple ways
7. **Source genealogy documentation**: Entries explain how you found the source, creating transparency about research pathways
8. **Synthesis quality**: Your synthesis identifies meaningful patterns (sources cluster around certain themes, approaches differ by discipline, newer sources complicate older assumptions) rather than just restating that sources exist
9. **Research questions**: Questions are specific enough to guide inquiry but open enough to allow investigation—not just yes/no questions or questions already answered by your sources

Assessment:
- **Individual source entries** (8-12 entries, 150-200 words each with BEAM tags and genealogy): 30 points
- **Framing introduction**: 5 points
- **Synthesis section**: 10 points
- **Research questions**: 5 points
- **Total**: 50 points

This assignment receives formal peer review in two cycles:
- Week 8 (Cycle 4): Individual source entries (evaluative protocol)
- Week 10 (Cycle 5): Framing components (generous protocol)

## Guidance

**Choose a focused research area that interests you**. You'll work with these sources for several weeks and draw on them for Documented Inquiry. Pick a topic you genuinely want to understand better, not just something that seems "academic." Your curiosity makes better research than compliance.

**Start with 5-6 sources and expand to 8-12**. Don't try to find all sources at once. Begin with a few key sources that seem central to your topic, analyze them using BEAM, see what they cite or what they suggest is important, and let your collection grow organically. This approach demonstrates how real research works—following leads rather than just filling slots.

**Use BEAM tags honestly and specifically**. Don't just tag everything as "Background" because it provides context. Think carefully: Am I using this source to establish what's generally known (Background)? To provide examples or data I'll analyze (Exhibit)? To engage with claims I agree or disagree with (Argument)? To adopt a framework or methodology (Method)? Multiple tags are fine if you're using a source in multiple ways.

**Document source genealogy completely**. For each source, note: How did you find it? Did it come from another source's citations? From a database search using specific keywords? From an instructor or librarian recommendation? From browsing a journal issue? This documentation might feel unnecessary now, but it's incredibly useful when you need to find similar sources later or explain your research process in Process Archaeology.

**Write synthesis, don't just summarize**. The synthesis section shouldn't say "Source A discusses X, Source B discusses Y, Source C discusses Z." It should identify relationships: "Three sources (A, B, C) all address X but from different disciplinary perspectives—sociology, economics, and public health. These different perspectives lead to conflicting recommendations about policy approaches." Synthesis reveals patterns you couldn't see by reading sources one at a time.

**Let research questions emerge from sources, not just your initial curiosity**. Before reading sources, you might have wondered "How does social media affect teen mental health?" After reading sources, you might realize that question is too broad and the more interesting question is "Why do longitudinal studies and cross-sectional studies reach different conclusions about social media effects?" Let your sources complicate and refine your thinking.

**Use Zotero or another citation manager if possible**. This assignment requires accurate MLA citations for 8-12 sources. Citation managers handle formatting automatically and make it easy to reorganize entries or switch citation styles. If you haven't used a citation manager before, this is a good opportunity to learn—the library offers Zotero workshops.

**Build on your preparatory fragments**. You've already written BEAM entries for 2+ sources in Week 8. Use those as foundation and extend the collection rather than starting fresh. The portfolio framing fragment from Week 10 becomes your introduction and synthesis with additional development.
