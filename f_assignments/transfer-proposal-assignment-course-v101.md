## Overview

The Transfer Proposal is the final piece of writing you'll complete in English 101, due on the last day of the semester (Week 15, Block 6). This brief document (600-900 words) articulates what practices, concepts, or understandings from this course you expect to transfer to future writing contexts—other courses, workplace writing, personal projects, civic participation. Unlike traditional reflection that looks backward ("what did I learn?"), transfer thinking looks forward ("what matters beyond this course?") while grounding projections in evidence from your portfolio work.

This assignment demonstrates all seven course outcomes by asking you to identify which outcomes matter most for your future work and explain how the practices or concepts you've developed will apply in new contexts. It serves as portfolio conclusion and as metacognitive document that can guide your future writing across settings.

## Context

Transfer is one of the most important—and most difficult—goals in education. Many students learn skills or concepts in one class but don't recognize opportunities to use them elsewhere. Traditional composition courses often treat transfer implicitly: "You'll use these skills in other courses" without examining what skills, which courses, or how the skills might adapt. Transfer research (Beaufort [[@beaufort2007colle]], Yancey [[@yancey1998refle]], Wardle [[@downs2007teaci]], Robertson) shows that transfer doesn't happen automatically—it requires metacognitive awareness of what's been learned, understanding of how contexts differ, and deliberate application of knowledge to new situations.

The Transfer Proposal makes transfer explicit and strategic. Rather than vaguely hoping that "writing skills" transfer, you identify specific practices (maintaining process documentation, using BEAM to analyze source function, applying constraint sequencing principles) and specific future contexts (biology lab reports, business communication, creative projects, civic writing). You also think about how practices might need adaptation—what works for English 101 might need modification for other genres, audiences, or purposes.

The proposal draws on all your portfolio work as evidence. When you claim that "managing textual accumulation" transfers to other contexts, you can point to your corpus of 40+ fragments and explain how that practice might adapt to maintaining research notes in biology or compiling materials for a graphic design portfolio. Evidence grounds your projections, preventing transfer thinking from becoming wishful thinking.

The assignment's placement on the final day of the semester is purposeful—it's not reflective busywork but genuine forward-thinking work that completes the portfolio and prepares you for writing beyond English 101.

## Task

Write a transfer proposal of 600-900 words that identifies 3-5 specific practices, concepts, or understandings from English 101 that you expect to use in future writing contexts, explains what those future contexts are (specific courses, workplace settings, personal projects, civic participation), describes how each practice or concept will adapt to new contexts (not just directly replicate), provides evidence from your portfolio work demonstrating you've developed these transferable elements, and articulates why these particular elements matter for your anticipated writing future.

## Standards

This assignment demonstrates your developing abilities across all seven course outcomes by asking you to identify which outcomes and practices transfer:

1. **[[outcome-composing-processes|Composing Processes]]**: You articulate which composing practices you've developed and how they'll apply to future writing
2. **[[outcome-critical-thinking|Critical Thinking]]**: You analyze how practices might need adaptation for new contexts rather than assuming direct transfer
3. **[[outcome-rhetorical-awareness|Rhetorical Awareness]]**: You recognize that different contexts have different conventions, audiences, and purposes requiring adapted approaches
4. **[[outcome-constraint-literacy|Constraint Literacy]]**: You understand that different writing situations involve different constraints requiring strategic navigation
5. **[[outcome-textual-accumulation|Textual Accumulation]]**: You recognize how accumulation practices might apply to building knowledge in other domains
6. **[[outcome-workflow-technologies|Workflow Technologies]]**: You identify which technology practices transfer to other collaborative or documentation contexts
7. **[[outcome-process-documentation|Process Documentation]]**: You articulate how documentation practices support learning and production in various settings
8. **Specificity**: Claims about transfer identify concrete practices and contexts, not vague "writing skills" and "future classes"
9. **Evidence-based**: Projections are grounded in portfolio evidence showing you've actually developed the practices you claim will transfer
10. **Realistic adaptation**: You acknowledge that transfer requires adaptation—practices don't transplant unchanged but evolve for new contexts
11. **Forward-looking**: The proposal genuinely projects toward future work rather than just retrospectively summarizing the semester

Assessment:
- As portfolio component, assessed through portfolio rubric examining metacognitive sophistication, evidence use, and forward-thinking quality
- No separate peer review (timing doesn't allow)

## Guidance

**Be specific about what transfers**. Don't claim "I learned to be a better writer"—that's too vague to be useful. Instead: "I learned to maintain development logs documenting what I did, what happened, and what I learned, which I can apply to tracking progress in my engineering design courses where iterative prototyping requires similar process documentation."

**Name actual future contexts**. Don't just say "other courses." Identify specific courses you'll take (Biology 102, Business Communication 320, History survey courses), workplace contexts you anticipate (internship reports, client communications, grant proposals), personal projects (maintaining a blog, writing creative fiction), or civic writing (letters to representatives, community organizing materials). The more specific you are, the more useful the proposal becomes.

**Think about adaptation, not just replication**. Transfer rarely means doing exactly the same thing in a new context. Consider: What aspects of a practice transfer directly? What needs modification? What additional skills or knowledge might you need? Example: "BEAM framework helps me analyze how sources function, which transfers to analyzing scientific literature in biology—though in biology the 'Method' category becomes especially important for understanding experimental approaches."

**Use portfolio evidence**. When you claim something transfers, point to portfolio work proving you've developed it: "My Documented Inquiry demonstrates dialogic source engagement (examining claims and evidence rather than just summarizing), a practice I can apply when reading primary sources in history courses." Evidence makes your claims credible.

**Consider the full range of outcomes**. Review all seven course outcomes and consider which ones matter most for your future writing. Don't force yourself to address all seven if some aren't relevant, but do consider the full range before selecting 3-5 to emphasize.

**Distinguish between course-specific and transferable elements**. Some things you learned are specific to English 101 and won't transfer—like the particular assignment sequence or the specific readings. Other things transfer broadly—like difficulty-as-diagnostic thinking or constraint sequencing principles. Focus on genuinely transferable elements.

**Think beyond academic writing**. Transfer includes but isn't limited to writing in other college courses. Consider workplace contexts (emails, reports, proposals, presentations), civic contexts (letters, petitions, public comments), creative contexts (personal essays, fiction, poetry), and digital contexts (social media, blogs, online communities). Your writing future extends beyond college.

**Be honest about uncertainty**. You don't need perfect predictions. It's fine to say "I think constraint sequencing might help with X, though I'm not sure exactly how until I encounter that context." This honest uncertainty is more valuable than false confidence.

**Keep it brief but substantive**. 600-900 words means you need to be concise. Focus on 3-5 strong transfer claims rather than trying to cover everything you learned. Depth matters more than breadth.
