## Overview

Throughout the semester, your instructor will release 10-12 writing prompts designed to help you explore course concepts, practice specific writing moves, or generate material for future work. These instructor-prompt fragments are part of your required fragment production—you must complete at least 5-6 of these prompts:

- **At least 1 in Movement 1** (Weeks 1-3)
- **At least 2 in Movement 2** (Weeks 4-7)
- **Remaining 2-3 in Movements 3-4** (Weeks 8-15, your choice)

Once released, prompts remain available through the end of the semester. You choose which prompts to complete and when to complete them (within movement-based requirements), giving you flexibility to match prompts to your interests and needs.

## Why Instructor Prompts?

Instructor-prompt fragments serve several purposes in your corpus-building work:

**Introduce course concepts**: Some prompts help you explore theoretical ideas from readings (constraint, accumulation, systems thinking) through writing rather than just discussion.

**Practice specific moves**: Some prompts focus on developing particular writing skills (evidence use, compression, synthesis, definition) that transfer across contexts.

**Generate connective material**: Some prompts help you recognize patterns across your corpus or develop transitional thinking that connects disparate fragments.

**Provide accessible entry points**: When you're unsure what to write for an open-topic fragment, prompts offer guided alternatives that still count toward your flexible fragment total.

Prompts are designed to be completable in 1-2 writing blocks (![[_def-blocks-per-week]]), producing fragments in the standard ![[_def-fragment-wordcount-range]]. They're not mini-assignments requiring research or extensive preparation—they're focused writing tasks you can complete during class time.

## How Prompts Are Released

Prompts are released progressively throughout the semester using a "low-density" approach:

**Low density means**: Multiple prompts are available at once, but you only need to complete some of them. When 3-4 prompts are available, you might complete just 1. This creates choice without overwhelming you with required work.

**Release timing**: Prompts typically release:
- 2-3 prompts during Movement 1 (complete at least 1)
- 4-5 prompts during Movement 2 (complete at least 2 total across M1+M2)
- 3-4 prompts during Movements 3-4 (complete remaining required prompts)

**Availability window**: Once released, prompts don't expire. A prompt released in Week 2 remains available in Week 10. This flexibility lets you complete prompts when they're most useful for your thinking or when you need a guided option for a writing block.

## Requirements & Tracking

**Minimum requirements**:
- Complete 5-6 instructor-prompt fragments total
- At least 1 completed in Movement 1
- At least 2 completed in Movement 2 (cumulative—includes M1 prompt)
- Remaining 2-3 completed in Movements 3-4

**How this counts toward fragment production**:
- Instructor-prompt fragments are part of your "flexible fragments" total (11-20 flexible across semester)
- After meeting the 5-6 instructor-prompt minimum, remaining flexible blocks can be either additional prompts or open-topic fragments (your choice)

**Tracking your progress**:
- Mark completed prompts in your fragment index or tracking system
- Check Canvas gradebook for generative writing completion marks
- Review your count before end-of-movement reflections to ensure you've met requirements

**What if you complete more than the minimum?**
That's excellent! Additional instructor-prompt fragments demonstrate engagement with course concepts and provide more material for your corpus. There's no penalty for completing 8 or 10 prompts instead of the minimum 5-6.

## Using Prompts Strategically

**Match prompts to your needs**: When choosing which prompts to complete, consider:
- Which prompts connect to your assignment work? (A prompt about evidence might help BEAM annotation thinking)
- Which prompts address concepts you find confusing? (Writing about constraint might clarify readings)
- Which prompts sound interesting? (Genuine curiosity produces better writing than obligation)

**Complete prompts when they're useful**: Don't feel obligated to complete prompts immediately when released. If a Week 2 prompt doesn't interest you then but becomes relevant during Week 5 assignment work, complete it in Week 5. The flexibility is intentional.

**Use prompts to generate assignment material**: Some prompts explicitly generate material for upcoming assignments. Others might unexpectedly provide useful thinking for work you're doing. When you notice connections between a prompt fragment and an assignment, that's accumulation in action.

**Don't treat prompts as tests**: There are no "right answers" to instructor prompts. They're opportunities to explore ideas through writing. If your response takes an unexpected direction, that's fine—productive tangents often lead to interesting thinking.

## Finding Released Prompts

Instructor prompts are posted in two locations:

1. **Canvas Announcements**: When a new prompt releases, an announcement explains the prompt's focus and provides the full prompt text
2. **Fragment Prompt Collection** (Canvas page): All released prompts are collected in a single Canvas page, organized by movement, so you can review available options at any time

During class, your instructor may briefly introduce new prompts, explain their connection to recent readings or discussions, and answer questions about what the prompt is asking for. However, completing prompts is typically out-of-class work during designated writing blocks.

## Example Prompt Types

While specific prompts vary, here are general categories you might encounter:

**Concept exploration**: "Define 'constraint' in your own words, then identify three constraints currently shaping your writing in this course. Explain how each constraint affects what's possible."

**Reading response variation**: "Choose two readings from Movement 2. Identify one concept where they agree and one where they diverge. Explain what the divergence reveals."

**Corpus analysis**: "Review your fragments from Movement 1. Identify a pattern you notice (repeated topics, writing moves, difficulty points). Analyze what this pattern suggests about your composing processes."

**Constraint experiment**: "Write a 300-word explanation of something complex. Then compress it to 100 words. Reflect on what the constraint forced you to prioritize."

**Transfer thinking**: "Identify a writing move you've practiced in English 101 (using evidence, structuring arguments, revising for clarity). Describe a future context where this move would be useful."

Actual prompts will be more specific than these examples, providing concrete guidance while leaving room for your individual thinking.

## Assessment Integration

Instructor-prompt fragments are assessed through three mechanisms:

**Participation (100 points)**: Writing during designated fragment blocks—including prompt completion—counts toward participation. If you're using class time productively for writing, you're participating.

**Generative writing checks (100 points)**: Your 14 generative writing checks across the semester verify that fragments exist and meet minimum standards (word count, claim with evidence). Instructor-prompt fragments count toward these checks like any other fragment type.

**Portfolio (450 points)**: Instructor-prompt fragments become part of your corpus available for portfolio selection. Some students find that prompt-generated fragments become especially valuable portfolio material because prompts often address metacognitive or conceptual work that strengthens reflective writing.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What if I complete only 4 prompts instead of 5-6?**
A: You'll have completed fewer flexible fragments than required, which affects your generative writing checks and participation scores. Aim for at least 5-6 to meet expectations; completing 6-7 provides cushion.

**Q: Can I complete more than 2 prompts in Movement 1?**
A: Yes! Requirements are minimums, not maximums. If multiple M1 prompts interest you, complete them. They'll count toward your M2 requirement (need 2 total by end of M2) and your overall 5-6 minimum.

**Q: What if I don't find any prompts interesting?**
A: With 10-12 prompts released across the semester, there's likely at least 5-6 that connect to your interests or needs. However, if you genuinely find prompts unhelpful, you can complete more open-topic fragments instead—the minimum requirement is 5-6 prompts, but your total flexible fragment count (11-20) accommodates choice.

**Q: Do instructor-prompt fragments need citations like reading-anchored fragments?**
A: Only if the prompt explicitly asks you to engage with readings. Many prompts ask for your own thinking, observations about your writing, or analysis of your corpus—these don't require citations. When prompts do reference course readings, cite them appropriately.

**Q: Can I use the same prompt twice?**
A: Each prompt should only be completed once. If you want to revisit a prompt's topic, write an open-topic fragment building on your earlier thinking rather than repeating the prompt.
