## Design Rationale

The System Map asks students to visualize their composing infrastructure—tools, information flows, decision points, bottlenecks—using visual representation plus analytical annotations (400-600 words). This assignment makes visible what Susan Leigh Star [[@star1999ethnp]] calls "infrastructural inversion": bringing to consciousness the normally invisible systems that enable work. Unlike Process Archaeology (which analyzes practice patterns) or Transfer Proposal (which projects forward), System Map focuses on infrastructure itself—the designed environment within which composing happened.

Two pedagogical goals drive this design:

1. **Infrastructure visibility**: Students rarely examine their workflow systems explicitly. Mapping infrastructure creates metacognitive awareness of technology choices, organization strategies, and information management practices that shape but don't determine their work.

2. **Visual-analytical synthesis**: Combining visual representation with written analysis develops multimodal communication skills—the map shows system structure while annotations provide analytical insight about patterns, problems, and possibilities.

The assignment connects to course readings (Star & Bowker on infrastructure, Norman [[@norman2013desig]] on design) while complementing other portfolio components: Process Archaeology answers "what did I do?", System Map answers "what infrastructure enabled it?", together they provide comprehensive documentation of composing work.

## Theoretical Grounding

**Susan Leigh Star and Geoffrey Bowker's work on infrastructure** ("Sorting Things Out: Classification and Its Consequences," 1999) establishes that infrastructure is normally invisible—we notice systems only when they break down. Star's concept of "infrastructural inversion" describes making visible what's usually transparent, examining the assumptions, standards, and organization embedded in our tools and workflows. System Map operationalizes infrastructural inversion: students make explicit the largely implicit systems they've been working within.

**Don Norman's design thinking** provides vocabulary for analyzing infrastructure once it's made visible. Students can examine whether their systems provided appropriate affordances (possibilities), effective constraints (helpful limitations), clear signifiers (indicators of how things work), and useful feedback (information about results). This analytical framework transforms infrastructure documentation from mere description to genuine analysis.

**Clay Spinuzzi's network methodology** (*Network: Theorizing Knowledge Work in Telecommunications*, 2008) demonstrates value of mapping complex workflows visually. Spinuzzi argues that knowledge work involves managing information flows across multiple tools and contexts, and that visualizing these flows reveals both productive arrangements and problematic friction points. System Map applies Spinuzzi's insight to student writing: making workflows visible reveals where students' systems support or hinder their work.

## Implementation Approach

The assignment's flexibility about visual format (flowchart, network diagram, layer model, ecosystem map) recognizes that different students' systems have different structures. Linear workflows benefit from flowcharts. Interconnected tool ecosystems benefit from network diagrams. Students choose formats that match their actual systems rather than forcing all systems into predetermined templates.

The annotation requirement (400-600 words) ensures analytical work accompanies visualization. Without annotations, maps might remain purely descriptive. Annotations push students to examine what maps reveal: Why did bottlenecks appear at particular points? What does the complexity or simplicity of the system suggest about workflow efficiency? Where do improvised solutions indicate gaps in official course infrastructure? This analysis creates actionable insights about students' technology practices.

## Competing Values & Tradeoffs

**Visual work assessment**: System Maps don't fit standard writing assessment criteria. Some maps will be more polished than others based on students' visual literacy and tool access. Assessment focuses on completeness (did they document their actual system?), accuracy (does it represent what they really did?), and analytical depth of annotations (what insights does analysis provide?) rather than visual aesthetics.

**Infrastructure honesty**: Students might be tempted to map idealized systems rather than actual messy workflows. Assignment guidance emphasizes that honest documentation of problems is more valuable than neat fiction. Assessment rewards authenticity—messy but accurate maps receive stronger evaluation than polished but fictional ones.
