## Overview

Eli Review is the platform you'll use for all peer review work in English 101. Rather than exchanging papers by email or sharing documents through Google Drive, Eli Review provides a structured system where you upload drafts, receive assignments to review specific peers' work, write criterion-based feedback, and submit revision plans based on feedback you receive. This guide explains how the peer review assignment structure works—timing, grading, requirements, and how to succeed.

For technical questions about using Eli Review's interface, see Eli Review's own help documentation at [https://elireview.com/support/](https://elireview.com/support/). This guide focuses on how peer review functions as a course assignment.

## Six Cycles, Same Rhythm

You'll complete six peer review cycles across the semester, each worth 40 points. All six cycles follow the same timeline and structure, which means once you learn the rhythm in Cycle 1 (Week 5), you'll know what to expect for the remaining five cycles.

**The six cycles**:
1. **Week 5**: Literacy Narrative (generous protocol - SPQ)
2. **Week 6**: Spec Document (generous protocol - SPQ)
3. **Week 7**: Constraint Audit (evaluative protocol - DES)
4. **Week 8**: BEAM Source Entries (evaluative protocol - DES)
5. **Week 10**: BEAM Portfolio Framing (generous protocol - SPQ)
6. **Week 12**: Documented Inquiry (evaluative protocol - DES)

**Total points**: 240 possible (6 cycles × 40 points each)  
**Lowest score dropped**: Your lowest cycle score is dropped automatically  
**Counted total**: 200 points toward final grade (5 best cycles)

The dropped lowest score accommodates learning curve, life circumstances, or one cycle where you couldn't participate fully. You don't need to request this accommodation—it's automatic.

## The 48-Hour Rhythm (Every Cycle)

Each cycle follows this exact timeline:

### Before Class (Night Before): Draft Upload
**Due**: 11:59pm the night before peer review class session  
**What you submit**: Draft meeting minimum completion threshold (typically 60%)  
**Where**: Eli Review (you'll receive a link via Canvas/email)  
**Why this matters**: Late uploads mean peers can't review your work during class time, which affects their ability to provide feedback

**Your draft is automatically anonymized**: When you upload, Eli Review removes your name. Reviewers see your work but not your identity. This encourages focus on the writing rather than the writer.

### In Class (1 Block, 25 Minutes): Review Demonstration & Start
**What happens**:
- Instructor demonstrates the review criteria for this cycle
- Instructor models what substantive feedback looks like
- You begin reading assigned peer drafts
- You can ask questions about criteria or expectations in real time

**What you start**: Reading and responding to your assigned peer drafts (usually 3-4 drafts)

**What you don't finish**: Most students don't complete all reviews during this 25-minute block—that's expected. This is a start, not a completion deadline.

### After Class (48 Hours): Complete Reviews
**Due**: 11:59pm, 48 hours after class  
**What you complete**: Substantive, criterion-based written feedback for 3-4 assigned peer drafts  
**Where**: Eli Review (same platform where you started reviews)  
**Worth**: 25 points (out of 40 total for the cycle)

**What "substantive" means**: 
- Respond to every criterion with specific observations
- Quote or reference specific passages when possible
- Explain what you notice rather than just checking boxes
- Write enough that the writer understands your feedback (typically 2-4 sentences per criterion)

### After Reviews Due (48 Hours): Revision Plan Submission
**Due**: 11:59pm Friday (48 hours after reviews were due, 96 hours after class)  
**What you submit**: Revision plan consisting of three parts:
1. **Rate feedback helpfulness** (1-5 stars for each review you received)
2. **Sequence revision priorities** (what to address first, second, third)
3. **Write revision approach** (2-3 sentences explaining your plan)

**Where**: Eli Review (you'll see your received feedback and complete revision plan in same interface)  
**Worth**: 15 points (out of 40 total for the cycle)

**Why this matters**: The revision plan demonstrates that you've processed feedback strategically rather than just collecting it. You're not required to implement every suggestion—you're required to think deliberately about which feedback serves your purposes.

### Following Class (1 Block, 25 Minutes): Analytics Discussion
**What happens**:
- Class examines aggregated review data (anonymized patterns)
- Discussion of what reviews reveal about assignment criteria
- Reflection on feedback given and received

**What you learn**: Patterns in peer feedback often reveal shared challenges or opportunities. If most reviewers noted introduction confusion, that's informational for everyone, not just the writers who received that feedback.

## Grading Breakdown (Every Cycle)

**Total per cycle**: 40 points  
**Reviews**: 25 points  
**Revision plan**: 15 points

### Reviews (25 Points)

You earn the full 25 points by:
- Submitting reviews by the 48-hour deadline
- Providing substantive responses to all criteria
- Writing feedback that's specific, thoughtful, and based on the draft you read

**You don't need to be a perfect reviewer**: The 25 points are based on completion and effort, not on being exceptionally insightful. If you read carefully, respond to every criterion thoughtfully, and provide specific observations, you'll earn full points.

**Partial credit**: If you submit reviews late or incomplete (missing responses to some criteria), you'll receive partial credit based on what you completed.

**Zero credit scenarios**:
- Not submitting reviews at all
- Submitting only check-boxes without written responses
- Providing generic feedback that could apply to any draft ("good job," "needs work")

### Revision Plan (15 Points)

You earn the full 15 points by:
- Rating all feedback you received (1-5 stars per review)
- Sequencing revision priorities (what to address first, why)
- Writing 2-3 sentences articulating your revision approach

**Why rating matters**: Rating feedback honestly helps you identify which reviews gave you useful insights and helps the class understand what makes feedback effective. Low ratings don't hurt your peers' grades—they help everyone learn what kinds of feedback are most valuable.

**Why sequencing matters**: You probably won't implement every suggestion you receive. Sequencing shows you can prioritize: what needs to change first because it affects everything else? What can wait? What doesn't serve your purposes? This strategic thinking is crucial for revision.

**Why the written approach matters**: The 2-3 sentences explain your reasoning: "I'll focus first on reorganizing the introduction because three reviewers noted confusion about my main point. Then I'll address evidence quality in body paragraphs. I'm not implementing suggestions to add more personal narrative because my constraint audit needs to stay analytical."

**Partial credit**: If you submit a revision plan but skip rating or don't explain your approach, you'll receive partial credit.

## Common Questions

### "What if I upload my draft late?"

Uploading after the deadline means peers can't review your work during class time. You might receive fewer reviews or lower-quality feedback. Your own review work isn't affected—you can still complete reviews and earn those 25 points—but your draft won't benefit from full peer feedback.

For generative writing checks and participation, late drafts may also affect those components. Aim to meet upload deadlines consistently.

### "What if I submit reviews late?"

Late reviews receive reduced credit based on how late they are. However, "late" is often still useful—if reviews are due Wednesday at 11:59pm and you submit Thursday morning, your peers still get feedback before their revision plan is due Friday. Very late reviews (after revision plans are due) provide no benefit to peers and receive minimal credit.

If circumstances prevent on-time submission, communicate with your instructor and complete what you can as soon as possible.

### "What if I can't complete a cycle at all?"

Your lowest cycle score is automatically dropped, which accommodates one cycle where you genuinely couldn't participate. If you miss multiple cycles due to extended illness, family emergency, or other serious circumstances, communicate with your instructor about accommodation options.

Don't strategically skip a cycle thinking "it won't count"—you lose the learning opportunity and the chance to give peers feedback. The dropped score is a safety net, not an invitation to skip.

### "Can I see who reviewed my work?"

No. Eli Review maintains anonymity in both directions—you don't see who wrote your work, and writers don't see who reviewed them. This anonymity helps reviewers focus on the writing without social dynamics affecting their feedback, and helps writers consider feedback based on its content rather than on who gave it.

After the semester ends, anonymity remains. You'll never know who reviewed specific drafts unless peers choose to tell you outside the platform.

### "What if feedback I receive is unhelpful or wrong?"

This is why you complete a revision plan—to process feedback strategically. You can:
- Rate unhelpful feedback low (1-2 stars)
- Explain in your revision plan why you're not implementing certain suggestions
- Discuss confusing or contradictory feedback with your instructor

Not all feedback you receive will be useful, and that's okay. Your job isn't to follow all feedback blindly—it's to evaluate which feedback serves your revision purposes.

### "What if I don't understand the criteria?"

During the in-class review start time, ask questions about criteria. Your instructor is available to clarify what specific criteria mean and what reviewers should attend to.

If confusion arises while working independently, email your instructor or visit office hours. The criteria exist to focus your attention, and understanding them helps you provide better feedback and use feedback more effectively.

### "Can I review additional peers beyond my assigned 3-4?"

Eli Review only assigns the drafts you're responsible for reviewing. You won't have access to other peers' drafts. This limitation is intentional—it keeps review workload manageable while ensuring everyone receives multiple reviews.

If you're interested in additional practice with review criteria, you could apply the same criteria to your own draft (self-review) or discuss criteria application with peers outside the platform.

### "What happens during analytics discussions?"

The instructor shares anonymized, aggregated data from the review cycle:
- Which criteria were most commonly marked
- Where reviewers agreed or disagreed
- Patterns in feedback across the class

For example: "73% of reviewers noted that introduction paragraphs needed more context" or "Feedback on evidence use was split—some said more evidence, others said better analysis of existing evidence."

These discussions help everyone understand the assignment better and recognize shared challenges. You're not learning just from the 3-4 reviews you wrote or received—you're learning from patterns across the entire class's review work.

## Tips for Success

**Start reviews during class time**: The 25-minute in-class block gives you momentum and ensures you understand criteria before working independently. Students who start during class complete reviews more easily than students who wait until the night before deadline.

**Read drafts carefully before responding**: Skim the draft once to get the overall sense, then read carefully while responding to criteria. Specific feedback requires careful reading—you can't provide useful observations if you've only glanced at the work.

**Use the criteria as thinking prompts**: Each criterion asks you to notice something specific. Before checking a box, write your observation about what you noticed. The check-box is a signal to the writer; your written response is where the value lies.

**Rate feedback honestly**: Don't rate all feedback high just to be nice. Honest ratings help you recognize which reviews actually helped you and help the class identify what makes feedback effective. This isn't about judging peers—it's about evaluating the usefulness of the feedback itself.

**Sequence revisions strategically**: Think about dependencies—what needs to change first because it affects other elements? What's cosmetic and can wait? What doesn't actually need changing despite feedback? This strategic thinking is a crucial skill.

**Use revision plans even if you don't revise immediately**: The revision plan is due 48 hours after reviews, but you might not revise until later. That's fine—the plan documents your thinking at the moment of receiving feedback. When you do revise, you can refer back to your plan.

**Participate in analytics discussions**: The patterns revealed in aggregated data help you understand the assignment and recognize shared challenges. Even if you're satisfied with your own work, these discussions provide valuable insights about academic writing expectations.
