## Overview

The BEAM framework, developed by scholar Joseph Bizup, provides a vocabulary for understanding how sources function in academic writing. Rather than categorizing sources by type (scholarly article, book, website), BEAM categorizes sources by **rhetorical function**—how you're using them in your writing. The four BEAM categories are:

- **Background**: Sources providing context, definitions, or shared knowledge
- **Exhibit**: Primary sources, data, or objects you're analyzing
- **Argument**: Sources making claims you engage with (agree, disagree, complicate)
- **Method**: Sources providing theoretical frameworks or analytical approaches

Understanding BEAM helps you recognize that the same source can serve different functions depending on how you use it, and that effective research requires a mix of functions—not just piling up arguments or only providing background.

---

## The Four BEAM Categories

### Background

**What it does**: Background sources establish context, provide definitions, explain historical information, or offer widely accepted knowledge that readers need to understand your topic.

**When you use it**: 
- To define key terms or concepts
- To establish what's generally known or accepted about your topic
- To provide historical context
- To explain technical or specialized information your readers might not know

**Examples**:
- Encyclopedia or handbook entries defining your topic
- Introductory sections of scholarly articles that overview the field
- Historical accounts providing context for your subject
- Statistical reports establishing the scope of an issue

**How it appears in writing**: "According to the CDC, approximately 20% of American adults experience mental illness each year" (Background establishing scope). "Social media platforms are digital environments where users create profiles, share content, and interact with networks of connections" (Background defining terms).

**Critical distinction**: Background isn't just "simple" or "basic" sources—scholarly sources can provide background when you're using them to establish context rather than engaging their arguments.

### Exhibit

**What it does**: Exhibit sources provide evidence, data, texts, images, or other material that you analyze, interpret, or discuss in your writing. These are your primary sources—the objects of analysis.

**When you use it**:
- When analyzing a text, speech, image, or cultural artifact
- When presenting data you'll interpret
- When offering examples that demonstrate a pattern or trend
- When providing material evidence for claims you're making

**Examples**:
- Literary texts you're analyzing (poems, novels, essays)
- Data sets, statistics, or survey results you're interpreting
- Social media posts, advertisements, or media artifacts you're examining
- Interview transcripts, field observations, or experimental results

**How it appears in writing**: "In her essay 'The Ways of Meeting Oppression,' King writes, 'Acquiescence—while often the easier way—is not the moral way.' This passage reveals how King frames passive acceptance as ethically problematic" (Exhibit text being analyzed). "The survey data shows that 73% of respondents reported increased anxiety when scrolling social media before bed" (Exhibit data being interpreted).

**Critical distinction**: Exhibits are materials you're working on, not sources you're learning from. You're the one doing the interpretive or analytical work with exhibit material.

### Argument

**What it does**: Argument sources make claims, take positions, or present interpretations that you engage with in your writing. These are the voices in the scholarly conversation you're joining—you might agree, disagree, complicate, or synthesize their positions.

**When you use it**:
- When positioning your claims in relation to others' claims
- When supporting your position by showing agreement with established scholarship
- When challenging positions you find problematic or incomplete
- When synthesizing multiple perspectives on a debated question

**Examples**:
- Scholarly articles making arguments about your topic
- Opinion pieces or editorial perspectives you're engaging
- Theoretical claims you're testing or applying
- Research findings that support or challenge your position

**How it appears in writing**: "While Johnson argues that social media creates authentic connection, I find this claim overlooks the performative nature of online self-presentation" (Argument you're challenging). "Building on Smith's framework for understanding digital identity, I argue that..." (Argument you're extending).

**Critical distinction**: You're not just reporting what Argument sources say—you're positioning your thinking in relation to their claims. You have something at stake in how you engage them.

### Method

**What it does**: Method sources provide theoretical frameworks, analytical approaches, research methodologies, or conceptual tools that guide your inquiry. These sources shape how you think about and analyze your topic.

**When you use it**:
- When applying a theoretical framework to your analysis
- When adopting analytical concepts or vocabulary
- When explaining your research approach or methodology
- When using discipline-specific methods for investigation

**Examples**:
- Theoretical texts providing frameworks you apply (Foucault's power theory, feminist criticism, systems thinking)
- Methodological sources explaining research approaches (ethnography, discourse analysis, statistical methods)
- Conceptual sources providing analytical vocabulary (Goffman's "presentation of self," Meadows' "leverage points")
- Foundational texts establishing approaches your field uses

**How it appears in writing**: "Using Meadows' concept of leverage points, I analyze where interventions in this system would create greatest change" (Method providing analytical framework). "Following Goffman's approach to self-presentation, I examine how Instagram users construct identity through strategic visibility management" (Method providing conceptual tools).

**Critical distinction**: Method sources teach you how to think about or analyze something, not what to think about it. They're conceptual tools, not arguments to engage.

## Key Principles of BEAM Classification

### Same Source, Multiple Functions

A single source can serve multiple BEAM functions depending on how you use different parts of it:

**Example**: A scholarly article on social media and mental health might provide:
- **Background** (its introduction surveying prior research)
- **Exhibit** (its data tables showing correlation between usage and anxiety)
- **Argument** (its conclusion claiming causation, which you might challenge)
- **Method** (its research design, which you might adapt)

Your BEAM classification describes how you're using the source, not what type of source it is.

### Classification Follows Use, Not Type

BEAM classification is determined by function in your writing, not by source type:

**NOT BEAM**: "This is a scholarly article, so it's an Argument source"
**BEAM THINKING**: "I'm using this scholarly article's opening section to define key terms (Background) and its central claim to position my own argument against (Argument)"

**NOT BEAM**: "This is a primary source, so it's an Exhibit"  
**BEAM THINKING**: "This primary source provides material I'm analyzing (Exhibit), but when I quote what it says about its own purpose, I'm engaging its argument (Argument)"

### Different Disciplines Emphasize Different Functions

Disciplinary writing conventions affect BEAM distribution:

**Literary studies**: Heavy on Exhibit (analyzing texts) and Argument (engaging critical interpretations), lighter on Background and Method

**Social sciences**: Balance Exhibit (presenting data), Argument (engaging prior research), Method (explaining approach), and Background (establishing context)

**Sciences**: Heavy on Method (research design) and Exhibit (experimental results), lighter on Argument until discussion section

Understanding these patterns helps you recognize what readers expect in different disciplinary contexts.

### Most Research Needs Multiple Functions

Effective research portfolios typically include sources serving all four BEAM functions:

**Why you need Background**: Readers need context to understand what you're discussing and why it matters

**Why you need Exhibits**: You need material to analyze, interpret, or use as evidence for claims

**Why you need Arguments**: You need to position your thinking in relation to existing conversations

**Why you need Method**: You need conceptual tools and frameworks to conduct analysis rigorously

A portfolio with only Argument sources lacks material to analyze and context to ground discussion. A portfolio with only Exhibits and Background lacks the scholarly conversation and analytical frameworks needed for sophisticated work.

## Common BEAM Classification Challenges

### "This source does everything—how do I classify it?"

Classify based on your **primary use** of the source, acknowledging it serves multiple functions:

"This article primarily functions as Argument (I'm engaging its central claim about X), though I also use its literature review section for Background context about the field."

In your annotated bibliography, you might mark it as "Argument (primary), Background (secondary)."

### "I'm just summarizing the source—what function is that?"

Ask yourself **why you're summarizing it**:

- Summarizing to establish what readers need to know → **Background**
- Summarizing to present material you'll analyze → **Exhibit**  
- Summarizing to show what others have argued before engaging those arguments → **Argument**
- Summarizing to explain an approach you're adopting → **Method**

Summary is a rhetorical move you make with sources, not a BEAM function itself.

### "My source is a news article—is that automatically Background?"

Not necessarily! News articles can serve all four functions:

- As **Background**: Establishing current events readers need to know about
- As **Exhibit**: Analyzing the article's rhetoric or how it frames an issue
- As **Argument**: Engaging claims the article makes (especially opinion pieces)
- As **Method**: Examining journalistic approaches as models

Classification depends on your use, not the source's genre.

### "Can something be Background in one paper and Argument in another?"

Absolutely! This is exactly the point of BEAM:

**Paper 1** (about education policy): You cite Smith's article to establish what current graduation rates are (Background)

**Paper 2** (about Smith's methodology): You engage Smith's claims about what graduation rates mean, challenging the interpretation (Argument)

Same source, different functions based on your rhetorical purpose.

## Using BEAM in This Course

### BEAM Source Portfolio (Annotated Bibliography)

Your Movement 3 annotated bibliography uses BEAM organization:

- Classify each source by its primary function(s) in your research
- Write annotations explaining both what the source does and how you'll use it
- Aim for BEAM balance (not all Arguments, not all Background)
- See [[annotated-bibliography-assignment-course-v101]] for complete requirements

### Documented Inquiry (Research Essay)

Your Movement 4 research essay integrates BEAM sources:

- Background sources establish context in introduction/background sections
- Exhibit sources provide material you analyze throughout
- Argument sources appear where you position your claims
- Method sources guide your analytical approach

Effective integration means using sources for their intended BEAM functions, not just dropping quotes randomly.

### BEAM Fragments

Three of your required fragments explore BEAM classification:

- Fragment analyzing a source's potential BEAM functions
- Fragment practicing integration of sources serving different functions
- Fragment reflecting on BEAM balance in your developing research

These fragments help you understand BEAM experientially before completing the annotated bibliography.

## BEAM and Citation Conventions

Your citation style (MLA format in this course) doesn't change based on BEAM function—all sources get proper citations regardless of whether they're Background, Exhibit, Argument, or Method. However, BEAM affects **how you introduce sources**:

**Background**: "According to the WHO, ..." "Research has established that ..." "Historically, ..."

**Exhibit**: "The data shows ..." "In her essay, King writes ..." "The advertisement features ..."

**Argument**: "Johnson argues that ..." "While Smith claims ..., I contend ..." "Building on Lee's framework ..."

**Method**: "Using Foucault's concept of ..." "Following ethnographic approaches, ..." "Applying Meadows' systems analysis ..."

These signal phrases help readers understand your relationship to sources.

**Course applications**: Your instructor will model BEAM classification during M3, demonstrate source integration using BEAM functions, and provide feedback on BEAM classification in your annotated bibliography peer review.

**Questions**: Bring BEAM classification questions to office hours, conference discussions, or class sessions. Learning to classify sources by function takes practice—confusion is normal and productive.
