## Overview

Movement 2's milestone combines two related assignments: a Specification Document (Spec Document) and a Constraint Audit. Together worth 50 points, these assignments introduce you to process documentation practices (articulating intentions and plans) and constraint analysis (examining how constraints shape what's possible). Though completed in sequence and reviewed separately, these assignments work together—the Spec Document articulates intentions for a project, while the Constraint Audit analyzes how constraints shape projects, texts, or systems.

Both assignments draw on course readings in ![[_def-M2-weeks]] and prepare you for the corpus management and research work in Movement 3. By documenting specifications and auditing constraints, you develop vocabulary and practices for analyzing how writing (and other designed objects) emerges from deliberate choices within constraints.

---

## Assignment Integration

Though the Spec Document and Constraint Audit are distinct pieces of writing, they share conceptual foundation: both examine how designers, writers, and makers navigate constraints when creating something. The Spec Document shows you how to articulate intentions and requirements before creating. The Constraint Audit shows you how to analyze constraints in existing texts, processes, or systems. Together, they build [[outcome-constraint-literacy|constraint literacy]] from two directions—production and analysis.

You will receive peer review for each component separately (Spec Document in Week 6 using generous protocol, Constraint Audit in Week 7 using evaluative protocol), allowing you to revise each based on feedback before final submission.

## Part 1: Specification Document

### Context

Specification documents (spec docs) are a genre common in software development, design, and engineering: before building something, teams write specifications articulating what they intend to create, why it matters, who it's for, what requirements it must meet, and what success looks like. Spec docs make intentions explicit and create shared understanding among collaborators. They're also revisable documents—when circumstances change or new information emerges, specs get updated to reflect current understanding.

This assignment asks you to write a spec document for a project you're planning—something you intend to create, build, organize, or accomplish. Your project might be academic (a research paper, a portfolio), personal (learning a skill, organizing a space), professional (a job search, a business plan), or creative (writing a story, recording music, designing something). What matters is that your project is complex enough to require planning and has constraints that shape what's possible.

Your spec document makes your thinking visible. By articulating intentions, requirements, audience, and success criteria, you create a roadmap for yourself and a communication tool for anyone who might collaborate with you (peers, instructors, colleagues, friends). This genre demonstrates [[outcome-process-documentation|process documentation]]—writing that captures planning and decision-making rather than just reporting final outcomes.

### Task

Write a specification document of 600-900 words that articulates a project you plan to undertake, including: the project's purpose and goals, intended audience or stakeholders, key requirements or features, constraints you're working within, success criteria for how you'll know the project succeeded, and timeline or milestones for completion.

### Standards

This component demonstrates your developing abilities across multiple course outcomes:

1. **[[outcome-process-documentation|Process Documentation & Metacognition]]**: Spec documents make visible the thinking that precedes creation, documenting intentions and requirements rather than just describing finished work
2. **[[outcome-rhetorical-awareness|Rhetorical Awareness]]**: Effective specs anticipate audience needs—what information do stakeholders need to understand and support your project?
3. **[[outcome-constraint-literacy|Constraint Literacy]]**: Identifying and articulating constraints shows awareness of how limitations shape what's possible within your project
4. **[[outcome-workflow-technologies|Workflow Technologies]]**: Spec documents are a genre with conventions—you're learning how this documentation genre works and how to adapt it to your purposes
5. **Clarity of purpose**: Your spec articulates _why_ this project matters, not just _what_ it involves
6. **Specificity of requirements**: Requirements are concrete and actionable, not vague aspirations
7. **Realistic constraints**: You acknowledge actual limitations (time, resources, expertise, access) that will shape your project
8. **Measurable success criteria**: Your criteria for success are specific enough that you (and others) could determine whether the project succeeded

Assessment:
- **Spec Document**: 25 points (meeting standards above)
- This component receives formal peer review in Week 6 (Cycle 2, generous protocol)

### Guidance

**Choose a project you're actually planning**. Don't invent a hypothetical project for this assignment—use it to plan something you genuinely intend to do. The spec becomes more valuable when it serves your actual work, and your writing will be more engaged when the project matters to you.

**Be specific about requirements**. Vague statements like "the project should be high quality" don't help. Specific statements like "the video should be 8-12 minutes, include interview footage from at least 3 people, and be exported in 1080p format" give you and potential collaborators clear targets.

**Distinguish between requirements and constraints**. Requirements are what the project _must_ include or accomplish. Constraints are limitations you're working within. For example: "Must include primary research" is a requirement; "Limited to sources accessible through WSU library" is a constraint. Both shape your project but in different ways.

**Think about your audience**. Who needs to understand this spec? If it's just for you, focus on details that will keep you on track. If it's for collaborators or stakeholders, explain context they might not share. If you're seeking approval or resources, emphasize why the project matters and how it's feasible.

**Use the README examples as models**. We'll examine README files (a specific type of spec document used in software development) during Movement 2. These provide concrete examples of how to structure specifications: purpose, features, requirements, usage, contribution guidelines. Your spec doesn't need to follow README structure exactly, but those documents model the kind of clarity and specificity that makes specs useful.

**Remember that specs are revisable**. Don't treat your spec as a contract you can't modify. Specs document _current_ thinking and get updated when you learn new information or circumstances change. The goal is clarity about intentions now, not perfect prediction of future.

## Part 2: Constraint Audit

### Context

A constraint audit systematically examines how constraints shape what's possible in a text, process, or system. Unlike the Spec Document (which looks forward to what you'll create), the Constraint Audit looks analytically at something that already exists—asking: What constraints shaped this? How did those constraints affect choices? What possibilities did constraints enable or foreclose? What happens when constraints conflict?

Your audit might examine constraints in a published text (genre conventions, audience expectations, length limits, citation requirements), a personal process (your own writing process, a skill you're learning, a system you navigate), or a designed system (a video game's mechanics, an app's interface, a building's layout, an organizational structure). Christopher Alexander's [[@alexander1964notet]] concept of "misfits" is useful here—where don't things fit? Where do constraints clash or create problems? These friction points reveal how constraints work.

The Constraint Audit replaces the traditional rhetorical analysis assignment in many composition courses. While rhetorical analysis asks "How does this text persuade or inform?", constraint audit asks "How do constraints shape what this text can do and be?" Both are analytical genres, but constraint audit connects more directly to this course's emphasis on [[outcome-constraint-literacy|constraint literacy]] and process thinking.

### Task

Write a constraint audit of 800-1200 words that systematically analyzes constraints operating in a chosen text, process, or system, identifying at least three distinct constraint types, explaining how each constraint shapes possibilities or choices, examining where constraints conflict or create misfits, and assessing whether constraints are productive (enabling good outcomes) or problematic (creating barriers or inefficiencies).

### Standards

This component demonstrates your developing abilities across multiple course outcomes:

1. **[[outcome-constraint-literacy|Constraint Literacy]]**: Identifying, categorizing, and analyzing constraints develops your understanding of how limitations shape composition and design
2. **[[outcome-critical-thinking|Critical Thinking & Difficulty-as-Diagnostic]]**: Constraint analysis requires recognizing where friction arises and treating difficulty as informational—what do problems reveal about underlying constraints?
3. **[[outcome-rhetorical-awareness|Rhetorical Awareness]]**: Analyzing how genre, audience, and purpose function as constraints shows understanding of rhetorical situation
4. **Systematic analysis**: Your audit examines multiple constraint types and their interactions, not just listing obvious limitations
5. **Evidence-based claims**: Claims about constraints are supported with specific examples from the text, process, or system you're analyzing
6. **Alexander's framework**: Where appropriate, you identify "misfits"—places where form and context clash, revealing constraint conflicts
7. **Evaluative dimension**: You assess whether constraints are productive, problematic, or both, not just describing them neutrally
8. **Clear organization**: Your audit is structured logically—readers can follow your analysis from constraint identification through evaluation

Assessment:
- **Constraint Audit**: 25 points (meeting standards above)
- This component receives formal peer review in Week 7 (Cycle 3, evaluative protocol)

### Guidance

**Choose something you can examine closely**. You need specific evidence for your analysis—direct quotes from a text, concrete examples from a process, observable features of a system. Don't choose something so abstract you can only make general claims.

**Categorize constraints thoughtfully**. Constraints come in different types: genre conventions, resource limitations (time, money, materials), audience expectations, technical requirements, regulatory rules, physical constraints, competing goals. Identifying constraint types helps you analyze how different kinds of limitations shape choices differently.

**Look for constraint interactions and conflicts**. The most interesting analytical work often happens where constraints clash: "The assignment requires five sources, but the library doesn't have access to journals in this field" or "The game wants players to explore freely but also needs to guide them through tutorial content" or "The website must be accessible to screen readers (technical constraint) while also being visually striking (brand constraint)." These conflicts reveal how constraints shape design problems.

**Use Alexander's "goodness of fit" concept from Week 7 reading**. Alexander argues that good design happens when form fits context—when constraints are satisfied rather than just partially met or ignored. Where does your chosen text/process/system achieve goodness of fit? Where are there misfits that create problems? This evaluative dimension turns description into analysis.

**Connect to course readings**. The Constraint Audit should demonstrate engagement with Movement 2 readings—Meadows [[@meadows2008lever]] on systems thinking, Alexander on design constraints, Kirschenbaum on materiality, the README examples on documentation conventions. Reference these readings when they help you explain what you're observing.

**Be analytical, not just descriptive**. Don't just list constraints—explain what they _do_. How do they shape what's possible? What trade-offs do they create? What would be different with different constraints? This analytical move transforms constraint listing into genuine audit.
