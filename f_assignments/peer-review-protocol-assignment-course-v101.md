## Overview

Peer review is a continuous practice throughout this course, not a single assignment. Over the semester, you will participate in six peer review cycles using Eli Review, a platform designed specifically for structured peer feedback. In each cycle, you will read anonymized drafts from classmates, provide criterion-based written feedback, and then use the feedback you receive to plan revisions. This practice develops your ability to read analytically, articulate criteria for effective writing, and use feedback productively—all skills essential for academic and professional writing contexts.

Each peer review cycle is worth 40 points (6 cycles × 40 points = 240 points total, with your lowest score dropped, making 200 points counted toward your final grade).

---

## The Six Cycles

You will complete peer review for these six assignments:

| Cycle | Week | Assignment | Draft State | Review Protocol | Check-box Criteria |
|-------|------|------------|-------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| 1 | Week 5 | Literacy Narrative | 60% minimum complete | Generous (SPQ) | 7 criteria |
| 2 | Week 6 | Spec Document | 60% minimum complete | Generous (SPQ) | 6 criteria |
| 3 | Week 7 | Constraint Audit | 60% minimum complete | Evaluative (DES) | 7 criteria |
| 4 | Week 9 | BEAM Source Entries | 2+ complete entries | Evaluative (DES) | 8 criteria |
| 5 | Week 10 | BEAM Portfolio Framing | 60% minimum complete | Generous (SPQ) | 7 criteria |
| 6 | Week 12 | Documented Inquiry | 60% minimum complete | Evaluative (DES) | 8 criteria |

Specific criteria for each cycle are provided in weekly materials. Each cycle follows the same rhythm and timeline but adapts the review protocol and criteria to match the assignment's goals.

## Two Review Protocols

This course uses two peer review protocols, each suited to different kinds of writing tasks:

### Generous Protocol (SPQ): Sayback-Pointing-Questioning

**When used**: Personal/narrative work, explanatory writing, synthesis and exploration (Cycles 1, 2, 5)

**How it works**:
- **Sayback**: Summarize what you understand the writer to be saying or doing
- **Pointing**: Identify specific passages that work well or that you noticed
- **Questioning**: Ask genuine questions about meaning, purpose, or development

**Purpose**: This protocol prioritizes generative feedback over evaluative judgment. It helps writers see how readers actually experience their work, which can reveal gaps or opportunities that weren't visible during drafting.

### Evaluative Protocol (DES): Describe-Evaluate-Suggest

**When used**: Analytical work, research documentation, advanced research writing (Cycles 3, 4, 6)

**How it works**:
- **Describe**: Identify what the writer is attempting to do
- **Evaluate**: Assess how well the draft meets stated criteria
- **Suggest**: Offer specific strategies for improvement

**Purpose**: This protocol provides directive feedback keyed to explicit success criteria. It helps writers understand which aspects of their work meet expectations and which need further development.

## The 48-Hour Rhythm

Each peer review cycle follows the same timeline:

**Before class (night before)**: Upload your draft to Eli Review by 11:59pm
- Your draft must meet minimum completion threshold (typically 60%)
- Draft is anonymized automatically by Eli Review

**In class (1 block, 25 minutes)**: Begin peer reviews
- Instructor demonstrates review criteria
- You start reading and responding to peer drafts
- Questions addressed in real time

**After class (48 hours)**: Complete peer reviews by 11:59pm
- You will review 3-4 peer drafts (number varies by cycle)
- Write substantive responses to each criterion
- Submit reviews through Eli Review platform

**After reviews due (48 hours)**: Submit revision plan by 11:59pm Friday
- Rate helpfulness of feedback you received (1-5 stars for each review)
- Sequence revisions in priority order (what to address first, second, third)
- Write brief revision plan (2-3 sentences explaining your approach)
- Submit through Eli Review

**Following class (1 block, 25 minutes)**: Analytics discussion
- Class examines aggregated review data
- Discuss patterns in feedback given and received
- Reflect on what reviews reveal about assignment criteria

## Context

Peer review serves multiple purposes in this course. First, it creates structured opportunities to read critically—analyzing how others approach the same assignment helps you recognize strategies you might use and problems you want to avoid. Second, it develops your ability to articulate criteria for effective writing, moving beyond vague reactions like "this is good" toward specific observations like "the evidence here doesn't directly support the claim." Third, it provides multiple perspectives on your work, helping you see possibilities you hadn't considered.

Perhaps most importantly, peer review helps you use feedback productively. The revision plan process—rating, sequencing, and articulating a plan—requires you to be strategic about feedback rather than trying to implement every suggestion you receive. This metacognitive work aligns with [[outcome-composing-processes|Composing Processes]] and [[outcome-critical-thinking|Critical Thinking]], as you must evaluate which feedback serves your purposes and which doesn't.

The two protocols (SPQ and DES) recognize that different writing tasks benefit from different kinds of feedback. Personal narrative doesn't need directive evaluation; it needs genuine reader response. Research documentation does need directive evaluation; it needs assessment against explicit criteria. Using the right protocol at the right time aligns with [[outcome-constraint-literacy|Constraint Literacy]]—understanding that feedback itself is a constraint that shapes revision differently depending on when and how it arrives.

## Task

Complete six peer review cycles across the semester, each consisting of: (1) uploading a draft by deadline, (2) writing substantive criterion-based reviews for 3-4 peer drafts within 48 hours, (3) submitting a revision plan within 48 hours of receiving feedback that rates, sequences, and articulates your approach to revision, and (4) participating in analytics discussions during following class session.

## Standards

This assignment demonstrates your developing abilities across multiple course outcomes:

1. **[[outcome-workflow-technologies|Workflow Technologies & Collaboration]]**: Using Eli Review requires understanding platform affordances, navigating anonymized review processes, and managing deadlines for asynchronous collaboration
2. **[[outcome-rhetorical-awareness|Rhetorical Awareness]]**: Providing useful feedback requires recognizing how different audiences might respond to writing choices and understanding how genre expectations shape what counts as "effective"
3. **[[outcome-critical-thinking|Critical Thinking & Difficulty-as-Diagnostic]]**: Analyzing peer work develops your ability to identify what's working and why, as well as diagnose where difficulty arises and what that difficulty signals
4. **[[outcome-composing-processes|Composing Processes]]**: The revision plan process makes visible how you process feedback and prioritize revision work, demonstrating metacognitive awareness of your own composing practices
5. **Substantive engagement**: Reviews provide specific, criterion-based feedback that helps writers see their work more clearly, not just vague praise or criticism
6. **Timeliness**: Reviews submitted by deadlines create reliable feedback for peers; late reviews diminish the collaborative value of the process
7. **Strategic use of feedback**: Revision plans show you can evaluate feedback critically, sequence priorities thoughtfully, and articulate revision approaches clearly
8. **Participation in analytics discussions**: Engaging with class-level patterns in feedback demonstrates ability to learn from aggregate data about writing and reviewing practices

Assessment for each cycle:
- **Completed peer reviews**: 25 points (substantive responses to all criteria for assigned peer drafts)
- **Revision plan submission**: 15 points (rating feedback, sequencing revisions, writing 2-3 sentence plan)
- **Total per cycle**: 40 points
- **Semester total**: 240 points (lowest 1 cycle dropped = 200 points counted)

See [[grading-assessment-content-v101|Grading & Assessment]] for complete assessment framework.

## Guidance

**Take reviews seriously from Cycle 1**. The first review cycle feels new and unfamiliar, but the habits you establish early matter. If you rush through Cycle 1 reviews, you'll struggle to provide quality feedback later when assignments are more complex. Start with your best effort.

**Use the check-box criteria as thinking prompts, not just boxes to tick**. Each criterion asks you to notice something specific about the draft. Before checking a box, write a substantive response explaining what you observed. The criteria exist to focus your attention, not to reduce feedback to yes/no judgments.

**Be specific in your feedback**. Compare these two responses:
- Weak: "The introduction is confusing"
- Strong: "The introduction's first three sentences seem to be about X, but then the fourth sentence shifts to Y without explaining the connection. I'm not sure which topic the essay will focus on."

The second response helps the writer see exactly where confusion arose and what might need clarification.

**Rate feedback honestly in your revision plan**. Not all feedback you receive will be equally helpful. Rating feedback honestly (1-5 stars) helps you identify which reviews gave you useful insights and helps the class see patterns in what makes feedback helpful. This isn't about liking or disliking peers—it's about evaluating which feedback serves your revision work.

**Sequence your revisions strategically**. You probably won't implement every suggestion you receive. That's appropriate—you're the author making decisions about your work. The revision plan asks you to prioritize: what needs to change first because it affects everything else? What can wait? What doesn't serve your purposes? This strategic sequencing is a crucial skill.

**Participate actively in analytics discussions**. When the class examines aggregated review data, you'll see patterns: "Most reviews mentioned that introduction paragraphs need more context" or "Feedback on evidence use was split—some said more evidence, some said better analysis of existing evidence." These patterns reveal shared challenges and opportunities. Your insights during these discussions help everyone, including you, understand the assignment better.
