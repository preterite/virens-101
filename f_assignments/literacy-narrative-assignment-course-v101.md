## Overview

The Literacy Narrative is Movement 1's milestone assignment, worth 50 points and due Week 5. This assignment asks you to narrate how you learned to do something—reading, writing, or any other skill or practice where you developed competence over time. Unlike traditional literacy narratives that focus only on reading and writing, this assignment recognizes that all learning involves navigating constraints, developing strategies, and reflecting on processes. Your narrative should help readers understand both what you learned and how you learned it.

The assignment has two components: (1) a literacy narrative of 800-1200 words, and (2) a constraint experiment where you compress your narrative through three versions (300 words → 200 words → 100 words), exploring how radical constraint affects meaning and form.

---

## Context

Literacy narratives are common in composition courses because they allow you to write from your own experience while developing academic writing skills—structuring a narrative, using concrete detail, analyzing significance, and reflecting on learning processes. This assignment frames literacy broadly: you might write about learning to read music, navigate a video game's mechanics, use design software, speak a language, cook in a professional kitchen, code in Python, or understand football strategy. What matters is that you learned something complex enough to have taken time, encountered obstacles, and developed competence.

The constraint experiment component introduces you to one of this course's core principles: [[outcome-constraint-literacy|constraint literacy]]. By compressing your narrative from 300 to 200 to 100 words, you will experience how constraints aren't just restrictions—they're design parameters that force decisions about what matters most. This experiential understanding of constraint will inform your work throughout the semester.

The assignment builds directly on fragment production work in ![[_def-M1-weeks]]. Your three preparatory fragments (narrative sketch #1, sensory detail sketch, narrative sketch #2) provide the raw material for your literacy narrative. This demonstrates [[outcome-textual-accumulation|textual accumulation]]—you don't start from scratch but build on existing work.

---

## Task

Write a literacy narrative of 800-1200 words that narrates your learning process for a chosen skill or practice, using concrete sensory detail and reflection on both what you learned and how you learned it, then complete a constraint experiment by producing three compressed versions (300 words, 200 words, 100 words) that explore how radical constraint affects what you can preserve and what you must abandon.

---

## Standards

This assignment demonstrates your developing abilities across multiple course outcomes:

1. **[[outcome-composing-processes|Composing Processes]]**: The preparatory fragments and multiple versions show iteration and revision as central to composing, not just cleanup after drafting
2. **[[outcome-critical-thinking|Critical Thinking & Difficulty-as-Diagnostic]]**: Reflecting on your learning process requires analyzing where difficulty arose and what that difficulty revealed about the skill you were learning
3. **[[outcome-constraint-literacy|Constraint Literacy]]**: The compression exercise makes constraint sequencing visible—you experience how different word limits require different strategic choices
4. **[[outcome-process-documentation|Process Documentation]]**: Your narrative itself is a form of process documentation, tracing how learning happened over time rather than just reporting final competence
5. **Narrative coherence**: The narrative has clear organization—readers can follow the chronology and progression of your learning
6. **Concrete detail**: The narrative uses specific, sensory language rather than abstract generalizations (showing rather than telling)
7. **Significance**: The narrative explains why this learning matters, not just what happened
8. **Compression craft**: The three constrained versions demonstrate thoughtful decisions about what to preserve, condense, or eliminate—not just arbitrary cutting

Assessment:
- **Literacy narrative**: 35 points (meeting standards above)
- **Constraint experiment**: 15 points (completing three versions with evidence of strategic compression)
- **Total**: 50 points

This assignment receives formal peer review in Week 5 (Cycle 1, generous protocol). See [[peer-review-protocol-assignment-course-v101|Peer Review Protocol]] for details.

## Guidance

**Choose a skill with genuine complexity**. Don't pick something you learned in an afternoon—pick something that took time, included setbacks, and required developing strategies. The richer your learning experience, the more you'll have to write about. Good choices often involve skills where you remember specific moments of confusion, breakthrough, or unexpected difficulty.

**Use concrete sensory detail**. Abstract statements like "I struggled at first" don't help readers experience your learning process. Concrete details do: "The sheet music looked like fence posts floating in white space—I couldn't see patterns, just individual notes I had to decode one by one." Concrete detail makes the narrative vivid and helps readers understand what your experience felt like.

**Reflect on process, not just progress**. Don't just report "I learned X, then Y, then Z." Analyze how you learned: What strategies worked? What obstacles surprised you? When did you realize you were getting better, and how did you know? What would you do differently now? This metacognitive work connects to [[outcome-process-documentation|process documentation]] practices we'll use all semester.

**Build on your preparatory fragments**. You've already written three fragments for this assignment—two narrative sketches and one sensory detail sketch. Mine those fragments for material. You don't need to use everything you wrote, but starting with existing material is easier than starting from blank page. This demonstrates how [[outcome-textual-accumulation|textual accumulation]] works: earlier writing becomes capital for later work.

**Approach the constraint experiment strategically**. When compressing from 300 to 200 to 100 words, you're making design decisions: What's essential to preserve? What can readers infer even if you don't state it explicitly? What details carry the most meaning? These aren't easy questions—that's the point. Struggle with them. The constraint experiment isn't about finding the "right" compressed version but about experiencing how constraints force prioritization.

**Use peer review to test reader understanding**. In Week 5, peers will review your literacy narrative using the generous protocol (Sayback-Pointing-Questioning). Their responses will show you what came through clearly and what confused them. Use this feedback to revise before final submission.
