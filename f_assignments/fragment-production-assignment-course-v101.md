## Overview

Fragment production is the foundational writing practice of this course. Rather than completing discrete assignments that start and end on specific dates, you will write regularly throughout the semester to build an accumulating corpus of textual material. Each piece you write—called a fragment—becomes part of your intellectual capital, available for revision, connection, and integration into larger projects.

By Week 12, you will have produced ![[_def-fragment-target-total]] (![[_def-fragment-production-rate]]), creating a substantial body of work that demonstrates sustained engagement with ideas, sources, and your own developing thinking.

---

## What Is a Fragment?

A **fragment** is ![[_def-fragment-definition]], typically ![[_def-fragment-wordcount-range]].

Fragments are not:
- Freewriting exercises discarded after completion
- Rough drafts of predetermined assignments
- Journal entries with no rhetorical purpose

Fragments are:
- Building blocks for future work
- Evidence of thinking-in-progress
- Reusable intellectual capital
- Material for revision, connection, and synthesis

Each fragment you write over ![[_def-semester-weeks]] has potential value beyond its initial context. What you write in Week 2 might become part of your final portfolio in Week 15. What starts as a response to a reading might transform into the foundation of a researched argument.

---

## Fragment Production Target

**Total target**: 38-52 fragments across the semester<br/>
**Core target**: 40-50 fragments by Week 12

This target includes both **required fragments** (those tied to specific course work) and **flexible fragments** (those where you choose the topic within given constraints).

### Required Fragments (27-32 total)

These fragments are connected to course readings, assignments, and reflective work:

**Reading-Anchored Fragments** (10-15 total)
- You will complete at least 10 reading response fragments from the 15 assigned readings
- Choose which readings to write about based on your interests and needs
- See individual reading guides in weekly materials for specific guidance

**Difficulty Fragments** (2 minimum)
- You must complete at least one "difficulty pair" (2 fragments total)
- **Pair A**: Salvatori (Week 2) + Meadows (Week 5)
- **Pair B**: Star & Bowker (Week 11) + Alexander (Week 7)
- Additional difficulty fragments welcome anytime
- See [[12_reading_theory_and_practice|Reading Theory and Practice]] for difficulty-as-diagnostic framework

**Assignment-Preparatory Fragments** (10 required)
- These fragments generate material for major assignments:
  - Literacy Narrative preparation: 3 fragments
  - Constraint experiment: 1 fragment (contains 3 versions)
  - Spec Document preparation: 1 fragment
  - Constraint Audit preparation: 1 fragment
  - BEAM/Annotated Bibliography work: 3 fragments
  - Documented Inquiry planning: 1 fragment
  - Process Archaeology preparation: 1 fragment
  - Transfer Proposal: 1 fragment
- See individual assignment sheets for specific requirements

**Process-Tracking Fragments** (5 required)
- Conference preparation (Week 9): 1 fragment
- End-of-movement reflections (M1, M2, M3, M4): 4 fragments
- These fragments document your composing processes and metacognitive awareness

### Flexible Fragments (11-20 total)

These fragments give you choice within course constraints:

**Instructor-Prompt Fragments** (5-6 required)
- Throughout the semester, instructor-provided prompts will be released (10-12 total available)
- You must complete 5-6 of these prompts:
  - At least 1 in Movement 1 (Weeks 1-3)
  - At least 2 in Movement 2 (Weeks 4-7)
  - Remaining 2-3 in Movements 3-4 (your choice)
- Once released, prompts remain available through the semester
- See [[instructor-prompt-framework-course-v101|Instructor Prompt Framework]] for details

**Open-Topic Fragments** (remaining flexible blocks)
- After meeting instructor-prompt requirements, remaining writing blocks are yours
- Choose your own topics within any constraints specified for that week
- These fragments demonstrate your developing interests and agency

## Fragment Taxonomy

Understanding fragment types helps you see how different kinds of writing serve different purposes:

| Type | Code | Purpose | Example |
|------|------|---------|---------|
| Reading-anchored | R | Respond to assigned reading | Fragment engaging with Ong's "Writing restructures consciousness" |
| Assignment-preparatory | A | Generate material for major assignment | Narrative sketch for Literacy Narrative |
| Process-tracking | P | Document workflow, reflect on difficulty | M1 reflection, conference prep |
| Open-topic | O | Student choice within constraints | Fragment on any topic meeting week's constraints |
| Constraint-experiment | C | Test specific formal constraint | 300→200→100 word compression exercise |

You don't need to label your fragments with these codes. This taxonomy exists to help you recognize the variety of writing you're doing and how each type contributes to your developing corpus.

---

## Context

This course treats writing as both labor (the verb: composing, revising, connecting) and capital (the noun: accumulated text that holds value over time). Traditional composition courses organize around discrete assignments—you write Assignment 1, submit it, and move on to Assignment 2. This approach can make writing feel episodic, with each project starting from scratch. It also can waste the thinking you've already done, treating earlier work as disposable rather than foundational.

Fragment production changes this dynamic. You write regularly throughout the semester, producing ![[_def-fragment-production-rate]]. Each fragment becomes part of your corpus—your collection of accumulated material. As your corpus grows, you begin mining it for patterns, connections, and potential. Work from Week 2 doesn't disappear; it remains available for revision, integration, or extension. By Week 12, you will have a substantial body of work (![[_def-fragment-target-total]]) that represents sustained intellectual engagement.

This approach aligns with [[outcome-textual-accumulation|Textual Accumulation & Intellectual Capital]] and [[outcome-composing-processes|Composing Processes]], emphasizing writing as ongoing practice rather than periodic performance. It also supports [[outcome-constraint-literacy|Constraint Literacy]] by allowing you to experience how constraints shape what's possible at different moments in the semester.

---

## Task

Produce 38-52 fragments over the semester (targeting 40-50 by Week 12), including all required reading-anchored, assignment-preparatory, and process-tracking fragments, plus 5-6 instructor-prompt fragments and remaining open-topic fragments, with each fragment containing ![[_def-fragment-definition]] in ![[_def-fragment-wordcount-range]].

---

## Standards

This assignment demonstrates your developing abilities across multiple course outcomes:

1. **[[outcome-textual-accumulation|Textual Accumulation & Intellectual Capital]]**: Your corpus represents sustained writing practice that builds intellectual capital over time rather than treating each writing task as isolated
2. **[[outcome-composing-processes|Composing Processes]]**: Regular fragment production establishes daily writing practice, iteration, and revision as central to your composing processes
3. **[[outcome-constraint-literacy|Constraint Literacy]]**: Different fragment types introduce constraints at strategic moments, helping you experience how timing affects what constraints enable or restrict
4. **[[outcome-critical-thinking|Critical Thinking & Difficulty-as-Diagnostic]]**: Difficulty fragments transform resistance into informational signal, while reading-anchored fragments practice making claims with evidence
5. **[[outcome-process-documentation|Process Documentation & Metacognition]]**: Process-tracking fragments document your evolving understanding of your own composing practices
6. **Sufficient length and detail**: Each fragment is substantial enough (![[_def-fragment-wordcount-range]]) to develop a claim with supporting evidence, not just assert an opinion
7. **Consistency over time**: Fragments appear regularly throughout the semester (![[_def-fragment-production-rate]]), demonstrating sustained engagement rather than sporadic effort
8. **Portfolio foundation**: Your corpus provides the material from which you will select, revise, and synthesize work for your final portfolio

Assessment of fragment production is integrated into multiple grading components:
- **Participation** (100 points): Daily writing blocks count toward participation
- **Generative writing** (100 points): 14 generative writing checks across semester (lowest 4 dropped)
- **Portfolio** (450 points): Final portfolio draws from your accumulated fragments

See [[grading-assessment-content-v101|Grading & Assessment]] for complete assessment framework.

## Guidance

**Start immediately and write consistently**. The fragment production system rewards regular engagement over sporadic intensity. Writing 3-4 fragments per week across 15 weeks is manageable; trying to write 40 fragments in the final month is not. Use in-class writing blocks for actual writing—this is your protected production time.

**Track your fragments as you go**. Maintain a list or index of what you've written so you can see patterns, identify gaps, and plan future work. Your corpus is most valuable when you know what's in it. Consider organizing fragments by type (reading-anchored, assignment-prep, process-tracking) or by theme (education, technology, difficulty).

**Choose reading responses strategically**. You need 10 of 15 reading fragments—choose readings that interest you, connect to your assignment topics, or challenge your thinking. Don't write about a reading just because it's assigned; write about it because engaging with it serves your intellectual work.

**Meet movement-based requirements early**. You need at least 1 instructor-prompt fragment in M1 and at least 2 in M2. Don't wait until the end of each movement to fulfill these requirements. Early completion gives you more flexibility later in the semester.

**Remember that fragments are building blocks, not finished products**. A fragment doesn't need to be polished or complete—it needs to be substantial and useful. You will revise, extend, and connect fragments throughout the semester. What matters now is producing material; what matters later is transforming it.

**Use flexible blocks to explore interests**. After meeting required fragments, open-topic blocks let you write about what matters to you. These fragments often become the most interesting material in your portfolio because they represent your genuine intellectual curiosity.
