## Context

The final week balances forward-looking transfer thinking with backward-looking celebration. Transfer research shows that explicit articulation of what's portable improves actual transfer to new contexts. Celebration provides closure and acknowledges accomplishment. These dual reflections help students recognize both what they've learned and what they'll carry forward.

## Task

Write two separate short responses (each approximately 100-150 words): (1) **Transfer**: What from this course matters beyond this course—which practice, concept, or vocabulary term will be most useful in future writing contexts (other courses, work, life), and why that one specifically? (2) **Celebration**: What are you proud of accomplishing this semester—what work, growth, or achievement deserves recognition?

## Standards

- **[[outcome-composing-processes]]**: Demonstrates metacognitive awareness of learning and development
- **[[outcome-process-documentation]]**: Documents semester trajectory through reflective synthesis
- **[[outcome-critical-thinking]]**: Identifies specific, defensible reasons for transfer predictions and celebration
- **Concrete specificity**: Both responses reference specific course elements and personal accomplishments

## Guidance

For transfer: Don't just name a concept—explain why it transfers. Will constraint thinking help you analyze future assignments? Will process documentation serve workplace projects? Will BEAM help you evaluate sources across disciplines? Connect the transferable element to plausible future scenarios. For celebration: What felt impossible in Week 1 that you accomplished? What exceeded your expectations? What represents growth you're genuinely pleased about? This isn't self-promotion—it's honest acknowledgment of work done.
