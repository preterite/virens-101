# Instructor Prompt: Technological Literacy Experience

> [!info] Instructor Prompt
> **Block**: 1.2 (Week 1)
> **Movement**: M1 - Surfacing
> **Suggested word count**: ![[_def-fragment-wordcount-range]]

## Context

This prompt provides accessible entry into narrative writing early in the semester when students have minimal conceptual vocabulary and are working primarily from personal experience. The focus on technological systems (broadly defined) warms up narrative thinking that will feed into the Literacy Narrative assignment while establishing that "literacy" extends beyond traditional reading and writing.

## Task

Choose a technological system you learned to use (gaming system, smartphone, social media platform, musical instrument, campus add-drop system, checking account, computer app, etc.) and narrate aspects of why, when, where, and how you learned it, including influences, obstacles, and milestones from novice through developing experience and possible obsolescence.

## Standards

- **[[outcome-composing-processes]]**: Demonstrates narrative development showing learning over time
- **[[outcome-textual-accumulation]]**: Produces material that can serve Literacy Narrative preparation
- **Narrative specificity**: Includes concrete details about the learning process (specific obstacles, influences, moments of progress)
- **Scope appropriate**: Focuses on one system rather than surveying multiple technologies

## Guidance

Consider systems you use daily without thinking—those often have the richest learning stories because you've forgotten the difficulty of becoming fluent. What surprised you about learning this system? Where did you struggle? Who or what helped you develop competence? If the system has become obsolete for you (replaced by newer technology or abandoned), what does that reveal about how technological literacy works?
