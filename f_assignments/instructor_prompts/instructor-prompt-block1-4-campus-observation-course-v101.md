## Context

This prompt introduces observational writing grounded in local, accessible contexts. By focusing on campus locations with "secret histories"—aspects not widely known—students practice gathering information from direct observation, memory, and accessible sources while developing awareness of how knowledge is constructed and verified. The emphasis on provenance ("how do you know?") begins establishing habits of source awareness.

## Task

Choose a campus location and explore its secret histories: physically visit the location and take a picture; describe it with sensory detail beyond what the picture shows; explain what you know about it (rumors, documents, background, organizational purpose, who goes/works/lives/plays there, what's allowed and what's not); most importantly, for each claim explain how you know—from observation, from rumors, from documents, from experience.

## Standards

- **[[outcome-rhetorical-awareness]]**: Shows awareness that different claims require different kinds of evidence
- **[[outcome-source-evaluation]]**: Distinguishes between direct observation, memory, rumor, and documented information
- **[[outcome-composing-processes]]**: Integrates visual evidence (photo) with textual description
- **Sensory specificity**: Includes concrete sensory details that go beyond what's visible in the photo

## Guidance

Good "secret histories" include details that aren't obvious to casual visitors—the story behind a building's name, what the space was used for previously, unwritten social rules about who uses the space when, anecdotes about events that happened there. The "how do you know?" question is crucial: distinguish between what you observed directly, what you've heard (and from whom), what you've read, and what you're inferring. This practice of tracking provenance will serve you throughout research work.
