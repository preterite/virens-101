## Context

Having read Ong's "Writing Restructures Consciousness," students now have theoretical vocabulary for understanding how technologies shape thinking. This revision prompt asks students to return to their Block 1.2 technological literacy fragment (or another early fragment or Literacy Narrative section) and rewrite it through Ong's lens, exploring how the technological system they learned didn't just help them accomplish tasks but actually restructured how they think, remember, and understand.

## Task

Return to your Block 1.2 technological literacy fragment, or another early fragment or Literacy Narrative draft section. Read it as if someone else wrote it—with curiosity rather than ownership. Then revise it to explore how the system you learned structured your thinking and learning.

As you revise, work through these questions:

**On specificity and perspective**:
- From a perspective not your own, where does this fragment require specificity to set it apart from your classmates' narratives? What details would make this recognizably *yours* rather than generic?
- What will others not recognize in this fragment, or fail to understand the implications of? Where do you assume shared knowledge that isn't shared?

**On what's missing**:
- What does the fragment ignore or shut down, and why? What aspects of learning this system did you skip over or avoid naming?
- What productive questions does the fragment raise that it doesn't pursue? Where did you stop when you could have kept going?

**On consciousness and cognition (Ong's lens)**:
- What did the technology enable you to think or do that you couldn't before? What did it constrain or make difficult?
- How did becoming fluent change not just what you could accomplish but how your mind worked?
- Ong argues technologies become "interior to consciousness"—can you identify moments when the system became part of how you think rather than just a tool you use?

The revision itself is the response. Your revised fragment should show evidence of this rethinking—not as added commentary, but woven into the narrative itself.

## Standards

- **[[outcome-critical-thinking]]**: Applies Ong's theoretical framework to personal experience, moving beyond obvious observations
- **[[outcome-composing-processes]]**: Demonstrates revision as reconceptualization, not just editing
- **[[outcome-constraint-literacy]]**: Recognizes how technologies both enable and constrain thinking
- **Theoretical integration**: Uses Ong's concepts (orality/literacy, interiorization, restructuring) to see the experience differently
- **Specificity**: Revision adds concrete details that distinguish this narrative from generic accounts

## Guidance

Don't just add a paragraph about Ong to your earlier fragment—genuinely revise the whole piece to explore consciousness and cognition. Consider: Did the technology change how you remember information? How you organize thoughts? What patterns you notice? What relationships you perceive?

The questions above aren't a checklist to answer one by one. They're lenses to help you see your own writing differently. You might find that pursuing one question deeply is more productive than touching all of them superficially.

If it helps, mark or highlight places where you made significant changes, and be prepared to discuss what prompted them. The gap between past-self and present-self is the point—noticing that gap is what Salvatori calls "metacognitive interruption."
