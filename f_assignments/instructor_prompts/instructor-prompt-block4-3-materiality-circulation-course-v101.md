## Context

Building on Kirschenbaum's work on materiality and the "textpocalypse," this prompt asks students to consider the afterlife of digital writing—where it goes, how it circulates, what traces it leaves. The focus on mobility and surveillance connects personal writing practices to larger systems of data collection, platform architecture, and institutional memory, extending the materiality discussion beyond paper-versus-digital to questions of circulation and permanence.

## Task

Explore what happens to your writing after you submit it: Where does your writing go once it enters digital systems (social media, Canvas, email, cloud storage)? How does "writing" at various scales circulate with you, follow you, and define you (cookies, metadata, search histories, recommendation algorithms, institutional records)? Draw parallels to academic citation systems where appropriate.

## Standards

- **[[outcome-workflow-technologies]]**: Demonstrates understanding of how platforms mediate and store writing
- **[[outcome-constraint-literacy]]**: Identifies how platform constraints shape writing's circulation and persistence
- **[[outcome-rhetorical-awareness]]**: Shows awareness of how different platforms create different writing afterlives
- **Concrete examples**: Grounds abstract claims about circulation with specific platforms or systems you use

## Guidance

Consider both social media (posts, stories, comments that circulate beyond original context) and institutional writing (assignments stored on servers, evaluations that follow you, recommendation letters that archive representations of you). What control do you have over writing once it's submitted? What happens when platforms change terms of service, shut down, or get purchased? How is the circulation of your writing similar to or different from how citations circulate in academic work?
