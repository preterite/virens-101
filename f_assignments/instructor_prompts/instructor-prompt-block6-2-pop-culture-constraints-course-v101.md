## Context

After engaging with Meadows on systems thinking and Alexander on design constraints, students can apply these frameworks to systems they know intimately—favorite movies, shows, or games. Pop culture systems make excellent subjects for constraint analysis because students are experts in how they work, allowing sophisticated analysis without research. The familiar context makes abstract concepts concrete.

## Task

Choose a favorite movie, show, or game that you know well enough to analyze in depth; briefly summarize it, then describe the constraint system it operates within using Meadows' or Alexander's terms: What limitations shape what's possible in this system? Where do constraints clash (Alexander's misfits)? Where are there leverage points (Meadows) where small changes could create big effects?

## Standards

- **[[outcome-constraint-literacy]]**: Identifies multiple constraint types and analyzes their interactions
- **[[outcome-critical-thinking]]**: Applies theoretical frameworks (Meadows/Alexander) to concrete examples
- **[[outcome-rhetorical-awareness]]**: Recognizes how genre, medium, and audience function as constraints
- **Framework application**: Uses Meadows' and/or Alexander's concepts explicitly, not just loosely

## Guidance

Consider constraints like: runtime/episode length, budget, platform/medium, genre conventions, audience expectations, technological capabilities, narrative structure, gameplay mechanics, character development needs. Look for Alexander-style misfits: Where do narrative demands clash with runtime limits? Where do gameplay mechanics conflict with story coherence? Identify Meadows-style leverage points: What small changes would dramatically alter the system—changing perspective, removing a character, shifting one rule?
