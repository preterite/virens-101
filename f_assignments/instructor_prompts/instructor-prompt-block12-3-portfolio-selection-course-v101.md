## Context

As students approach portfolio assembly, they face selection decisions: which fragments deserve inclusion? This prompt asks students to develop explicit selection criteria by first identifying specific fragments they'd include, then articulating the principles underlying those choices. By working from concrete examples to abstract criteria, students develop portfolio philosophy grounded in their actual work rather than imported standards.

## Task

Identify 2-3 specific fragments from your corpus that you believe deserve portfolio inclusion; for each, briefly explain what makes it portfolio-worthy; then step back and articulate the selection criteria you're discovering through these examples—what counts as evidence of excellence? Progress? Your idiosyncratic perspective that shows how you've been learning?

## Standards

- **[[outcome-critical-thinking]]**: Develops selection criteria from evidence rather than applying pre-determined standards
- **[[outcome-textual-accumulation]]**: Demonstrates ability to evaluate accumulated work strategically
- **[[outcome-process-documentation]]**: Articulates metacognitive awareness of what makes work strong
- **Criteria specificity**: Moves beyond vague qualities ("good writing") to concrete, defensible principles

## Guidance

Consider what "portfolio-worthy" means: Is it polish and correctness? Intellectual risk-taking? Evidence of growth from early to late semester? Distinctive voice or perspective? Complexity of thinking? Revision depth? Your criteria might emphasize different values—some portfolios showcase excellence, others demonstrate learning trajectory, others highlight unique approaches. What matters is articulating defensible reasons for inclusion that emerge from examining your actual strongest work.
