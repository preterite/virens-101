## Context

Inspired by Jackson's hypertext experiments and Bernstein's concept of revision as radical re-visioning, this prompt invites students to transform an existing fragment through experimental form. Rather than improving prose through editing, students reconceive what the fragment could be if freed from linear, paragraph-based constraints. The experiment explores how form shapes meaning and what becomes possible when conventional structures are abandoned.

## Task

Choose one of your existing fragments and transform it using experimental form—visual layout, spatial arrangement, hyperlinked structure, mixed media, non-linear organization, or other unconventional approaches; then write a ![[_def-fragment-wordcount-range]] reflection explaining what the experimental form enables that traditional prose doesn't, what you discovered through the transformation, and how constraint shaped both versions.

## Standards

- **[[outcome-composing-processes]]**: Demonstrates revision as reconceptualization, exploring how form and meaning interact
- **[[outcome-constraint-literacy]]**: Recognizes how formal constraints (linearity, paragraphs) shape what's expressible
- **[[outcome-workflow-technologies]]**: Experiments with platform affordances beyond default text editor capabilities
- **Substantive transformation**: Goes beyond cosmetic changes to genuinely reconceive the fragment's structure

## Guidance

Experimental possibilities include: spatial/visual arrangement on page, color or typography as meaning-making, branching/choose-your-path structure, image-text integration, diagrammatic or schematic organization, erasure/redaction, fragmentation/collage. The goal isn't polish or "correctness"—it's exploration. What can you express through spatial arrangement that linear prose can't? What relationships become visible through unconventional structure? Your reflection should analyze what the experiment revealed about form's relationship to meaning.
