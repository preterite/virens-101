# Instructor Prompt: Conference Questions & Format Choices

> [!info] Instructor Prompt<br/>
> **Block**: 9.4 (Week 9)<br/>
> **Movement**: M3 - Operating at Scale<br/>
> **Suggested word count**: ![[_def-fragment-wordcount-range]]

> [!warning] Homework Assignment (Unusual)<br/>
> Unlike other instructor prompts, this prompt is assigned as **homework TO conference week**—students complete it before their individual meeting and bring it as a revisable document. This is one of the few writing assignments in this course done outside of class time.

## Context

Conference week creates space for individual conversations about student progress, challenges, and directions. This prompt serves dual purposes: it generates material for productive conference discussions while introducing explicit thinking about format choices—when to use structured data versus prose, and how format affects meaning. The metacognitive reflection on format choice extends constraint literacy to rhetorical decision-making.

**Conference workflow**: Students bring this fragment plus questions to their 30-minute individual meeting. During the conference, instructor and student revise the document together, identifying directions for remaining work. Students leave with instructor email notes summarizing the conversation and concrete next steps. Some students arrive unprepared—the prompt format allows writing with a template during the meeting if necessary.

## Task

Respond to two questions: (1) "What questions do you want to explore in your conference?" and (2) "What directions interest you for remaining work?"—present one as structured data (list, table, bullets) and one as carefully organized prose paragraph, then in 2-3 sentences discuss why you chose which format for which question.

## Standards

- **[[outcome-process-documentation]]**: Documents mid-semester thinking about progress and future directions
- **[[outcome-rhetorical-awareness]]**: Demonstrates understanding that format choices affect how content is understood
- **[[outcome-composing-processes]]**: Reflects on own composing trajectory and plans future work
- **Format intentionality**: Explains rationale for format choices rather than making arbitrary decisions

## Guidance

Consider what each format enables: structured data makes relationships visible, allows quick scanning, emphasizes discrete items; prose develops connections, creates narrative flow, allows qualification and nuance. Which question benefits from which affordances? Your conference questions might include concerns about specific assignments, curiosity about concepts, questions about process or workflow. Your future directions might explore new topics, deepen existing work, or experiment with forms you haven't tried yet.
