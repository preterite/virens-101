# Instructor Prompt: Concept Evolution Across Corpus

> [!info] Instructor Prompt

## Context

By Week 8, students have accumulated 25-30 fragments containing recurring concepts, themes, or concerns. This prompt asks students to trace how a concept has evolved across their corpus, trusting their instinctive sense that something has shifted rather than conducting systematic content analysis. The practice develops corpus awareness—recognizing patterns across accumulated work—and demonstrates how writing develops ideas over time through iteration rather than single comprehensive treatment.

## Task

Choose one concept from your corpus that seems to you (by feel, gut sense, instinct) to have shifted or evolved over time; trace how this concept appears across multiple fragments, showing how it accumulated, operated in different contexts, or changed meaning; analyze what the evolution reveals about your thinking or the concept itself.

## Standards

- **[[outcome-textual-accumulation]]**: Demonstrates ability to work with accumulated corpus, recognizing patterns across fragments
- **[[outcome-critical-thinking]]**: Analyzes concept evolution rather than just cataloging appearances
- **[[outcome-process-documentation]]**: Documents intellectual development through corpus rather than single-text analysis
- **Multiple fragments**: References at least 3-4 fragments showing concept's trajectory

## Guidance

Trust your instincts about what's shifted—often we sense evolution before we can articulate it. The concept might be course vocabulary (constraint, process, accumulation), personal themes (difficulty, learning, technology), or recurring situations (frustration with systems, moments of clarity, resistance to requirements). Look for: How did you first use this concept? Where did meaning deepen or change? Where did the concept connect to other ideas? What would you say about this concept now that you couldn't have said in Week 2?
