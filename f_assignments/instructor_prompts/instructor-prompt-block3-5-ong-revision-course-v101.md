## Context

Having read Ong's "Writing Restructures Consciousness," students now have theoretical vocabulary for understanding how technologies shape thinking. This revision prompt asks students to return to their Block 1.2 technological literacy fragment and rewrite it through Ong's lens, exploring how the technological system they learned didn't just help them accomplish tasks but actually restructured how they think, remember, and understand.

## Task

Revise your Block 1.2 technological literacy fragment to explore how the system you learned structured your thinking and learning: What did the technology enable you to think or do that you couldn't before? What did it constrain or make difficult? How did becoming fluent change not just what you could accomplish but how your mind worked?

## Standards

- **[[outcome-critical-thinking]]**: Applies Ong's theoretical framework to personal experience, moving beyond obvious observations
- **[[outcome-composing-processes]]**: Demonstrates revision as reconceptualization, not just editing
- **[[outcome-constraint-literacy]]**: Recognizes how technologies both enable and constrain thinking
- **Theoretical integration**: Uses Ong's concepts (orality/literacy, interiorization, restructuring) explicitly

## Guidance

Don't just add a paragraph about Ong to your earlier fragment—genuinely revise the whole piece to explore consciousness and cognition. Consider: Did the technology change how you remember information? How you organize thoughts? What patterns you notice? What relationships you perceive? Ong argues technologies become "interior to consciousness"—can you identify moments when the system became part of how you think rather than just a tool you use?
