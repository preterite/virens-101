## Context

Drawing on Star & Bowker's concept of infrastructure as invisible support systems that become visible when they break, this prompt asks students to make visible what usually remains invisible: the technological and human systems that supported their semester's work. Infrastructure thinking reveals how writing depends on material conditions, social support, routines, and tools that are easy to overlook when functioning smoothly.

## Task

Write two short responses: (1) What digital tools, platforms, and technologies supported your work this semester? (2) What people, spaces, routines, and habits made your work possible? Then in 2-3 sentences, connect these responses by explaining how technological and human infrastructure interacted to enable (or sometimes complicate) your writing.

## Standards

- **[[outcome-workflow-technologies]]**: Identifies technological infrastructure and its effects on writing processes
- **[[outcome-process-documentation]]**: Makes visible the usually-invisible conditions enabling work
- **[[outcome-critical-thinking]]**: Analyzes infrastructure as system rather than just listing tools/people
- **Integration**: Connects technological and human elements rather than treating them separately

## Guidance

For digital infrastructure, consider: word processors, cloud storage, Eli Review, Canvas, Zotero, note-taking apps, devices used, internet access, charging cables, backup systems. For human infrastructure, consider: peers who reviewed work, instructors who provided feedback, family who gave time/space, friends who listened, librarians who helped, routines that created writing time, spaces that supported focus. Where did these systems intersect—technology requiring human interpretation, people depending on platforms, routines structured around tool availability?
