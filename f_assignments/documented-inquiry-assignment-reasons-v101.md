## Design Rationale

The Documented Inquiry serves as a major portfolio component, representing the culmination of research work across Movements 3-4. The assignment reframes traditional research paper structure around inquiry process rather than argumentative thesis, asking students to make research pathways visible, engage sources dialogically, and acknowledge how understanding evolves through reading and thinking. This shift from thesis-driven research to inquiry-based research addresses persistent problems with how first-year students approach source-based writing while maintaining academic rigor appropriate for portfolio assessment.

Three pedagogical goals drive the design:

1. **Genuine inquiry vs. confirmation bias**: Traditional research papers often reinforce confirmation bias—students decide what they believe, then find sources to support those beliefs. Documented inquiry reverses this: students start with questions, engage sources seriously enough to have their thinking changed, and document how understanding evolved.

2. **Visible process vs. polished conclusions**: Academic writing conventions often hide the messy, recursive, uncertain process that leads to knowledge-making. Documented inquiry makes that process visible as pedagogically valuable content, not as weakness to conceal.

3. **Dialogic vs. extractive source use**: Many students treat sources extractively—pulling quotations to support predetermined points without genuinely engaging with what sources actually claim or how they make arguments. Documented inquiry requires dialogic engagement—treating sources as conversation partners whose claims deserve examination and whose limitations warrant acknowledgment.

The assignment builds on Annotated Bibliography work (sources already analyzed through BEAM, patterns already identified) and integrates with other portfolio components (Process Archaeology will analyze the inquiry's composing process, System Map will visualize the research workflow). This integration creates portfolio coherence while avoiding redundancy.

## Theoretical Grounding

### Composition Pedagogy & Research Writing

**Richard Larson's critique of traditional research papers** ("The 'Research Paper' in the Writing Course: A Non-Form of Writing," 1982) provides foundational rationale. Larson argues that the five-paragraph research paper with predetermined thesis is a "non-form"—it doesn't correspond to how scholars actually conduct inquiry or how professionals use research in workplace contexts. Real research emerges from genuine questions, accommodates complexity and contradiction, and often concludes with refined questions rather than definitive answers.

Larson advocates for inquiry-based research assignments where students investigate questions they don't yet know answers to, document how their thinking evolves through engagement with sources and evidence, and conclude honestly about where inquiry has led. Documented inquiry implements Larson's vision: students begin with questions (not theses), trace their thinking as it develops (not hide process), and conclude with refined understanding or new questions (not forced certainty).

**Doug Downs [[@downs2007teaci]] and Elizabeth Wardle's Writing About Writing approach** ("Teaching about Writing, Righting Misconceptions: (Re)Envisioning 'First-Year Composition' as 'Introduction to Writing Studies,'" 2007) emphasizes that composition courses should teach transferable concepts about writing rather than just assigning genres students will write. The concept of "research as inquiry" transfers more effectively than "research as information retrieval." Students who understand research as question-driven, iterative, and dialogic can apply that understanding across disciplines; students who see research as finding-five-sources-and-writing-a-paper struggle when assignments become more complex.

Downs and Wardle also argue for making research processes explicit rather than implicit. Documented inquiry operationalizes this principle—the assignment asks students to narrate research pathways, acknowledge when sources complicated their thinking, and explain how they're using sources (BEAM distinctions). This explicit attention to process builds metalanguage and metacognitive awareness that support transfer.

**Barbara Fister's work on undergraduate research** ("The Research Processes of Undergraduate Students," 1992; "Teaching the Rhetorical Dimensions of Research," 1995) demonstrates that students often approach research as linear information-gathering (find topic → find sources → write paper) rather than recursive inquiry (question → explore → refine question → explore more → synthesize → new questions). Fister argues that assignments should reward rather than penalize this recursion, creating conditions where students can acknowledge uncertainty, follow tangents, and revise understanding.

Documented inquiry creates these conditions by explicitly asking students to make visible their research pathways, including moments when thinking changed or when sources complicated assumptions. Rather than presenting research as smooth progression to predetermined conclusion, the assignment values the actual recursive process that leads to understanding.

### Dialogic Theory

**Gerald Graff's "teaching the conflicts" approach** (*Clueless in Academe*, 2003) informs the assignment's emphasis on engaging source disagreements. Graff argues that academic thinking develops through engaging intellectual conflicts—recognizing where experts disagree, understanding why they disagree, and developing one's own position in relation to disagreement. Students who engage only with sources that agree with each other (or with their predetermined beliefs) miss opportunities for genuine intellectual work.

Documented inquiry requires students to identify where sources conflict, examine why they reach different conclusions (methodological differences, definitional differences, different evidence, different values), and think through implications of these conflicts. This engagement with disagreement creates conditions for genuine analysis—students must think critically about evidence, reasoning, and assumptions rather than just accumulating supporting quotations.

**Bruce Ballenger's work on research as conversation** (*The Curious Researcher*, multiple editions) emphasizes that research writing should position the writer as participant in ongoing scholarly conversations rather than passive reporter of what others have said. Ballenger advocates for research assignments that encourage students to enter conversations by adding their own questions, observations, and analysis—not just summarizing what experts claim.

Documented inquiry implements this conversational framing through dialogic source engagement. Students don't just report "Scholar A says X, Scholar B says Y." They examine *how* scholars make claims, *what* evidence they provide, *why* they might reach different conclusions, and *where* additional inquiry might be productive. This active engagement positions students as legitimate participants in knowledge-making rather than just consumers of expert knowledge.

## Implementation Approach

### Building on Annotated Bibliography

The Documented Inquiry's connection to Annotated Bibliography creates pedagogical continuity:

**BEAM framework foundation**: Students have already analyzed sources through BEAM categories, understanding how sources function as Background, Exhibit, Argument, or Method. This prior analysis makes purposeful source integration more accessible—students can think "I need Argument sources here to show the controversy" or "This Background source establishes context but doesn't advance my inquiry."

**Pattern identification**: The bibliography's synthesis component identified patterns, gaps, and conflicts across sources. These patterns become starting points for inquiry—students can investigate why certain patterns appear, what gaps reveal about current understanding, or how conflicts arise from different approaches or assumptions.

**Source genealogy**: Documentation of how sources were found creates transparency about research pathways that can be explicitly referenced in the inquiry. "Following citations from Source A led me to Source B, which complicated my initial understanding" makes visible the non-linear research process.

This building-on-prior-work demonstrates textual accumulation principles—research doesn't restart with each assignment but develops progressively across Movement 3 and Movement 4.

### Process Visibility Without Excessive Narration

The assignment asks students to make research pathways visible but doesn't require exhaustive process narrative. The distinction matters pedagogically:

**Process visibility** means acknowledging key moments: when assumptions changed, when sources conflicted in illuminating ways, when questions became more refined, when methodological differences explained apparent contradictions. These moments demonstrate intellectual honesty and show thinking as dynamic.

**Excessive narration** would involve reporting every database search, every source read, every decision made. This chronological reporting often adds length without insight and can distract from the inquiry's substantive content.

The guidance provides examples of concise process acknowledgment: "Initially I assumed X, but Source A's evidence suggested Y" or "Sources B and C reach opposite conclusions because they define the key term differently." These brief acknowledgments make process visible without drowning the inquiry in meta-commentary.

### Peer Review with Evaluative Protocol

The Week 12 peer review uses evaluative protocol (DES: Describe-Evaluate-Suggest [[@elireview2025givi]]) because Documented Inquiry is advanced analytical work with clear criteria:
- Is the inquiry focused on a genuine question?
- Are sources integrated dialogically or just summarized?
- Is the research pathway visible without excessive narration?
- Are BEAM distinctions used purposefully?
- Does the piece conclude honestly rather than forcing certainty?

Evaluative feedback helps students strengthen work that will appear in their portfolio, providing directive suggestions about where analysis needs depth, where source engagement needs development, where organization needs clarity. The generous protocol used for earlier personal/exploratory work wouldn't provide the targeted feedback that advanced research writing requires.

## Competing Values & Tradeoffs

### Inquiry vs. Argument

**Tension**: Some composition theory emphasizes argumentation—making claims and supporting them with evidence. Does documented inquiry's emphasis on questions and process shortchange argumentative writing instruction?

**Resolution**: Documented inquiry doesn't eliminate argumentation; it situates argument within inquiry. Students still make claims about sources (analyzing their evidence, examining their reasoning, identifying their limitations), about patterns (explaining why sources cluster in certain ways), and about implications (suggesting what conflicts or gaps reveal). The difference is that claims emerge from inquiry rather than being predetermined, and conclusions acknowledge uncertainty or complexity rather than forcing definitive statements.

This approach better prepares students for advanced academic writing where "argument" often means "well-reasoned inquiry-based analysis" rather than "thesis and support." Documented inquiry teaches argumentative thinking while avoiding the five-paragraph formula that students often over-apply.

### Length Requirements: 1800-2500 Words

**Tension**: This range is substantial—longer than many traditional first-year research papers (1200-1500 words). Does the length create unnecessary burden?

**Resolution**: The length accommodates the work the assignment asks students to do: introduce the inquiry question with context, engage 6-10 sources dialogically (not just summarily), make research pathway visible, and conclude thoughtfully. Shorter length would force superficial source engagement—students couldn't examine claims and evidence in enough detail to demonstrate genuine analysis.

The length also reflects portfolio standards—this is summative work representing students' best research writing. The preparatory fragment (inquiry planning) and peer review cycle provide scaffolding so students aren't drafting 2000+ words without support.

### Documented Inquiry vs. Traditional Research Paper

**Tension**: Many stakeholders (students, parents, future instructors) expect first-year composition to teach "research papers." Does documented inquiry provide this expected instruction?

**Resolution**: Documented inquiry *is* a research paper—it requires library research, source analysis, integration, citation, organization, and argumentation. The difference is pedagogical framing (inquiry-driven rather than thesis-driven) and process emphasis (making pathways visible rather than hiding them). These differences improve learning outcomes while meeting stakeholder expectations for research instruction.

The assignment also prepares students for disciplinary research writing better than formulaic five-paragraph research papers. In most disciplines, research involves investigating questions, engaging competing perspectives, acknowledging limitations, and suggesting implications—exactly what documented inquiry teaches. The traditional research paper formula is often an artificial composition genre that doesn't transfer to disciplinary writing.

## Evidence & Iteration

### Evidence to Collect

- [ ] **Inquiry focus**: Do students investigate genuine questions, or revert to thesis-driven arguments?
- [ ] **Source engagement quality**: Do students engage sources dialogically (examining claims/evidence), or just summarily (reporting what sources say)?
- [ ] **Process visibility**: Do students make research pathways visible concisely, or either hide process entirely or over-narrate?
- [ ] **BEAM integration**: Do students use BEAM distinctions purposefully, or treat all sources equivalently?
- [ ] **Conclusion honesty**: Do conclusions acknowledge complexity/uncertainty, or force artificial certainty?
- [ ] **Integration with bibliography**: Do documented inquiries build clearly on annotated bibliography work, or start from scratch?
- [ ] **Portfolio quality**: How does documented inquiry compare to other portfolio components in polish, depth, and coherence?

### Revision Notes

**First-pilot questions**:
- Is 1800-2500 words the right range, or should it be shorter (1500-2000) or longer (2000-3000)?
- Do students understand "documented inquiry" as distinct from "research paper," or is terminology confusing?
- Is one peer review cycle (Week 12) sufficient, or would earlier review help?
- Does the inquiry planning fragment (preparatory work) provide enough scaffolding?
- Are students successfully using BEAM to integrate sources, or reverting to generic "Scholar says..."?
