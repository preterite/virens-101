## Design Rationale

The Annotated Bibliography functions as Movement 3's milestone (50 points, due Week 11), transforming a traditional composition genre by integrating BEAM framework analysis, source genealogy documentation, and synthetic framing. Rather than treating the annotated bibliography as a preliminary exercise before "real" research writing, this assignment positions bibliography creation as intellectual work in its own right—curating sources requires analytical thinking, recognizing rhetorical uses of sources demands close reading, and synthesizing across sources creates genuine knowledge-making opportunities.

This design addresses three persistent problems with traditional annotated bibliographies in composition:

1. **Summary-heavy compliance**: Students often produce bibliographies that summarize sources without analyzing how those sources might be used or how they relate to each other. The result feels like a box-checking exercise rather than genuine research practice.

2. **Invisible research processes**: Traditional bibliographies present sources as finished lists without revealing how researchers found sources, followed citation trails, or made decisions about inclusion/exclusion. This invisibility reinforces the myth that research is straightforward discovery rather than iterative, often serendipitous pathway-building.

3. **Disconnection from writing**: When bibliographies are treated as preliminary exercises, students struggle to integrate sources purposefully in subsequent research writing. They've summarized sources but haven't thought about rhetorical use, so they end up plugging in quotations to meet requirements rather than using sources to build arguments.

The BEAM-integrated bibliography with genealogy and synthesis addresses these problems systematically: BEAM analysis moves beyond summary to rhetorical function, genealogy makes research pathways visible, and synthesis creates connections that prepare for integrated source use in Documented Inquiry.

## Theoretical Grounding

### Composition Pedagogy & Research Writing

**Joseph Bizup's BEAM framework** ("BEAM: A Rhetorical Vocabulary for Teaching Research-Based Writing," 2008) provides the assignment's analytical foundation. Bizup argues that composition instruction typically categorizes sources by type (primary/secondary, scholarly/popular, books/articles) rather than by rhetorical use. This type-based categorization doesn't help students understand *how* to use sources—knowing that something is a scholarly article doesn't tell you whether to use it as Background (establishing context), Exhibit (providing data to analyze), Argument (making claims to engage), or Method (demonstrating approaches).

BEAM reframes source categorization functionally: Background sources establish what's generally accepted or provide necessary context; Exhibit sources offer data, examples, or texts to analyze; Argument sources make claims the writer agrees with, extends, or disputes; Method sources demonstrate analytical frameworks or research approaches to adopt. Importantly, the same source can function in multiple ways—a psychology article might provide Background about current understanding and serve as Exhibit when you analyze its methodology.

This functional approach helps students develop what Bizup calls "rhetorical intelligence" about sources—recognizing that source use is a strategic choice matching purpose and context. The annotated bibliography implements BEAM by requiring students to tag each source, making rhetorical function explicit rather than implicit.

**Rebecca Moore Howard and Sandra Jamieson's Citation Project research** demonstrates why BEAM analysis matters pedagogically. Their large-scale study of how students use sources ("The Citation Project: Preventing Plagiarism, Teaching Writing," 2010-present) found that students often struggle not with finding sources but with integrating them purposefully. Students tend to use sources primarily as Background (establishing context) and rarely engage with sources as Argument (making claims to dispute or extend). This pattern suggests that students haven't developed frameworks for thinking about how sources can function rhetorically.

BEAM provides that framework. By analyzing sources through BEAM categories during bibliography creation, students practice recognizing different rhetorical possibilities before they start drafting research writing. This preparation makes integration more purposeful—students can think "I need an Argument source to complicate this claim" or "This Exhibit source would work better as evidence here than that Background source."

**Mariolina Salvatori's [[@salvatori1996conve]] work on difficulty and reading** ("Conversations with Texts: Reading in the Teaching of Composition," 1996) informs the synthesis component. Salvatori argues that productive reading involves recognizing where sources disagree, where claims seem questionable, where evidence doesn't quite support conclusions—treating difficulty as generative rather than something to smooth over. The synthesis requirement operationalizes this approach: students must identify patterns but also conflicts, gaps, and complications across sources. This analytical work prevents bibliographies from becoming just summaries and creates foundation for the Documented Inquiry, where students will navigate source conflicts explicitly.

### Information Literacy

**Alison Head and Michael Eisenberg's Project Information Literacy research** ("Truth Be Told: How College Students Evaluate and Use Information in the Digital Age," 2010) demonstrates that students often follow linear research pathways—Google search → first acceptable source → done. This efficiency-seeking approach misses how expert researchers actually work: following citation trails, browsing journal issues, exploring tangential leads, asking librarians for suggestions, returning to early sources with new understanding.

The source genealogy requirement makes non-linear research pathways visible and valued. By documenting how they found each source (database search terms, citation following, recommendation, serendipity), students create maps of their research processes that reveal research as pathway-building rather than just answer-finding. This documentation also serves practical purposes: when students need additional sources later, they can retrace productive pathways rather than starting from scratch.

**Richard Larson's work on research as process** ("The 'Research Paper' in the Writing Course: A Non-Form of Writing," 1982) critiques traditional research paper assignments for treating research as information-gathering rather than inquiry-driven thinking. Larson argues that research writing should emerge from genuine questions, not predetermined thesis statements. The research questions component implements Larson's insight: rather than starting with answers and finding supporting sources, students engage with sources and let questions emerge from what they discover. The questions asked at bibliography stage may differ from initial curiosity questions because sources have complicated, refined, or redirected thinking.

## Implementation Approach

### Progressive Development Through Fragments

The three preparatory fragments create scaffolded progression:

**BEAM Source Entry #1 (Week 8)**: Students analyze one source using BEAM framework, learning the tagging system and source genealogy documentation with single example. This focused practice builds skill before scaling to full bibliography.

**BEAM Source Entry #2 (Week 9)**: Students add another source, now comparing two sources and noticing potential patterns or conflicts. The peer review (Cycle 4, evaluative protocol) provides feedback on BEAM accuracy and analytical depth.

**Portfolio Framing (Week 10)**: Students draft introduction and synthesis for their growing collection (now 5-6 sources minimum). This framing work helps them articulate why the collection matters and what patterns they're seeing. Peer review (Cycle 5, generous protocol) helps clarify the framing.

**Full Bibliography (Week 11)**: Students expand to 8-12 sources and polish all components. By this point, they've practiced BEAM tagging multiple times, received feedback on entries and framing, and understand how the pieces fit together.

This progression demonstrates textual accumulation—each fragment builds toward the complete bibliography rather than being separate work. Students who engage seriously with fragmentary development have most of the bibliography complete before the Week 11 deadline; they're polishing and extending rather than drafting from scratch.

### Two Peer Review Cycles with Different Protocols

**Week 9 (Cycle 4)**: Evaluative protocol (DES) for source entries makes sense because BEAM tagging has right/wrong dimensions—sources either are or aren't being used as Background, Exhibit, Argument, or Method. Evaluative feedback helps students refine their analytical accuracy.

**Week 10 (Cycle 5)**: Generous protocol (SPQ) for framing components makes sense because introduction and synthesis are more open-ended. There's no single correct way to frame a source collection or synthesize patterns. Reader response about what's clear, what's interesting, and what needs development serves better than evaluative judgment.

This protocol shift also reinforces that different components of the same assignment may need different feedback approaches—a lesson in rhetorical awareness applicable beyond this course.

### BEAM as Transferable Framework

BEAM transfers across writing contexts better than many composition concepts because it describes functional relationships between sources and writing purposes rather than discipline-specific conventions. A biology student can use BEAM to analyze lab reports (Method sources demonstrating protocols, Exhibit sources providing data, Argument sources making claims about mechanisms). A literature student can use BEAM to recognize when they're using a novel as Exhibit (text to analyze) versus Background (contextual information about the period). A business student can use BEAM to distinguish between Background sources (industry reports) and Argument sources (strategy recommendations).

This transferability serves first-year composition goals: students need portable frameworks applicable across their academic work, not just skills for English class. BEAM provides that portability while remaining sophisticated enough to support genuine analytical work.

## Competing Values & Tradeoffs

### BEAM Complexity vs. Traditional Simplicity

**Tension**: Traditional annotated bibliographies (summary + evaluation for each source) are simpler to execute than BEAM-integrated versions. Does the added complexity serve learning or just increase difficulty without proportionate benefit?

**Resolution**: The complexity serves pedagogical purposes that simpler versions don't achieve. BEAM analysis requires students to think about rhetorical use—not just "what does this source say?" but "how am I using it in my thinking?" This meta-level awareness prepares for purposeful source integration in research writing. Without BEAM (or similar framework), students often struggle to move beyond summary-quote-summary patterns because they haven't practiced thinking about sources functionally.

The scaffolding through fragments also manages complexity. Students learn BEAM with single sources before applying it to full bibliographies, and peer review provides feedback on accuracy before final submission.

### Source Number: Depth vs. Breadth

**Tension**: Requiring 8-12 sources creates breadth but might sacrifice depth of engagement with individual sources. Would fewer sources with deeper analysis work better?

**Resolution**: Eight to twelve sources represents realistic corpus size for undergraduate research projects—substantial enough to show engagement with scholarly conversation but manageable enough to analyze deeply. Fewer sources (4-5) risks creating too-simple narratives about topics; more sources (15+) becomes overwhelming for first-year students still developing research skills.

The 150-200 words per entry range also balances breadth and depth: substantial enough for genuine analysis (not just one-sentence summaries) but concise enough to maintain focus. Students who want to engage more deeply with particular sources can do so in Documented Inquiry, where they'll integrate subset of bibliography sources.

### Bibliography as Milestone vs. Preparation

**Tension**: Is the bibliography an end in itself (milestone worth 50 points) or preparation for Documented Inquiry (where sources get used in integrated writing)? These purposes might pull in different directions.

**Resolution**: The bibliography serves both purposes without conflict. As milestone, it demonstrates research skills, analytical thinking, and information literacy—valuable outcomes whether or not every source appears in subsequent writing. As preparation, it creates curated resource and analytical foundation for Documented Inquiry. Students who complete strong bibliographies have easier time with Documented Inquiry because they've already analyzed sources and identified patterns; students who treat bibliography as compliance hurdle struggle later.

The point distribution (30 points for entries, 20 points for framing/synthesis/questions) emphasizes that individual source work and collective synthesis both matter—supporting both milestone and preparation functions.

## Evidence & Iteration

### Evidence to Collect

- [ ] **BEAM accuracy**: Do students accurately tag sources, or do they default to "Background" for everything? (This reveals whether BEAM framework is learnable or confusing.)
- [ ] **Source diversity**: Do bibliographies include varied source types (scholarly articles, books, primary sources, multimedia) and BEAM categories?
- [ ] **Genealogy specificity**: Do students document research pathways with detail, or provide generic statements like "found through Google"?
- [ ] **Synthesis quality**: Do syntheses identify genuine patterns and conflicts, or just restate that sources exist?
- [ ] **Research question sophistication**: Do questions emerge from source engagement (showing thinking has evolved), or restate initial curiosity questions unchanged?
- [ ] **Integration in Documented Inquiry**: Do students draw effectively on bibliography sources when composing Documented Inquiry, or start from scratch despite having curated collection?
- [ ] **Student reflections**: Process Archaeology and M3 reflections may reveal whether students found BEAM framework useful or frustrating.

### Revision Notes

**First-pilot questions**:
- Is 8-12 sources the right range, or should it be narrower (8-10) or allow more flexibility?
- Are 150-200 words per entry sufficient for BEAM analysis plus genealogy plus summary, or does this feel cramped?
- Do students understand BEAM categories well enough after library session and fragment practice, or do they need more instruction?
- Is source genealogy documentation valuable enough to justify space it takes in entries, or does it feel like busywork?
- Do synthesis patterns emerge across student bibliographies that could inform future instruction?
