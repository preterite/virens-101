## Synthesis

We open Movement 2 by naming something you've already been doing. Every fragment you've produced over the past three weeks—whether a meditation on Ong's claims about consciousness or an observation captured on campus—has been rhetorical. You've been making choices about what to include, how to arrange it, whom you imagine encountering it. You've been practicing rhetoric without calling it that. This week we name the practice, and in naming it, gain leverage.

The word "rhetoric" carries baggage in contemporary discourse: we speak of "mere rhetoric" or "empty rhetoric" to dismiss speech as manipulative, hollow, performance without substance. But that dismissal is itself a rhetorical move—an attempt to claim the high ground of authenticity against an opponent's supposed artifice. Let's bracket that dismissal and recover what rhetoric meant before it became a term of abuse.

Picture Cicero in 63 BCE, standing before the Senate in the Temple of Jupiter Stator. Catiline, accused of conspiracy, sits isolated—his fellow senators have cleared the benches around him. Cicero begins: _"Quo usque tandem abutere, Catilina, patientia nostra?"_—"How long, Catiline, will you abuse our patience?" This is rhetoric in its classical glory: urgent speech aimed at moving specific people to specific action, bounded by occasion and context, deploying every available means of persuasion. Cicero understood something essential: language is an _interface_ between human minds, and working that interface skillfully is what distinguishes civic participation from mere noise.

The ancients figured this interface through the image of the closed fist and the open hand. _Ratio_—tight, compressed reasoning—is the closed fist: logic, argument, demonstration. _Eloquentia_—flowing, expressive language—is the open hand: style, persuasion, connection. A skilled rhetor deploys both, adjusting the balance to situation and audience. This pairing matters because it preserves a crucial distinction: persuasion differs from coercion precisely in requiring the audience's willing assent. Rhetoric operates through reasons offered, not force applied. Agency—yours and your audience's—is always at stake.

Modern representations systematize these intuitions into the "rhetorical triangle": rhetor, audience, message, often bounded by a circle representing context. Popular pedagogy maps rhetorical appeals onto this structure: _pathos_ (emotional appeal) aligns with audience and their feelings; _kairos_ (timeliness) aligns with context and its constraints; _ethos_ (credibility) aligns with the rhetor and their perceived character; _logos_ (reasoning) aligns with the message and its internal coherence. The mapping oversimplifies—all appeals work simultaneously on all elements—but it provides useful vocabulary for analysis.

The ancients also classified rhetoric by temporal orientation and purpose. _Forensic_ rhetoric argues about the past: courtroom disputes over what happened. _Deliberative_ rhetoric argues about the future: political assemblies debating what should be done. _Epideictic_ rhetoric operates in the present: ceremonial speeches praising the good and blaming the bad, shaping the community's values. Your Literacy Narrative, due at week's end, has operated primarily in forensic mode—reconstructing your history with writing. The source-based work we begin this week shifts toward deliberative: what claims should we make, what positions should we take, what arguments bear constructing?

Ong, whose work on orality and literacy anchored Movement 1, later argued that writers always invent their audiences. In "The Writer's Audience Is Always a Fiction," he observes that unlike speakers who face present hearers, writers project imagined readers—and readers, reciprocally, imagine absent authors. Every text is a mutual fiction: a writer imagining who might read, a reader imagining who might have written. This insight matters for source-based work. When you quote a scholar, you're not merely extracting information—you're entering a relationship with an absent person whose presence must be constructed through your prose.

Later rhetoricians systematized the process of construction into the _rhetorical canons_: invention (generating material), arrangement (structuring it), style (expressing it), memory (retaining it), delivery (presenting it). These five canons map surprisingly well onto our six-move framework. Capture and classify are invention work—generating and sorting raw material. Route and distill are arrangement and style—deciding where things go and how to compress them. Connect is a memory operation—linking new material to what you already know. Publish is delivery—preparing material for others to encounter. The ancients knew what we're operationalizing: rhetoric isn't magic, it's process.

This week introduces SEAR as a sentence-level mechanic for integrating sources into your prose. SEAR stands for Situate, Embed, Analyze, Relate—a mnemonic for what goes where when you work with quotations. _Situate_ the source: who's speaking, from what position, why should we listen? _Embed_ the material: make it part of your sentence, grammatically integrated. _Analyze_ what you've embedded: don't let the source speak for itself. _Relate_ the analysis to your larger purpose: so what, why does this matter here? SEAR is a small constraint with outsized effects. It prevents the common failure mode of quotation-dumping—dropping sources into paragraphs without context or follow-through. It operationalizes rhetoric at the sentence level.

The prompt available this week—"What Happens After You Submit?"—extends our materiality conversation into questions of circulation. Where does your writing go once it enters digital systems? How do fragments of your textual self circulate through platforms, algorithms, institutional records? This connects rhetoric to infrastructure: the interfaces we work through aren't just stylistic choices but material systems with their own logics of storage, retrieval, and circulation. Citation systems—which you'll learn to use more formally in Week 5 with Zotero—sit at the intersection of human-readable rhetoric (SEAR's work) and machine-parseable metadata (what databases and algorithms read). A citation is both a signal to human readers and a vector traversable by systems.

By week's end, your Literacy Narrative reaches its first formal audience: your peers in Eli Review next week, then your instructor. The transition from Movement 1's expansive capture to Movement 2's named engagement is also a transition from writing primarily for yourself (getting material down) to writing for others (making material readable). Rhetoric, it turns out, is the art of that transition.

## Reading

**This Week**: [[downs-rhetoric-reading-course-v101|Downs, "Rhetoric: Making Sense of Human Interaction and Meaning-Making"]] (~20 pages)

**Key Concepts**: Rhetorical situation, rhetorical appeals (ethos/pathos/logos/kairos), rhetorical triangle, audience awareness, history of rhetoric

**Connection to Activities**: Downs provides vocabulary for naming what students have been doing intuitively. The reading's taxonomy supports Block 6's instructor synthesis on rhetoric and grounds the week's source-based writing practice.

**Reading Approach**: This is a schematic, summarizing reading—designed as an accessible introduction rather than a difficult theoretical text. Read for vocabulary acquisition: what terms does Downs offer, and how do they help you describe your own writing choices?

### Block Details

#### Block 1: SEAR Introduction and Source-Based Writing

**Type**: W

**Duration**: 25 minutes

**Materials**: Downs reading (completed as homework), SEAR handout (reference copy), quotations students want to work with

**Opening** (5 min): Introduce SEAR as a mnemonic for source integration. Write on board:
- **S**ituate: Who's speaking? From what position? Why listen?
- **E**mbed: Make it part of your sentence grammatically
- **A**nalyze: Don't let the source speak for itself
- **R**elate: So what? Why does this matter here?

Emphasize: SEAR is a mechanic, not a formula. It answers "what goes where" at the sentence level.

**Main Activity** (15 min): Students select a quotation from Downs (or from earlier readings if preferred) and write a SEAR paragraph. The quotation should be something they want to dig into—something that puzzled, provoked, or confirmed their thinking.

**Closing** (5 min): Write-pair-share. Students read their SEAR paragraph to a partner; partners identify which element (S, E, A, or R) feels strongest and which needs development.

**Connection**: Introduces [[vocab-SEAR-procedure]] and supports [[outcome-rhetorical-awareness]]. This is the first explicit instruction in source integration; it prepares for more formal citation work in Week 5.

**Note**: SEAR handout needs development. For this session, board notes suffice; handout provides reference for future work.

---

#### Block 2: Source-Based Fragment Development

**Type**: W

**Duration**: 25 minutes

**Materials**: Downs reading, students' SEAR work from Block 1, fragment collection

**Opening** (3 min): Brief framing: "You've practiced SEAR once. Now extend that work into a full fragment. Your goal is ![[_def-fragment-wordcount-range]] that puts a source in conversation with your own thinking."

**Main Activity** (18 min): Sustained writing. Students develop their Block 1 SEAR paragraph into a complete fragment, or begin a new source-based fragment responding to a different passage from Downs. Encourage them to think about what Downs's vocabulary helps them _see_ that they couldn't see before.

**Closing** (4 min): Quick self-assessment: "On a scale of 1-5, how confident do you feel about the 'Analyze' move? The 'Relate' move?" Brief discussion of which moves feel harder.

**Connection**: Builds [[outcome-textual-accumulation]] through continued fragment production. First source-based fragments join the corpus alongside personal/observational fragments from M1.

---

#### Block 3: In-Class Peer Feedback on Source-Based Fragments

**Type**: P

**Duration**: 25 minutes

**Materials**: Students' source-based fragments from Blocks 1-2, Prompt 4.3 (available)

**Opening** (3 min): Frame peer feedback as low-stakes practice before formal Eli Review next week. Focus question: "Can you identify the SEAR moves in your partner's fragment? Which move does the most work? Which needs more development?"

**Main Activity** (17 min): Pair exchange. Each student reads partner's fragment and annotates (on paper or verbally) where they see Situate, Embed, Analyze, Relate happening. Then 3-4 minutes of verbal feedback per pair.

**Closing** (5 min): Introduce Prompt 4.3 ("What Happens After You Submit?") as an option for continued fragment work. Brief preview: this prompt extends our materiality conversation to questions of circulation—where does writing go after you release it?

**Connection**: Informal peer review prepares for [[peer-review-cycle1-literacy-narrative-criteria-course-v101]] next week. The prompt extends [[outcome-workflow-technologies]] by connecting rhetoric to infrastructure.

---

#### Block 4: Revise Literacy Narrative for Submission

**Type**: R

**Duration**: 25 minutes

**Materials**: Literacy Narrative drafts (from Week 3), peer feedback from Week 3 Block 4, Prompt 3.5 responses if completed

**Opening** (3 min): Frame this as final revision before the Literacy Narrative enters formal circulation (peer review next week, instructor feedback this week). Ask: "What one thing do you most want to improve before this draft meets readers?"

**Main Activity** (20 min): Sustained revision. Students work on their Literacy Narratives with specific revision goals. Encourage them to read aloud (quietly) to catch sentence-level issues.

**Closing** (2 min): Reminder: Literacy Narrative draft due end of week. It doesn't need to be perfect—it needs to be ready for feedback.

**Connection**: Completes M1 work on [[outcome-composing-processes]]. The Literacy Narrative represents students' first extended, polished piece—forensic rhetoric reconstructing their writing history.

---

#### Block 5: Continue Source-Based Writing

**Type**: W

**Duration**: 25 minutes

**Materials**: Downs reading, prior course readings, fragment collection

**Opening** (2 min): Brief prompt: "You have 20+ minutes of writing time. You might continue developing a source-based fragment, start a new one responding to a different passage, or work on Prompt 4.3. Your choice—but keep SEAR in mind."

**Main Activity** (21 min): Sustained writing. Instructor circulates, available for questions about SEAR application or source selection.

**Closing** (2 min): Fragment count check-in: "How many fragments do you have now? M1 target was 8-12; we're building toward 20-28 by end of M2."

**Connection**: Continues [[outcome-textual-accumulation]]. Multiple writing blocks this week reflect M2's balanced W/P/R character—still generating, but now with source engagement.

---

#### Block 6: Instructor Synthesis on Rhetoric and Feedback

**Type**: I

**Duration**: 25 minutes

**Materials**: Downs reading, student Literacy Narratives (submitted or in progress)

**Opening** (2 min): Frame: "I want to synthesize what Downs offers with what we've been doing all week—and all semester. Then I'll share feedback on your Literacy Narratives."

**Main Activity—Rhetoric Synthesis** (12-15 min): Instructor mini-lecture connecting:
- Downs's taxonomy to the week's SEAR practice
- Rhetorical canons (invention, arrangement, style, memory, delivery) to six-move framework
- Ancient rhetorical purposes (forensic, deliberative, epideictic) to course assignments
- The rhetorical triangle to source-based writing (you're now in relationship with absent authors)

**Main Activity—Feedback** (8-10 min): General patterns observed in Literacy Narratives. What's working across the cohort? What common challenges appear? Individual written feedback will follow via Canvas/email.

**Closing** (2 min): Preview Week 5: Zotero introduction (formal citation tools), Eli Review Cycle 1 on Literacy Narratives, Meadows reading on leverage points.

**Connection**: Synthesizes [[outcome-rhetorical-awareness]] with [[outcome-composing-processes]]. Models how theoretical vocabulary (Downs) illuminates practical work (fragments, SEAR, Literacy Narrative).

## Instructor Notes

### Facilitation Tips

- **Block 1 (SEAR)**: Keep the introduction brief and practical. SEAR is a mnemonic, not a philosophy—students should be writing within 5 minutes. The write-pair-share at the end surfaces which moves feel natural vs. difficult.

- **Block 3 (Peer Feedback)**: This is low-stakes practice. Emphasize that students are learning to _give_ feedback as much as receive it. Next week's Eli Review will formalize the process.

- **Block 6 (Synthesis)**: This is your chance to connect Downs's taxonomy to the larger course arc. The rhetorical canons → six-move mapping is generative; don't rush it. Students benefit from seeing that ancient rhetoricians systematized the same processes we're operationalizing.

### Flexibility Points

- **Block 5** can shift to additional peer feedback if students need more practice before Eli Review.
- **Prompt 4.3** is available but not required this week; some students may prefer to focus on SEAR practice with Downs before tackling the circulation prompt.
- **SEAR depth**: If students struggle, Block 2 can include additional modeling before independent practice.

### Common Challenges

- **"Analyze" move**: Students often embed quotations but then move directly to "Relate" without analyzing. Watch for this pattern; it's the most common SEAR failure.
- **Source selection**: Some students choose quotations that are too long or too abstract to work with productively. Encourage short, specific passages.
- **M1→M2 transition anxiety**: Some students find the shift from personal writing to source-based writing disorienting. Reassure them that SEAR is a small mechanic, not a whole new mode of writing.

### Evidence to Collect

- Are students identifying SEAR moves in peer work accurately? (Block 3)
- Which SEAR move do students report as most difficult? (Block 2 closing)
- How many source-based fragments are students producing? (Block 5 check-in)
- What patterns appear in Literacy Narratives? (Block 6 feedback prep)
