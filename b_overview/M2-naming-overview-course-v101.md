# Movement 2: Naming (Weeks 4-7)

## Movement Overview

**Core Question**: How do you classify, organize, and route the material you've accumulated? What systems help you work with sources and structure feedback?

**Metaphor**: Classifying and routing. In Movement 2, you're learning to name what you have—to sort fragments by type, categorize sources by function, and create systems that help you find and connect related pieces. You're also entering structured feedback cycles, learning to give and receive useful comments.

**Duration**: 4 weeks (Weeks 4-7) | ~22 blocks

**Mode Emphasis**: Balanced W-P-R cycling (writing, peer review, revision working together)

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of Movement 2, you will be able to:

- **Classify writing** by type and purpose using frameworks like BEAM (Background, Exhibit, Argument, Method)
- **Engage with sources systematically** using citation tools and structured reading practices (SEAR: Situate, Embed, Analyze, Relate)
- **Give and receive substantive peer feedback** through Eli Review cycles
- **Route material** to appropriate locations using your organizational systems
- **Work with constraints deliberately** by analyzing how requirements shape what you write
- **Build your corpus** to 20-28 fragments by end of Week 7
- **Document your process** through regular dev log entries

**Key Principle Introduced**: **Constraint Sequencing**—*When* constraints arrive matters as much as *what* they are. You'll experience adding constraints deliberately and observe how each changes your writing.

---

## What You'll Be Doing

### Week-by-Week Focus

| Week | Primary Activity | Milestone |
|------|-------|-----------|
| **Week 4** | Source-based writing begins; prepare for Zotero | Informal peer feedback practice |
| **Week 5** | Zotero library session (T3-T4); first graded Eli cycle | Begin formal citation work |
| **Week 6** | Spec Document development; second Eli cycle | Practice constraint specification |
| **Week 7** | Constraint Audit; BEAM tagging practice | Complete Spec Document + Constraint Audit |

### Typical Week Structure

Movement 2 introduces the **W-P-R cycle**—writing, peer review, revision working together:

**Example week pattern**:
- **Blocks 1-2** (50 min): Writing (W) — Generate new fragments or develop drafts
- **Blocks 3-4** (50 min): Peer Review (P) or Writing (W) — Give/receive feedback
- **Blocks 5-6** (50 min): Revision (R) — Process feedback and revise

**Homework**: Reading (40-60 pages/week) + fragment work + Eli Review assignments

## Key Activities & Assignments

### Source-Based Writing (Weeks 4-7)

In Movement 2, you shift from writing primarily from experience (M1) to writing *with* and *about* sources. You'll respond to course readings, integrate quotations, and learn formal citation practices.

**New tool**: **Zotero** (citation management)—introduced Week 5 during library session. This tool helps you collect, organize, and cite sources.

**Before Zotero** (Week 4): You'll write with sources using whatever citation habits you currently have. This creates a "before" baseline so you can see what changes when formal tools arrive.

**After Zotero** (Weeks 5-7): You'll practice structured citation, learning to see citations as more than just formatting—they're links, pointers, dependencies, relationships.

### Spec Document (Due Week 7)

**Assignment**: Write a specification document for a writing project—*before* drafting the project itself.

**What is a spec document?** A pre-drafting document that specifies intention, constraints, audience, purpose, and success criteria. It's borrowed from software development, where teams write specs before coding.

**Purpose**: 
- Make your intentions explicit
- Clarify scope and constraints
- Create a standard to measure against later
- Separate *planning* from *executing*

**Format**: 500-800 words addressing:
- Purpose: What does this text need to accomplish?
- Audience: Who will read this? What do they need?
- Constraints: What are the requirements/limits?
- Success criteria: How will you know if this works?
- Scope: What's in? What's out?

**Assessment**: 50 points (Movement 2 milestone, combined with Constraint Audit)

### Constraint Audit (Due Week 7)

**Assignment**: Analyze how *constraints shape writing*. Take a piece of writing (yours or published) and identify:
- Explicit constraints (length, format, audience, genre requirements)
- Implicit constraints (assumptions, conventions, unstated rules)
- How the text would change if constraints changed

**Purpose**: This is a rhetorical analysis assignment, but reframed. Instead of asking "how does this text work rhetorically?", you're asking "what constraints shaped this text, and how?"

**Format**: 800-1000 words + annotated example

**Assessment**: 50 points (Movement 2 milestone, combined with Spec Document)

**Connection to course principles**: Learning to see constraints as *variables*—things that can be adjusted, sequenced, negotiated—rather than fixed rules.

### Structured Peer Feedback: Eli Review (Weeks 5-7)

Movement 2 introduces **graded Eli Review cycles** (you familiarized with Eli in Week 2, but that was ungraded practice).

**How it works**:
1. Submit a draft to Eli Review
2. Get assigned 2-3 peer drafts to review
3. Write feedback guided by prompts/criteria
4. Receive feedback from 2-3 peers
5. Rate the helpfulness of feedback you received
6. Write a revision plan based on feedback

**Why Eli Review?** 
- Anonymized feedback reduces personal awkwardness
- Helpfulness ratings let you partner with helpful reviewers over time
- Structured prompts guide substantive feedback (not just "good job!")
- Revision planning makes feedback actionable

**Grading**: Peer review work is worth 200 points total across the semester (6 cycles @ 40 points each; lowest 1 dropped).

## Six Moves Vocabulary: Classify & Route

Movement 2 focuses on two new moves: **Classify** and **Route**.

**Classify** = Identify what type of material this is  
**Route** = Send it to appropriate location

**What it looks like**:
- Tagging fragments by topic or type
- Sorting index cards into categories
- Using BEAM tags to classify sources (Background/Exhibit/Argument/Method)
- Determining which folder a fragment belongs in
- Deciding what kind of writing this fragment should become

**Why it matters**: You can't work efficiently with accumulated material unless you can find and group related pieces. Classification systems are tools for navigating your own corpus.

**Moves you've learned**: Capture (M1)  
**Moves you'll learn**: Distill (M3), Connect (M3), Publish (M4)

---

## Source Engagement: BEAM & SEAR

### BEAM: Classifying Sources

**BEAM** (Background, Exhibit, Argument, Method) is a taxonomy for *how sources function* in your writing, developed by Joseph Bizup:

- **B**ackground: Sources that provide context, definitions, general knowledge
- **E**xhibit: Sources you analyze as evidence (primary sources, examples, cases)
- **A**rgument: Sources whose claims you agree/disagree with or build on
- **M**ethod: Sources that provide frameworks, theories, or methodological approaches

**Practice**: As you accumulate sources in Zotero, tag them with BEAM categories. Notice how the same source might function differently in different projects.

### SEAR: Working with Sources

**SEAR** (Situate, Embed, Analyze, Relate) is a procedure for integrating sources into your writing:

1. **Situate**: Who wrote this? When? In what context?
2. **Embed**: Quote or paraphrase the specific passage
3. **Analyze**: What does this passage mean? What's significant about it?
4. **Relate**: How does this connect to your claim/argument?

**Practice**: Use SEAR when writing source-based fragments. This keeps you from "drive-by quotation" (dropping quotes without analysis) and "hanging quotations" (quotes not connected to surrounding text).

---

## Fragment Target Trajectory

By end of M2 (Week 7): **20-28 fragments total** (12-16 new fragments in M2)

**Production rate in M2**: 3-4 fragments per week continues, but now fragments are increasingly source-based. You're learning to generate material *in conversation with* readings, not just from personal experience.

**Quality shift**: M2 fragments should include citations, demonstrate engagement with sources, and show awareness of constraints. They're still drafts, but more structured drafts.

---

## Technology & Organization

### Week 5: Zotero Library Session (T3-T4)

**Block 1 (T3)**: Zotero basics
- Installing the Zotero desktop app and browser connector
- Adding sources to your library
- Creating collections (folders)
- Adding notes and tags

**Block 2 (T4)**: Zotero practice
- Adding sources from course readings
- Tagging with BEAM categories
- Generating citations for a fragment
- Word integration (inserting citations as you write)

**Cost**: Free (open-source software)

**Why Week 5?** Source-based writing has already begun (Week 4), so you understand *why* you need citation management before learning *how* the tool works.

### Week 6: Zotero Check-In (embedded touch)

Brief 5-10 minute check during a writing block: Are you adding sources correctly? Any questions or problems?

### Week 7: Eli Helpfulness Discussion (embedded touch)

Brief 10-minute discussion during a revision block: What makes feedback helpful? What patterns do you notice in the comments you've received?

## What Success Looks Like

By the end of Movement 2, you should have:

✓ **A growing corpus** of 20-28 fragments, including source-based writing  
✓ **A Zotero library** with sources organized and tagged  
✓ **Completed Spec Document + Constraint Audit** (M2 milestones)  
✓ **Experience giving/receiving peer feedback** through Eli Review  
✓ **Organizational habits** for routing material to appropriate locations  
✓ **Awareness of how constraints shape** what you write  
✓ **Dev log practice** documenting your writing process

**Most important**: You should feel like you're developing *systems for working* rather than just completing isolated assignments. You're learning to classify, route, and organize material so you can find and use it later.

## Common Questions

**Q**: What if I don't understand how to use Zotero after the library session?  
**A**: That's normal—you'll learn by using it, not by watching the demo. The goal of the library session is to get started, not to master everything. Use the check-in (Week 6) to ask questions. Also see the Zotero documentation folder in Canvas for tutorials.

**Q**: What's the difference between Spec Document and Constraint Audit assignments?  
**A**: Spec Document is forward-looking (planning what you'll write). Constraint Audit is backward-looking (analyzing what shaped existing writing). Both teach constraint awareness, but from different angles.

**Q**: How do I know what makes good peer feedback?  
**A**: Good feedback is *specific* (points to particular places in the draft), *substantive* (addresses ideas and structure, not just typos), and *actionable* (gives you something you can actually do). Bad feedback is vague ("good job!"), mean ("this sucks"), or unhelpful ("fix everything").

**Q**: Can I change how I organize my fragments if my current system isn't working?  
**A**: Yes! Your organizational system should serve you, not constrain you. If sorting by Movement isn't helpful, try sorting by topic, by project, or by "related to X reading." The goal is a system that helps you *find* and *connect* material when you need it.

**Q**: What if I'm still behind on fragment production?  
**A**: M2 is a good time to catch up. Use writing blocks to generate, not just revise. Consider whether you need to adjust your workflow: write at different times, use different methods, ask for help identifying barriers.

---

## Transition to Movement 3

By Week 8, you'll have substantial accumulated material (20-28 fragments) *and* organizational systems for working with it. Movement 3 shifts to **operating at scale**—what do you do when your corpus is large enough that you can't keep it all in your head? You'll learn distillation, connection work, and corpus management strategies.

**Movement 2's gift to Movement 3**: Classified material with source connections, ready for consolidation and connection work.
