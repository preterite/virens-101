### How This Course Is Organized: The Block System

This course uses a **block-based structure** rather than traditional class sessions. Understanding this structure will help you make the most of our time together.

#### What Is a Block?

A **block** is a 25-minute unit of focused work. Each week we have **6 blocks** (150 total minutes), which can be configured in different ways depending on your section:

- **Option 1**: One 150-minute session per week (6 blocks in a row with short breaks)
- **Option 2**: Two 75-minute sessions per week (3 blocks each session)
- **Option 3**: Three 50-minute sessions per week (2 blocks each session)

Your specific section's meeting pattern will be listed in the course schedule.

#### Why Blocks?

Traditional courses often mix activities within one class period—a bit of lecture, some discussion, maybe writing time. The block system makes **types of work** visible and distinct:

- Some blocks are for **Writing** (W): focused generative work, drafting, capturing ideas
- Some blocks are for **Peer Review** (P): giving and receiving feedback through Eli Review
- Some blocks are for **Revision** (R): processing feedback, reorganizing, developing fragments
- Some blocks are for **Tech** (T): learning tools like Zotero, file organization, Eli Review
- Some blocks are for **Other**: conferences, presentations, syllabus review, flex time

You'll always know what *kind* of work we're doing in each block. This helps you prepare mentally and brings the right materials.

## Semester Overview: 90 Blocks Total

The full semester has **90 blocks** (15 weeks × 6 blocks/week). Here's how they're allocated:

### Time Budget

| Category | Blocks | What This Means |
|----------|--------|-----------------|
| **Available for instruction** | 62 | Class time for writing, peer review, revision |
| Holiday/campus events | 2 | Days when campus is closed |
| Flex buffer | 2 | Backup time for when things run long |
| Conference week (Week 9) | 6 | One-on-one meetings with instructor |
| Tech instruction | 6 | Learning Zotero, Eli Review, file management |
| Library session | 2 | Research skills with librarian |
| Presentations (Week 14) | 6 | Sharing work with class |
| Envelope exercise + return | 2 | Special activities Week 1 and Week 15 |
| Syllabus review | 2 | First day orientation |
| **Total** | **90** | **Complete semester** |

### What You'll Do in the 62 Available Blocks

Most of our class time goes toward **three core activities**:

1. **Writing (W)**: 30-31 blocks — Generating fragments, drafting, capturing ideas
2. **Revision (R)**: 23-24 blocks — Processing feedback, reorganizing, developing your work
3. **Peer Review (P)**: 8-9 blocks — Giving and receiving feedback in Eli Review

**Key insight:** Notice that we spend almost as much time on **revision** as on **initial writing**. That's intentional—revision isn't optional polishing, it's core intellectual work.

## How Blocks Change Across the Semester

The balance of Writing/Peer Review/Revision shifts as the course progresses:

### Movement 1: Surfacing (Weeks 1-3)
- **Focus**: Expansion, exploration, building your corpus
- **Typical block distribution**: Mostly Writing, minimal Peer Review
- **Why**: You need material before you can get feedback on it

### Movement 2: Naming (Weeks 4-7)
- **Focus**: Source engagement, structured feedback, categorization
- **Typical block distribution**: Balanced Writing, Peer Review, and Revision
- **Why**: You have enough fragments for meaningful peer review; time to learn structured feedback

### Movement 3: Operating at Scale (Weeks 8-11)
- **Focus**: Managing your growing corpus, consolidation
- **Typical block distribution**: Increased Revision, sustained Writing
- **Why**: Your corpus is large (30+ fragments); revision means deciding what to develop

### Movement 4: Synthesis (Weeks 12-15)
- **Focus**: Portfolio assembly, selection, final polish
- **Typical block distribution**: Heavy Revision, minimal new Writing
- **Why**: Shifting from generation to curation and final development

## What This Looks Like in Practice

### Example Week (Week 5, Movement 2)

**Monday** (if meeting once/week for 150 min):
- Block 1: **W** — Freewriting on current reading
- Block 2: **W** — Develop freewriting into fragment with source
- *5-minute break*
- Block 3: **P** — Introduction to Eli Review
- Block 4: **P** — Practice giving feedback in Eli
- *5-minute break*
- Block 5: **R** — Review feedback you received, plan revision
- Block 6: **R** — Revise one fragment based on peer comments

**Notice:**
- Each block has a **clear purpose** (you know what mode we're in)
- Blocks **build on each other** (write → review → revise)
- **Short breaks** between every 2 blocks keep you fresh

## Tips for Success with the Block System

### Before Class
- Check the weekly schedule to see what blocks are planned
- Bring appropriate materials (laptop for Writing blocks, printed drafts for Revision blocks, etc.)
- Know which mode we're starting with so you can shift into that headspace

### During Class
- **Stay present** during each block—no multitasking
- When we **shift modes**, consciously shift your mindset (e.g., from generating new text to evaluating existing text)
- Use breaks to rest, not catch up on work from previous block

### After Class
- **Dev log entries** reflect on which blocks were most/least productive
- **Fragment tracking** records which blocks produced new fragments
- **Planning** uses block labels to identify what's coming next week

---

## Flexibility and Adaptation

While the overall block structure is fixed, **how we use individual blocks can flex** based on class needs:

- If a Writing block is going well, we might extend it and compress another activity
- If tech instruction takes less time than expected, that becomes available time
- If everyone needs more revision time mid-semester, we can reallocate blocks

You'll always know the plan ahead of time via the course calendar, and any changes will be announced.

## Questions About Blocks

**Q: What if I finish early during a Writing block?**  
**A:** Use remaining time to start another fragment, review your corpus, or work on dev log. The block time is protected for writing work.

**Q: Can I work on homework during a Revision block?**  
**A:** No—Revision blocks are for revising *your writing for this class*. The block structure protects time for this work.

**Q: What if I miss a class and miss several blocks?**  
**A:** Check the schedule to see what blocks you missed, then do equivalent work outside class. E.g., if you missed 2 Writing blocks, produce 2 fragments at home.

**Q: Why not just have "class time" without labeling everything?**  
**A:** The labels make **invisible work visible**. When you see "R block," you know revision is valued work requiring dedicated time, not just homework you squeeze in.

## Implementation Notes

**For students in different scheduling formats:**

- **1×150min sections**: You'll experience all 6 blocks in one marathon session with breaks
- **2×75min sections**: You'll have 3 blocks per meeting; rhythm stays consistent within each session
- **3×50min sections**: You'll have 2 blocks per meeting; activities may span multiple class days

The core principle stays the same: **every block has a purpose, every mode is visible**.
