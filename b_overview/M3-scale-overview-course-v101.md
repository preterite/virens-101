# Movement 3: Operating at Scale (Weeks 8-11)

## Movement Overview

**Core Question**: What happens when your corpus gets large enough that you can't hold it all in your head? How do you work with accumulated material at scale?

**Metaphor**: Managing the growing collection. In Movement 3, you're consolidating, refactoring, and creating connections across fragments. You're learning to *distill* (extract essentials from larger amounts of material) and *connect* (link related pieces to see patterns).

**Duration**: 4 weeks (Weeks 8-11) | ~25 blocks

**Mode Emphasis**: W+R heavy (writing and revision dominate, with strategic peer review)

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of Movement 3, you will be able to:

- **Distill essential insights** from larger bodies of text by refactoring and consolidation
- **Connect related fragments** by identifying patterns and relationships across your corpus
- **Manage corpus-level operations** like inventorying, mapping, and genealogy tracing
- **Evaluate source relationships** using BEAM Portfolio methodology
- **Refactor earlier work** by revising fragments now that you have more context
- **Build your corpus** to 30-42 fragments by end of Week 11
- **Document your process** systematically through dev logs and system maps

**Key Principle Deepened**: **Constraint Sequencing**—You'll experience deliberate removal of scaffolding to see what it was doing. You'll also map your own constraint sequences for transfer to future projects.

## What You'll Be Doing

### Week-by-Week Focus

| Week | Primary Activity | Milestone |
|------|-------|-----------|
| **Week 8** | Digital transfer, corpus inventory, source genealogy | "What You're Automating" session (T5) |
| **Week 9** | Individual conferences (no class meetings) | Conference week |
| **Week 10** | BEAM Portfolio drafting, content mapping | Eli Review cycle |
| **Week 11** | BEAM Portfolio completion, documented inquiry planning | Complete BEAM Portfolio |

### Typical Week Structure

Movement 3 balances writing and revision, with less peer review than M2:

**Example week pattern**:
- **Blocks 1-2** (50 min): Writing (W) — BEAM Portfolio entries, refactoring
- **Blocks 3-4** (50 min): Revision (R) or Writing (W) — Consolidation work
- **Blocks 5-6** (50 min): Writing (W) or Revision (R) — Continue corpus management

**Homework**: Reading (40-60 pages/week) + corpus review + BEAM Portfolio work

## Key Activities & Assignments

### Digital Transfer: "What You're Automating" (Week 8, T5)

By Week 8, you have ~25 fragments accumulated over 7 weeks. Movement 3 opens with a tech session focused not on *how* to use digital tools but *why* automation matters.

**Session focus**:
- What work have you been doing by hand with index cards?
- What patterns emerge when you look at your whole corpus?
- How does digital organization map onto physical organization?
- What can you automate vs. what requires human judgment?

**Purpose**: Students understand organizational systems as *choices* that enable certain operations. Digital transfer isn't "upgrading"—it's recognizing what you've been doing and choosing appropriate tools for scale.

### Corpus Inventory (Week 8)

**Activity**: Take stock of what you have.

**Questions to answer**:
- How many fragments do you have? (target: ~20-28 at Week 8 start)
- What topics/themes recur?
- Which fragments connect to each other?
- Which sources appear multiple times?
- What's missing? What gaps do you notice?

**Purpose**: Corpus inventory makes accumulation *visible*. Students see patterns they couldn't see when writing one fragment at a time.

### Refactoring Earlier Fragments (Week 8-11)

**What is refactoring?** Restructuring text without changing its essential meaning. In software, refactoring improves code quality without changing external behavior. In writing, refactoring clarifies, consolidates, or reorganizes without changing the argument.

**Examples**:
- Combining two related fragments into one stronger piece
- Splitting an overloaded fragment into two focused ones
- Reorganizing a fragment for clearer flow
- Strengthening a weak claim now that you have more evidence

**Purpose**: Early fragments were written with limited context. Now you have more material, more sources, more understanding. Refactoring updates early work to match your current knowledge.

### Source Genealogy Exercise (Week 8)

**Activity**: Trace where your sources came from.

**Process**:
1. Pick a key source from your Zotero library
2. Look at its bibliography—what does it cite?
3. Trace backward: what earlier sources shaped this one?
4. Trace forward: what newer sources cite this one?
5. Map the network of related sources

**Purpose**: Sources don't exist in isolation—they're nodes in networks. Understanding genealogy helps you find related sources and see how conversations develop over time.

### BEAM Portfolio (Due Week 11)

**Assignment**: Create an expanded annotated bibliography that categorizes sources by function and demonstrates your understanding of how sources work in academic writing.

**What it includes**:
- 8-10 sources from your Zotero library
- Each source tagged with BEAM category (Background/Exhibit/Argument/Method)
- Annotation for each source (150-300 words) covering:
  - Summary: What does this source say/do?
  - BEAM function: How would you use this in writing?
  - Connection: How does this relate to other sources or your inquiry?

**Format**: Organized document with clear sections

**Assessment**: 50 points (Movement 3 milestone)

**Connection to course principles**: BEAM Portfolio operationalizes source classification at scale. Instead of treating sources as undifferentiated "research," you're learning to see functional differences.

### Content Mapping (Week 10)

**Activity**: Create a visual map of your corpus showing connections between fragments.

**Process**:
- List all fragments
- Identify which ones share topics, themes, or sources
- Draw connections (literal or figurative)
- Note clusters and gaps

**Purpose**: Mapping makes relationships visible. Students see which fragments cluster (potential for consolidation) and which stand isolated (potential for development or connection).

### Conference Week (Week 9)

Movement 3 includes a full week of individual conferences. You'll meet one-on-one with the instructor to discuss your progress, troubleshoot challenges, and plan for the final portfolio.

**What to bring**:
- Your corpus inventory results
- Questions about refactoring or consolidation
- Draft BEAM Portfolio entries (if ready)
- Dev log for review

---

## Six Moves Vocabulary: Distill & Connect

Movement 3 focuses on two new moves: **Distill** and **Connect**.

**Distill** = Extract the essential insight from larger material  
**Connect** = Link related items to see patterns

**What it looks like**:
- Refactoring three related fragments into one focused piece (distill)
- Identifying that fragments 7, 15, 23, and 31 all address similar questions (connect)
- Reducing a 500-word fragment to its core 200-word insight (distill)
- Mapping source genealogies to see how ideas flow through scholarly conversations (connect)

**Why it matters**: You can't just keep generating forever—at some point you need to consolidate, clarify, and see relationships. Distillation and connection turn volume into coherence.

**Moves you've learned**: Capture (M1), Classify (M2), Route (M2)  
**Move you'll learn**: Publish (M4)

---

## Fragment Target Trajectory

By end of M3 (Week 11): **30-42 fragments total** (10-14 new fragments in M3)

**Production rate in M3**: 3-4 fragments per week continues, but now you're also refactoring earlier fragments. Some "new" fragments might come from splitting or combining existing ones rather than pure generation.

**Quality shift**: M3 fragments demonstrate connection work—they reference other fragments, build on earlier ideas, and show awareness of patterns across your corpus. They're increasingly sophisticated.

---

## Technology & Organization

### Week 8: "What You're Automating" (T5)

This tech session is conceptual, not procedural. You already know *how* to use your tools (index cards, OneDrive, Zotero). Now you're learning *why* organizational systems matter at scale.

**Questions explored**:
- What work do your tools do for you?
- What decisions do they make easier?
- What can't they do (what still requires human judgment)?
- How do physical and digital systems complement each other?

### Week 10: Folder Organization Check (embedded touch)

Brief 5-minute check during a revision block: Are you maintaining your folder structure? Are files named consistently? Can you find things quickly?

### Week 11: Process Documentation Review (embedded touch)

Brief 10-minute review during a revision block: Are your dev logs current? Have you started system maps? Is your process documentation keeping pace with your work?

---

## What Success Looks Like

By the end of Movement 3, you should have:

✓ **A substantial corpus** of 30-42 fragments across multiple topics  
✓ **A completed BEAM Portfolio** demonstrating source classification skills  
✓ **Refactored fragments** that show consolidation and improvement  
✓ **Content maps** or inventories showing patterns in your work  
✓ **Documented process** through updated dev logs and system maps  
✓ **Corpus-level awareness** of what you have and how it connects  
✓ **Systems understanding** of what your organizational tools enable

**Most important**: You should feel like you're *managing* a body of work rather than just producing individual pieces. You can find related fragments quickly, identify patterns, and see gaps.

## Common Questions

**Q**: What if I'm behind on fragment production and don't have 25+ fragments at Week 8?  
**A**: Use M3 writing blocks to catch up. Refactoring can also *generate* new fragments—splitting one overloaded fragment into two focused ones counts as production. Conference week (Week 9) is a good time to strategize about closing gaps.

**Q**: How do I know which fragments to refactor vs. leave alone?  
**A**: Refactor fragments that (1) still seem relevant to your current inquiry, (2) could be strengthened with your new knowledge, or (3) connect to other fragments. Leave alone fragments that feel complete or that represent ideas you've moved past.

**Q**: What's the difference between BEAM Portfolio and traditional annotated bibliography?  
**A**: BEAM Portfolio emphasizes *function* (how you'd use each source) over just summary. Traditional annotated bibs describe sources; BEAM Portfolios explain what sources *do* in writing.

**Q**: Can I include sources in my BEAM Portfolio that I haven't used in fragments yet?  
**A**: Yes! BEAM Portfolio can include sources you've collected but not yet incorporated. This shows you're building a research base for future work.

**Q**: What if my corpus inventory reveals that I've been writing about totally unrelated topics?  
**A**: That's useful information! It might mean you need to choose a focus for your final portfolio, or it might reveal unexpected connections you hadn't noticed. Diversity isn't a problem—fragmentation you can't explain or connect might be.

## Transition to Movement 4

By Week 12, you'll have substantial accumulated material (30-42 fragments), demonstrated source engagement (BEAM Portfolio), and documented processes (dev logs, system maps). Movement 4 shifts to **synthesis**—selecting, polishing, and assembling your final portfolio. You'll move from managing your corpus to publishing from it.

**Movement 3's gift to Movement 4**: Consolidated, mapped, and refactored material ready for final selection and polish.
