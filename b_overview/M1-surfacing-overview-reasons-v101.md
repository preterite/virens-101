## Design Philosophy

### Core Pedagogical Principle

Movement 1 operationalizes **textual accumulation as foundational practice**, counteracting the episodic structure of traditional composition assignments where students produce discrete papers that don't build on each other. The movement establishes writing-as-verb (process, labor) before emphasizing writing-as-noun (product, capital), allowing students to generate raw material without premature concern for polish or correctness.

The design prioritizes **capture over critique**, establishing psychological safety for messy early-stage thinking. Students learn that writing doesn't begin with complete thoughts but rather *produces* complete thoughts through the act of writing itself.

### Theoretical Grounding

**Post-Process Recursiveness** (Salvatori, Bernstein): Movement 1 embodies the insight that writing is not a linear progress from planning to drafting to revision, but a recursive process where discovery happens through composing. The freewriting emphasis and envelope exercise teach students to write-to-think rather than think-to-write.

**Failure-as-Diagnostic** (Schön, reflective practice): By normalizing messiness and incompleteness, M1 reframes "bad" early drafts not as failure but as necessary artifacts of a working process. Difficulty is informational signal, not deficiency.

**Habits of Mind** (Framework for Success in Postsecondary Writing): The movement cultivates *Persistence* (sustained engagement with writing), *Openness* (willingness to experiment without immediate success), and *Metacognition* (observing one's own writing processes).

**Key Sources:**

- Schön, Donald. *The Reflective Practitioner*. 1983.
- CWPA, NCTE & NWP. "Framework for Success in Postsecondary Writing." 2011.

**Concepts Applied:**
- Iteration before correctness
- Volume generates quality (you can't revise what doesn't exist)
- Writing produces thinking (not just records it)
- Accumulation creates options (corpus-based composition vs. single-essay production)

## Learning Objectives

### Why These Objectives?

Movement 1 objectives target **generative capacity** rather than evaluative judgment. Students learn to *produce* before they learn to *assess*. This sequencing is deliberate: premature evaluation shuts down generation. By focusing first on capture, expansion, and accumulation, students build confidence and material to work with.

The objectives emphasize **observable behaviors** rather than abstract qualities: "generate 300-500 words in a sitting" rather than "develop voice" or "show creativity." This makes success concrete and measurable, reducing anxiety about ambiguous expectations.

### Scaffolding Logic

**Builds on:** Students arrive with internalized constraints about writing (often counterproductive: "never use 'I'", "always plan before writing", "perfect first drafts"). M1 *surfaces* these constraints by creating situations where they don't apply, making them visible for later examination.

**Prepares for:** Movement 2 requires material to classify and organize. Without M1's accumulation work, students would have nothing to sort. M2's feedback cycles require drafts; M1 teaches draft production. M3's corpus management requires a corpus; M1 builds it.

**Constraint Sequencing Principle**: M1 minimizes constraints deliberately. Few requirements, high freedom, emphasis on volume. Constraints arrive in M2 (organization, citation, audience) and M3 (coherence, connection, polish). This sequence allows students to *generate freely* before learning to *shape deliberately*.

## Pedagogical Approach

### Activity Design Rationale

**Envelope Exercise** (Week 1, Blocks 2-3): The envelope provides external constraint (you don't choose what's inside) that paradoxically liberates students from decision paralysis. Found constraints are easier to work with than invented ones for novice writers. The exercise also creates a "time capsule" effect—returning the envelope at Week 3 allows students to see their own progress.

**Pedagogical foundation**: Constraint-based writing (Oulipo tradition), found-object composition exercises, and Elbow's freewriting practice. The surprise element disrupts self-consciousness and activates play.

**Freewriting Emphasis**: Blocks 3-6 of most weeks are generative writing time. This is unusual in composition courses, which often favor *discussion* of writing over *doing* writing in class. The design inverts this: most class time is writing time, with discussion embedded in writing activities.

**Pedagogical foundation**: Peter Elbow's freewriting methodology, writing-across-the-curriculum emphasis on "writing to learn," and studio pedagogy from art/design education (making in the presence of others).

**Compression Exercise** (Week 3): After expansion work, students compress (300→200→100 words). This teaches *distillation*—identifying core ideas by radical reduction. It's premature for students to evaluate what's "essential" without first generating freely, so compression comes late in M1, not early.

**Pedagogical foundation**: Revision as *re-seeing* (Nancy Sommers), not just correcting. Compression forces students to see their text as a set of choices, making the familiar strange.

### Time Allocation Logic

**W-W-W-W-W-W pattern** (most M1 weeks): Six writing blocks per week might seem excessive, but research on writing development suggests that *volume* is a stronger predictor of improvement than intensive feedback on limited writing. Students in M1 produce more text than in traditional comp courses (30-40 pages of fragments vs. 12-15 pages of essays), creating multiple opportunities to practice.

**Minimal R and P blocks**: Revision and peer review are premature when students lack material. M1 teaches generation first; M2 introduces structured feedback when students have drafts worth receiving feedback on.

**Opening/Main/Closing** (typical blocks):
- **Opening** (5 min): Brief prompt or provocation to prime thinking
- **Main Activity** (18 min): Sustained writing without interruption
- **Closing** (2 min): Save, name file, update dev log entry

This structure honors the cognitive science principle that *sustained attention* is required for deep engagement, and that frequent interruption fragments working memory.

### Differentiation Strategies

**For students who struggle with freewriting**: Alternative capture methods permitted (bullet lists, conversation transcripts, voice-to-text). The goal is *capture*, not any specific form.

**For students who finish early**: Prompt extensions ("now do the same with a different constraint") or encourage fragment expansion rather than waiting.

**For students who resist messiness**: Reframe as experiment, not performance. "What happens if you write badly on purpose?" can unlock students who equate writing with correctness.

**For students with processing challenges**: Index cards provide tactile/visual alternative to screen-based composition. Physical sorting can be easier than digital organization.

## Assignment Design

### Literacy Narrative with Constraint Experiment

**Why this assignment specifically?**

Literacy narratives are composition pedagogy staples for good reason: they ask students to write about something they have expertise in (their own experience), reducing research burden while still requiring analysis. The constraint experiment addition (compression to 200, then 100 words) transforms a potentially formulaic assignment into genuine inquiry.

**Connection to course innovations**: The compression sequence teaches students that *constraints change content*, not just form—a principle central to the course's constraint sequencing approach. Students discover that what they say in 1000 words differs from what they say in 100 words, making visible the relationship between form and meaning.

### Prompt Design

**Expansion before compression**: Students write freely first (1000+ words), then compress. This sequence is critical. If students start with compression, they self-censor during generation. If they generate first, compression becomes a *discovery* exercise rather than a reduction exercise.

**Constraint Rationale**:

| Constraint | Pedagogical Purpose |
|------------|-------------------|
| "1000 words minimum" | Ensures substantial generation; students can't satisfy with a paragraph |
| "About your literacy history" | Content they have access to without research |
| "Compress to 200, then 100" | Makes constraint effects visible; teaches distillation |
| "Multiple attempts allowed" | Emphasizes iteration over single-draft perfection |

### Anticipated Student Interpretations

**Possible misreading**: "The point is to make my literacy narrative shorter and shorter." 
**Mitigation**: Frame compression as *experiment*, not improvement. Ask: "What changes when you compress? What stays? What disappears?" The goal is observation, not optimization.

**Possible misreading**: "I need to make the compressed versions 'as good as' the long version."
**Mitigation**: Explain that 100-word version *should* be different—not worse, but different in kind. It's a different genre with different constraints.

## Assessment Criteria

### Rubric Philosophy

M1 assessment values **evidence of process** over quality of product. The Literacy Narrative is graded on completion and engagement, not sophistication or polish. This aligns with M1's purpose: establishing generative habits, not evaluating writing quality.

**Portfolio-delayed grading**: While the Literacy Narrative receives a milestone grade (50 pts), students can revise it for inclusion in the final portfolio (450 pts), where it will be assessed more rigorously. This separates *doing the work* (M1 milestone) from *quality of output* (final portfolio).

### Criterion Weighting

| Criterion | Weight | Justification |
|-----------|--------|---------------|
| Completion of all parts (1000w + 200w + 100w) | 40% | Demonstrates engagement with full process |
| Evidence of expansion (loose, exploratory writing) | 25% | Shows willingness to generate freely |
| Evidence of compression (meaningful reduction) | 25% | Shows ability to distill |
| Process documentation (dev log entries) | 10% | Establishes metacognitive habit |

**Note**: Quality of *prose style* is not a criterion in M1 milestone grading. Students are not penalized for "rough" writing. This is intentional—polishing comes later.

### Formative vs. Summative

M1 milestone grade is **primarily formative**: it confirms that students are engaging with the process and generating material. The summative assessment happens in M4 when students select, revise, and polish fragments for the final portfolio.

This distinction is crucial: M1 establishes *habits* (generate regularly, accumulate material, document process) that pay off later. Early grading should reward establishing those habits, not judge products before students have learned to revise them.

## Scaffolding & Support

### Support Strategy

**Tech support timing**: Index cards and folder setup (T1) happen *after* students have written for a week, so they're organizing material they've already generated. This makes the organizational systems feel useful rather than bureaucratic.

**Eli Review introduction**: Familiarization (T2) is *ungraded* and happens weeks before the first graded peer review cycle. Students "touch the buttons" without stakes, reducing anxiety about new tools.

**Embedded check-ins**: Instructor circulates during writing blocks, observing students' processes and offering brief encouragement or troubleshooting. This is *low-intervention support*—presence without interruption.

### Common Struggles

**Struggle**: "I don't know what to write about."  
**Intervention**: Prompts become more specific. "Write about a time you failed at something." "Write about what you read this week." External constraints paradoxically increase freedom by reducing decision space.

**Struggle**: "I keep editing as I write and can't generate freely."  
**Intervention**: Physical tricks: write by hand (harder to delete), use voice-to-text (can't see text to edit), set timer and commit to not stopping. Sometimes behavioral constraints override psychological ones.

**Struggle**: "My fragments feel disconnected and random."  
**Intervention**: Reframe as *feature, not bug*. Randomness is correct in M1. Connection work happens in M2-M3. For now, disconnection means students aren't artificially forcing coherence prematurely.

**Struggle**: "I'm not accumulating enough fragments—I'm behind."  
**Intervention**: Investigate barriers. Is it time management? Unclear expectations? Tech problems? Often students are writing but not *saving* work in the portfolio folder, so evidence of accumulation is invisible to them.

## Evidence & Iteration

### Evidence to Collect

- [ ] Fragment count per student at Week 3 checkpoint (target: 8-12)
- [ ] Dev log entries (frequency, substance)
- [ ] Student self-reported comfort with freewriting (pre/post survey)
- [ ] Literacy Narrative compression artifacts (do students meaningfully compress, or just delete sentences?)
- [ ] Participation in writing blocks (on-task behavior, sustained attention)

### Revision Notes

**From Spring 2024 pilot** (if applicable): 
- Students struggled with file naming initially. Consider providing a template document with correct naming as model.
- Some students finished compression too quickly—may need to require multiple compression attempts (try three different 100-word versions, not just one).
- Envelope exercise worked well but needs clearer instructions about what to *do* with the envelope contents after opening.

**For future iterations**:
- Consider adding peer "accountability partners" for fragment production—check in with each other weekly, share fragment counts.
- Experiment with group freewriting warm-ups (everyone writes for 5 minutes on same prompt) to reduce start-up anxiety.
