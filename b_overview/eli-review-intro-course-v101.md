## What Is Eli Review?

Eli Review is a web-based platform designed specifically for structured peer feedback. Think of it as a workflow manager for the review process:

1. You submit your draft
2. Eli assigns you peers to review
3. You read their work and give feedback
4. You receive feedback on your own draft
5. You rate how helpful the feedback was
6. You use the feedback to plan your revision

This happens **in class** during Peer Review (P) blocks, not as homework.

---

## Week 2: Touch the Buttons (Ungraded)

Your first encounter with Eli Review is **familiarization only**. The goal is to know where the buttons are and what the cycle feels like, not to master the feedback process.

### What You'll Do

1. **Submit** a brief fragment (anything you've written so far)
2. **Review** 1-2 peers' fragments with very simple feedback
3. **Receive** feedback from peers on your fragment
4. **Done** - No revision required, no grades

**Time**: One 25-minute class block

**Purpose**: Get comfortable with the interface before performance matters.

---

## The Basic Cycle

### Step 1: Submit Your Draft

- Log in to Eli Review (link provided in Canvas)
- Find the current task (e.g., "Week 2 Practice Task")
- Upload your document or paste text directly
- Click "Submit"

**Deadline matters**: If you miss the draft deadline, you won't be assigned reviewers and won't receive feedback.

---

### Step 2: Review Peers' Work

After the draft deadline closes, Eli assigns you 2-3 peers to review. You'll see their drafts in your task queue.

**What to do:**
1. Read the draft carefully
2. Answer the review prompts provided (specific questions about the draft)
3. Write comments in the text boxes
4. Submit your review

**In Week 2**: Prompts will be very simple, like "What is the main claim?" or "What did you find interesting?"

**Later in semester**: Prompts will use the **Describe-Evaluate-Suggest** model:
- **Describe**: What is the writer trying to do?
- **Evaluate**: How well does it work?
- **Suggest**: What specific change would improve it?

---

### Step 3: Receive Feedback

After all reviews are submitted, you can see the feedback your peers gave you.

**What you'll see:**
- Comments on specific aspects of your draft
- Responses to the review prompts
- Ratings (if used)

**What to do with it:**
- Read all feedback, even if it contradicts
- Look for patterns (multiple reviewers saying the same thing)
- Decide what to use in revision (you're in charge)

---

### Step 4: Rate Helpfulness

After reading your feedback, rate how helpful each review was:

- **Very Helpful**: Specific, actionable, helped me see something new
- **Somewhat Helpful**: General but useful
- **Not Helpful**: Too vague, off-topic, or unhelpful

**Why this matters:**
- Helps you reflect on what makes feedback useful
- Gives your peers information about their reviewing skills
- Creates accountability (unhelpful feedback is noticed)

---

### Step 5: Revise

Use the feedback to plan and execute your revision.

**In Week 2**: No revision required (just practice).

**In Week 5+**: Revisions are graded. You'll save revised versions using the naming convention: `YYYY-MM-DD-topic-slug-revised.docx`

---

## Week 5 and Beyond: Graded Cycles

Starting in Week 5, Eli Review cycles will be **graded**. You earn points for:

1. **Submitting your draft on time** (participation)
2. **Completing peer reviews thoroughly** (quality of feedback)
3. **Rating feedback helpfulness** (reflection)
4. **Completing the revision** (quality of revised draft)

**Typical cycle**: 6 Eli Review cycles across the semester, worth ~40 points each = 240 total points (about 24% of course grade).

## Interface Walkthrough

### Dashboard

When you log in, you'll see:
- **Active Tasks**: Current review cycles (drafts to submit, reviews to complete)
- **Completed Tasks**: Past cycles (archived)
- **Notifications**: Deadlines, feedback received

### Task Page

Each task has phases:
- **Write**: Submit your draft (deadline shown)
- **Review**: Complete peer reviews (deadline shown)
- **Feedback**: View feedback on your draft (available after review deadline)
- **Revise**: Upload your revision (deadline shown)

---

## Common Questions

### "What if I don't have a draft ready by the deadline?"

Late drafts don't get assigned to reviewers. You'll miss out on feedback. Plan ahead.

### "What if my reviewer gave me unhelpful feedback?"

Rate it as "Not Helpful" and note why in your dev log. You're not obligated to use unhelpful feedback.

### "Can I see who reviewed my work?"

That depends on the task settings. Some tasks are anonymous; some aren't. Your instructor will tell you.

### "What if I disagree with the feedback?"

That's fine. Feedback is information, not orders. Your job is to read it, consider it, and make informed choices about your revision.

### "How long does a review cycle take?"

- Submitting a draft: 5 minutes (if draft is ready)
- Reviewing 2-3 peers: 30-40 minutes (done in class)
- Reading your feedback: 10-15 minutes
- Rating helpfulness: 5 minutes
- Planning revision: 15-20 minutes (dev log entry)

## Tips for Success

### For Submitting

- Have your draft ready before the deadline
- Use the file naming convention
- Double-check that you uploaded the right file

### For Reviewing

- Read the whole draft before commenting
- Be specific: "Your claim is unclear" vs. "I don't understand what you're arguing in paragraph 2"
- Answer the review prompts fully—don't skip them
- Focus on helping the writer, not showing off your own knowledge

### For Using Feedback

- Read all feedback before reacting
- Look for patterns across multiple reviewers
- Separate "this is confusing" (useful) from "I don't like this" (less useful)
- Remember: you decide what to revise

---

## Troubleshooting

### "I can't log in"

Check your WSU email for the Eli Review invitation. Click the link to set your password.

### "I don't see the current task"

Make sure you're in the correct course section. Check with your instructor.

### "I submitted the wrong file"

If the deadline hasn't passed, you can delete your submission and upload a new one.

### "I didn't finish my reviews in time"

Contact your instructor immediately. Late reviews may receive reduced credit.

### "The feedback I received is mean/rude"

Flag it for your instructor. Peer review should be constructive and respectful.

---

## What Success Looks Like

By the end of the semester, you should:
- Submit drafts on time consistently
- Give feedback that peers rate as "Very Helpful"
- Use feedback patterns to guide your revisions
- Recognize what makes feedback actionable vs. vague

Eli Review isn't just about getting feedback—it's about learning to **read like a writer** and **respond like a reader**.
