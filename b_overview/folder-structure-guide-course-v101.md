## Your ENGL 101 Portfolio Folder

By the end of Week 2, you'll have this folder structure set up in OneDrive. It will be your home base for the semester—where everything you write lives.

```

## What Each Folder Does

### 01-Fragments/

This is where your **writing fragments** live—the 150-400 word pieces you'll generate throughout the semester. 

**Subfolders by Movement:**
- `M1-Surfacing/` - Weeks 1-3: Early exploration, freewriting, literacy work
- `M2-Naming/` - Weeks 4-7: Source-based writing, citation work
- `M3-Scale/` - Weeks 8-11: Working with your accumulated corpus
- `M4-Synthesis/` - Weeks 12-15: Portfolio assembly, selection

**What goes here:** Any fragment you're developing. Draft 1, revised versions, experiments, responses to readings.

**What doesn't go here:** Final polished submissions (those go in `03-Submissions/`).

---

### 02-Process/

This is where you document **how** you're working, not just what you produce.

**Subfolders:**

**`dev-logs/`** - Your development logs. Think of these as lab notebooks for your writing process.
- Frequency: 2× per week minimum
- Format: Date, What I did, What happened, What I learned
- Filename: `dev-log-YYYY-MM-DD.docx`

**`system-maps/`** - Visual or text-based maps of your fragment corpus.
- Created: Week 4, Week 8, Week 12
- Shows: How your fragments connect, themes emerging, gaps you notice

---

### 03-Submissions/

This is where **finished work** goes.

**Subfolders:**

**`submitted/`** - Copies of everything you submit to Canvas
- Keep local copies here for your records
- Filename should match what you uploaded

**`returned/`** - Graded work with instructor feedback
- Download from Canvas and save here
- Compare with your `submitted/` version

**Why keep copies?** Canvas is institutional; OneDrive is yours. You'll want these files after the semester ends.

---

### 04-Resources/

This is for **course materials and references** you want to keep.

**What goes here:**
- Handouts from class
- Reading notes
- Examples shared by instructor
- Links or references you want to remember

**Optional:** You can organize this however makes sense to you. Subfolders by week? By topic? Your choice.

---

## File Naming Convention

Every document you create should follow this naming pattern:

```
YYYY-MM-DD-topic-slug-status.docx
```

### Examples

- `2026-02-03-literacy-memory-draft.docx`
- `2026-02-10-salvatori-difficulty-revised.docx`
- `2026-03-05-constraint-audit-polished.docx`

### Parts Explained

**YYYY-MM-DD**: Date you created or last significantly revised the file
- Uses ISO format (year-month-day) so files sort chronologically
- Example: `2026-02-03` not `02-03-2026`

**topic-slug**: Short 2-4 word description, separated by hyphens
- Describes the fragment's content or source
- Keep it concise but meaningful
- Examples: `literacy-memory`, `salvatori-difficulty`, `constraint-audit`

**status**: Current state of the fragment
- `draft` = First version, rough
- `revised` = Worked on after feedback
- `polished` = Near-final, carefully edited
- `submitted` = Turned in to Canvas

### Why This Convention?

1. **Chronological sorting**: Files automatically sort by date when you open a folder
2. **Findability**: You can search for `salvatori` and find every fragment about that reading
3. **Status tracking**: At a glance, you know what needs work
4. **Accumulation visible**: Over weeks, you see your corpus growing

## Dev Log Format

Your dev log is a running record of your writing process. Write **2 entries per week minimum**.

### Template

```
## [Date: YYYY-MM-DD]

### What I did
[What writing/reading/thinking happened today?]

### What happened
[What went well? What was hard? What surprised you?]

### What I learned
[What do you now know that you didn't before?]

---
```

### Example Entry

```
## Date: 2026-02-05

### What I did
Expanded my index card about Salvatori's "difficulty" concept into a 250-word fragment. Added a quote and tried to connect it to my literacy narrative.

### What happened
The quote was easy to find but hard to explain. I kept restating what Salvatori said instead of making my own claim. Took me 40 minutes to write 250 words.

### What I learned
I need to write my claim FIRST, then find the quote. When I start with the quote, I get stuck summarizing instead of arguing.

```

## Using the System

### Week 2: Setup

1. Create the folder structure in OneDrive
2. Practice saving a fragment with the naming convention
3. Write your first dev log entry

### Weeks 3-7: Building Corpus

1. Save 3-4 fragments per week in the appropriate Movement folder
2. Update dev log 2× per week
3. Keep index cards organized alongside digital files

### Week 8: Digital Transfer

1. Transfer your index card system into digital organization
2. Review your folders: What do you have? What's missing?
3. Clean up naming conventions if things have drifted

### Weeks 12-15: Portfolio Assembly

1. Use your folder structure to see your complete corpus
2. Select fragments to polish for portfolio
3. Move polished work to `03-Submissions/submitted/`

---

## Troubleshooting

### "I forgot the naming convention and now my files are a mess"

Set aside 30 minutes to rename everything at once. Use Find & Replace if you need to update many files with the same pattern. Update your dev log: what happened and what you fixed.

### "I don't know which Movement folder to use"

Use the current week. If you're in Week 6, save to `M2-Naming/`. Don't overthink it.

### "My dev log is getting really long"

That's good! It means you're documenting your process. You can start a new file each month if you want (`dev-log-february.docx`) or keep it all in one file. Either works.

### "I want to organize differently"

Talk to your instructor. The structure is a scaffold, not a cage. If you have a better system that serves the same purposes (chronology, findability, status tracking), propose it.

---

## Why This Matters

By Week 12, you should be able to:
- **Find any fragment** in under 30 seconds
- **See your corpus** at a glance
- **Trace a fragment's history** through version naming
- **Reflect on your process** using dev log as evidence

The folder structure isn't busywork—it's infrastructure that makes your accumulated work usable.
