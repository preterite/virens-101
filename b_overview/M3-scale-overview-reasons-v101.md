## Design Philosophy

### Core Pedagogical Principle

Movement 3 operationalizes **corpus-level thinking** and **consolidation work** that traditional composition courses typically omit. Where M1-M2 emphasized accumulation and classification, M3 teaches students to work *at scale*—to manage, analyze, and refactor larger bodies of text than they can hold in working memory.

The design recognizes a threshold most first-year writers never cross: the shift from producing individual texts to *managing a corpus*. This threshold is critical for academic work (research projects require source management, lit reviews require synthesis) and professional work (documentation systems, content strategy, knowledge management). M3 makes this threshold explicit and teachable.

The "W+R heavy" rhythm (writing plus revision, minimal peer review) reflects the cognitive work of consolidation: students need sustained time to *think across* their accumulated material, not just respond to feedback on individual pieces.

### Theoretical Grounding

**Refactoring as Revision** (software engineering → composition): Refactoring in programming means restructuring code to improve quality without changing external behavior. This concept translates powerfully to writing revision: students can reorganize, consolidate, or clarify *without* fundamentally changing their claims. Refactoring is "horizontal" revision (same level of sophistication, better organization) distinct from "vertical" revision (deeper thinking, stronger claims).

**Graph Thinking and Network Analysis**: M3's source genealogy and content mapping exercises teach students to see *relationships* rather than just *items*. This aligns with network theory (nodes and edges), citation analysis (who cites whom), and knowledge graph concepts (entities and relations). Students learn that scholarship isn't a collection of isolated texts but a network of conversations.

**Corpus Linguistics Principles**: Though M3 doesn't use computational tools, it borrows corpus linguistics' core insight: *patterns emerge at scale* that aren't visible in individual texts. Students' corpus inventories function like small-scale corpus analysis, revealing themes, gaps, and recurring structures.

- Star, Susan Leigh, and Geoffrey C. Bowker. *Sorting Things Out: Classification and Its Consequences*. MIT Press, 1999. [On invisible infrastructure]

**Concepts Applied:**
- Consolidation as distinct phase of composing (not just endless generation)
- Pattern recognition across accumulated material
- Refactoring as structured revision practice
- Source networks and citation genealogy
- Corpus-level operations (inventory, mapping, connection)

## Learning Objectives

### Why These Objectives?

Movement 3 objectives target **synthesis skills** and **meta-level awareness** that emerge only when students have substantial material to work with. You can't teach consolidation without accumulated material, and you can't teach corpus management without a corpus. M3 objectives are therefore *scale-dependent*—they make sense at Week 8-11 but wouldn't work at Week 2.

The objectives emphasize *operations on existing material* rather than generation of new material. Distillation, connection, refactoring, and inventory all assume students already have something to work with. This shift from production to management represents cognitive development: moving from "I need to write more" to "I need to organize what I have."

### Scaffolding Logic

**Builds on:** M2 established classification systems (BEAM, folder structure, dev logs). M3 uses those systems at scale. Students can now *find* related fragments because they've been classifying and routing consistently. Without M2's organizational groundwork, M3's consolidation work would be impossible.

**Prepares for:** M4 requires *selection* from corpus (which fragments make the final portfolio?) and *publication* (polishing for external readers). Both depend on M3's consolidation work. Students who've mapped their corpus and refactored key pieces can make informed selection decisions. Students who skip consolidation arrive at M4 with undifferentiated piles of text.

**Constraint Sequencing Principle**: M3 deliberately *removes* some scaffolding present in M1-M2:
- Fewer writing prompts (students decide what to write)
- Less structured feedback (conference week is individualized, not standardized)
- More independence (students navigate their own corpus rather than following instructor-specified paths)

This removal is pedagogical: students need to experience what the scaffolding was doing by working without it temporarily. The conference week provides support if students flounder, but the *default* is increased autonomy.

## Pedagogical Approach

### Activity Design Rationale

**"What You're Automating" Session** (Week 8, T5): This session is deliberately *conceptual* rather than *procedural*. Students already know *how* to use their tools. M3 opens by asking *why* those tools matter, what work they do, and what human judgment they can't replace.

**Pedagogical foundation**: Schön's "reflection-in-action" and Star & Bowker's "infrastructure invisibility." Systems are most visible when they break or when you shift systems. By asking students to articulate what their organizational systems enable, the session makes infrastructure visible. This metacognitive work supports transfer—students can apply principles to new contexts (lab notebooks, research projects, professional documentation) because they understand underlying logic, not just surface procedures.

**Corpus Inventory**: Borrowed from archival practice and corpus linguistics, but adapted for 20-fragment student corpora. The inventory creates a "bird's eye view" students couldn't achieve while writing one fragment at a time. It's a *perspective shift*—from inside-the-work to outside-the-work.

**Pedagogical foundation**: Metacognition research (Yancey, Taczak & Robertson) shows that reflection on patterns across work supports transfer. Corpus inventory is structured reflection: not "what did I learn?" (vague) but "what themes recur?" (answerable with evidence).

**Refactoring**: This borrows directly from software engineering's refactoring methodology but adapts it for prose. In code, refactoring improves quality without changing behavior. In writing, refactoring clarifies, reorganizes, or consolidates without changing fundamental claims.

**Pedagogical foundation**: Sommers' distinction between "expert" and "novice" revision. Novices revise at word/sentence level (surface changes). Experts revise at conceptual level (restructuring). Refactoring teaches *structural* revision while constraining *conceptual* revision—students change how ideas are organized without changing the ideas themselves. This bounded revision is more accessible than open-ended "make it better."

**Source Genealogy**: Tracing citation networks teaches students that scholarship is *historical*—sources don't appear in isolation but emerge from conversations. Genealogy work also reveals how to *find* more sources: if Source A cites Source B, and Source B is relevant, then following Source A's bibliography leads to related work.

**Pedagogical foundation**: Citation analysis (Garfield, Small), research methodology, and information literacy frameworks. Understanding source networks is a threshold concept for academic work—it changes how students search, read, and use sources.

### Time Allocation Logic

**W+R heavy pattern** (M3): The shift from M2's balanced W-P-R to M3's W+R emphasis reflects different cognitive demands. M3 work (consolidation, refactoring, mapping) requires sustained thinking *across* material. Frequent feedback cycles would interrupt that synthesis. Students need time to *live with* their corpus, see patterns, make connections.

**Why minimal P blocks?** M3 includes one Eli Review cycle (BEAM Portfolio), but otherwise de-emphasizes peer feedback. This is deliberate: M3 is inward-facing work (understanding your own corpus) rather than outward-facing work (presenting to others). Too much peer review in M3 would shift attention to external audiences prematurely.

**Conference week as breathing room**: Week 9's individual conferences serve multiple functions: (1) provide individualized support exactly when students need it, (2) create mid-semester pause for reflection, (3) allow instructor to diagnose issues impossible to see in full-class sessions, (4) model one-on-one consultation as professional norm.

### Differentiation Strategies

**For students who struggle with corpus inventory**:
- Provide structured templates: "List all fragments by topic" or "Count how many fragments mention each source"
- Start concrete (counting, listing) before moving to interpretation (patterns, gaps)
- Use physical index card sorting as alternative to digital spreadsheet work

**For students who resist refactoring**:
- Frame as "repair work" on early drafts, not criticism of original writing
- Emphasize that early fragments *should* need updating—you know more now than you did in Week 2
- Model refactoring on instructor's own writing to normalize the process

**For students who find source genealogy confusing**:
- Start with one high-value source and trace just one or two levels
- Use visual mapping (draw arrows) rather than just listing citations
- Connect to familiar network concepts (social media connections, family trees)

## Assignment Design

### BEAM Portfolio

**Why this assignment specifically?**

BEAM Portfolio extends M2's BEAM tagging into sustained analysis. Instead of just *tagging* sources, students *explain* how sources function, how they'd use them, and how they relate. This deepens source literacy from classification to application.

The portfolio format (8-10 sources with annotations) creates middle ground between traditional annotated bibliography (often just summaries) and full research paper (sources already integrated into argument). Students practice source analysis without yet committing to a specific argument or project.

**Connection to course innovations**: BEAM Portfolio operationalizes the "sources as tools" framework. Each annotation asks "how would I *use* this source?" forcing students to think strategically about source function. This prevents passive source accumulation ("I found 10 articles!") and encourages purposeful selection.

### Prompt Design

**BEAM Portfolio constraints**:

| Constraint | Pedagogical Purpose |
|------------|-------------------|
| "8-10 sources" | Substantial enough to show range, manageable enough to analyze deeply |
| "BEAM category for each" | Requires functional classification, not just description |
| "150-300 words per annotation" | Forces analysis beyond summary; requires explanation and connection |
| "Include connections to other sources" | Teaches network thinking; sources aren't isolated |

### Anticipated Student Interpretations

**Possible misreading**: "BEAM Portfolio is just an annotated bibliography with categories."  
**Mitigation**: Emphasize that annotations should explain *how you'd use* the source, not just *what it says*. Model the difference between descriptive annotation ("This source discusses X") and functional annotation ("I'd use this source as Background to establish that X is contested, then build my argument on different ground").

**Possible misreading**: "I need to use all these sources in my final portfolio."  
**Mitigation**: Clarify that BEAM Portfolio is *source inventory*, not *final paper bibliography*. Some sources may not make it into final work—that's fine. The portfolio shows you've explored multiple directions and made informed choices.

## Evidence & Iteration

### Evidence to Collect

- [ ] Fragment count per student at Week 11 checkpoint (target: 30-42)
- [ ] Corpus inventory completion (did students complete the inventory activity?)
- [ ] Refactoring evidence (how many students refactored early fragments?)
- [ ] Content map quality (do maps show meaningful connections or just lists?)
- [ ] BEAM Portfolio depth (do annotations show functional understanding or just summaries?)
- [ ] Source genealogy work (evidence of backward/forward citation tracing)
- [ ] Dev log entries M3 (frequency, evidence of consolidation work documented)

### Revision Notes

**From prior iterations** (if applicable):
- Students sometimes struggle to identify "what's essential" when refactoring—may need more concrete guidance on distillation criteria.
- Corpus inventory can feel overwhelming if students have fallen behind on fragments. Consider providing "rescue" strategies for students with <20 fragments at Week 8.
- Conference week timing is critical—must happen *after* enough accumulation (Week 8-9 works; earlier would be premature).

**For future iterations**:
- Experiment with peer corpus exchange: students look at each other's corpus inventories and suggest connections the writer didn't see.
- Consider developing "refactoring patterns" library—common moves students can try (combining, splitting, reordering, evidence strengthening).
- Explore computational tools for corpus analysis if/when students reach critical mass (Voyant Tools for word frequency, collocation analysis).

## Scale as Pedagogical Threshold

### Why Scale Matters

M3's innovation is treating *scale itself* as pedagogical variable. Most composition courses don't let students accumulate enough material to experience corpus-level operations. By Week 8, students have 20-28 fragments—enough that they *can't* remember everything they've written, forcing them to develop search/retrieval/organizational strategies.

This forced scaling is intentional. Students need to experience the problem (too much material to track mentally) before they can appreciate solutions (systems, tools, consolidation). If students only write 3-4 essays per semester, they never hit this threshold.

### Threshold Concepts at Scale

Several writing studies threshold concepts (Meyer & Land) emerge specifically at scale:

**"Writing is a process"** becomes concrete when students have 7 weeks of process documentation showing patterns they couldn't see day-to-day.

**"Sources are arguments, not information"** becomes visible when students trace citation genealogy and see how sources respond to each other.

**"Revision is re-seeing, not correcting"** becomes practice when students refactor early fragments with 7 weeks more knowledge and can see how their thinking has developed.

These concepts can be *taught* earlier but only *experienced* at scale.
