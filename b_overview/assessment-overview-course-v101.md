## Component Details

### 1. Final Portfolio (450 points)

**Due: Week 15**

Your portfolio is a **curated selection** from your semester's corpus (40-50 fragments). It demonstrates:
- Your best writing across multiple genres
- Evidence of sustained revision and development
- Metacognitive awareness of your writing process

**Portfolio Contents:**

| Element | Points | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| **Polished pieces** (3-4 pieces) | 300 | Developed, revised writing showing range and depth |
| **Introduction/Rationale** | 50 | Reflection on selections and semester learning |
| **Process documentation** | 50 | Dev logs, system maps, revision evidence |
| **Fragment inventory** | 25 | Complete list of fragments produced with metadata |
| **BEAM portfolio** | 25 | Citation work showing source engagement |

**What "polished" means:**
- **Developed**: More than single fragment; shows sustained engagement with idea
- **Revised**: Evidence of feedback integration and reconsideration
- **Edited**: Surface-level issues addressed (not necessarily perfect, but cared-for)
- **Purposeful**: Clear sense of audience, purpose, and rhetorical situation

**Why this is worth 56% of your grade:**

The portfolio is the **culminating demonstration** of your learning. It shows not just what you produced in one week, but what you developed across 15 weeks of consistent practice.

---

### 2. Peer Reviews (200 points)

**Six reviews across the semester @ 40 points each**

You'll complete **six formal peer reviews** through Eli Review, concentrated in Movement 2 (Weeks 4-7) with additional reviews in Movements 3-4.

**What you're evaluated on:**

| Criterion | What This Means |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Descriptive accuracy** | Do you accurately describe what the writer is doing? |
| **Evaluative helpfulness** | Do you identify strengths and areas for growth? |
| **Specific suggestions** | Do you offer concrete next steps? |
| **Tone** | Is your feedback respectful and constructive? |
| **Timeliness** | Did you complete review by deadline? |

**Each review also generates a "helpfulness" rating from the writer you reviewed.** Your overall peer review grade combines:
- Instructor evaluation of quality (60%)
- Helpfulness ratings from peers (40%)

**Why this is worth 25% of your grade:**

Peer review is **intellectual work**, not just a favor to classmates. Learning to read with writerly attention and articulate useful feedback are transferable skills valuable in any field.

**Justification**: [[assessment-overview-reasons-v101#Peer Review Assessment|Why peer review is graded]]

---

### 3. Participation (100 points)

**Ongoing throughout semester**

Participation means **active engagement** during class time, particularly in Writing, Peer Review, and Revision blocks. This isn't about being extroverted or speaking frequently—it's about being mentally present and doing the work.

**What counts as participation:**

- **Writing during W blocks**: Producing fragments, freewriting, drafting
- **Focused work during R blocks**: Processing feedback, revising, organizing
- **Engaged feedback during P blocks**: Thoughtful peer review work
- **Preparation**: Bringing materials, completing assigned reading
- **Presence**: Attending class, being on time, staying for full session

**What doesn't count:**
- Passive attendance (being physically present but mentally elsewhere)
- Off-task behavior (checking phone, doing other homework during blocks)
- Skipping blocks early or arriving late without reason

**How it's assessed:**

- **Weekly check-ins**: Brief observation of engagement each week
- **Self-assessment**: Mid-semester and final self-evaluation of participation
- **Holistic judgment**: Overall pattern matters more than any single day

**Why this is worth 13% of your grade:**

Most writing happens **during class time** in this course. Participation grade recognizes that showing up and engaging with the work is valuable labor.

**Justification**: [[assessment-overview-reasons-v101#Participation Assessment|Why participation is graded]]

---

### 4. Generative Writing (50 points)

**Ongoing throughout semester, assessed at three checkpoints**

This component recognizes **consistent fragment production**—the daily practice of building your corpus.

**Checkpoints:**

| Checkpoint | Target Fragment Count | Points |
|-----------|----------------------|--------|
| **End M1** (Week 3) | 8-12 fragments | 15 pts |
| **End M2** (Week 7) | 20-28 fragments | 15 pts |
| **End M3** (Week 11) | 30-42 fragments | 20 pts |

**What's assessed:**
- **Volume**: Are you hitting target production rates?
- **Evidence of practice**: Do fragments show engagement with course concepts?
- **Organization**: Can you locate and track your fragments?

**What's NOT assessed at checkpoints:**
- **Polish**: Fragments don't need to be polished; they're working material
- **Brilliance**: You're not graded on quality, just on consistent practice
- **Completion**: Fragments can be rough, exploratory, messy

**Why this is only 6% of your grade:**

Generative writing is **practice**, not performance. The low stakes encourage experimentation and risk-taking. **Quality** of your writing is assessed in the portfolio; this component recognizes **quantity** (consistent labor).

**Justification**: [[assessment-overview-reasons-v101#Generative Writing Assessment|Why generative writing is graded separately]]

---

## Milestone Assignments (Embedded in Portfolio)

In addition to the components above, you'll complete **three milestone assignments** that become part of your portfolio:

| Assignment | Due | Points | Purpose |
|-----------|-----|--------|---------|
| **Literacy Narrative + Constraint Experiment** | Week 3 (M1) | _Embedded in portfolio_ | Establish baseline, experiment with constraints |
| **Spec Document + Constraint Audit** | Week 7 (M2) | _Embedded in portfolio_ | Practice explicit constraint identification |
| **BEAM Portfolio** | Week 11 (M3) | _Embedded in portfolio_ | Demonstrate source engagement |

These aren't separately graded—they're **stepping stones** toward the final portfolio. They receive feedback but not points until they're included (potentially revised) in your final portfolio.

**Why milestone assignments don't have separate grades:**

Traditional courses grade each assignment separately, which creates **episodic closure** ("Essay 1 done, forget about it"). By embedding milestones in portfolio, we encourage **ongoing revision**—early work remains available for later development.

**Justification**: [[assessment-overview-reasons-v101#Milestone Assignments|Why milestones work differently here]]

## What This Grading System Values

### Process AND Product

- **Process**: Peer reviews (25%), Participation (13%), Generative writing (6%) = **44% of grade**
- **Product**: Final portfolio = **56% of grade**

This balance signals that **how you work** matters as much as **what you produce**.

### Accumulation Over Episodes

You're not graded on discrete essays that get finished and forgotten. You're graded on:
- **Building a corpus** (generative writing)
- **Engaging with peers** (peer reviews)  
- **Sustained practice** (participation)
- **Curating and developing** (portfolio)

### Labor That Compounds

Early work isn't wasted—it feeds into later work:
- M1 fragments can be developed in M4 portfolio
- M2 peer review skills make M3 revision more effective
- M3 BEAM portfolio becomes portfolio component
- Throughout semester, participation hours compound into writing skill

---

## Late Work and Revision Policy

### Peer Reviews
- **Deadline-dependent**: Reviews must be completed on time so writers can use feedback
- **No late peer reviews accepted** without prior arrangement
- **One free pass**: You may skip one peer review without penalty

### Generative Writing Checkpoints
- **Flexible deadlines**: Can submit up to 1 week late with no penalty
- **Content-focused**: We care that you hit the practice target, not the exact date

### Portfolio
- **Major deadline**: Due Week 15, final day of class
- **No extensions** without documented emergency
- **Drafts welcomed**: Can submit draft for feedback Week 14

**Revision philosophy:**

Because the portfolio is **selected and revised** from your corpus, **every fragment is always revisable** until the final portfolio deadline. "Revision" isn't a special stage—it's ongoing work throughout the semester.

## Questions About Assessment

**Q: If I write 50 fragments but my portfolio is weak, will the fragment count save my grade?**<br/>
**A:** Partially. You'll get full credit for generative writing (50 pts), but portfolio quality (450 pts) matters more. Think of fragments as **raw material**—you need them, but they're not the final product.

**Q: Can I revise my peer reviews after submitting them?**<br/>
**A:** No. Peer reviews have deadlines because writers need timely feedback. This is one area where timeliness matters.

**Q: What if I miss a lot of class due to illness?**<br/>
**A:** Participation is holistic—if you miss blocks, you can make up the work (produce fragments, complete dev logs) but can't replicate in-class engagement. Extended absences may require incomplete.

**Q: Do dev logs count toward my grade?**<br/>
**A:** They're part of your **portfolio** (process documentation component, 50 pts). Consistent dev logging shows metacognitive awareness and process engagement.

**Q: Can I do extra credit?**<br/>
**A:** No separate extra credit, but going above minimum (e.g., 50 fragments instead of 40, or exceptionally thorough peer reviews) strengthens your portfolio and participation grades.
