# Movement 4: Synthesis (Weeks 12-15)

## Movement Overview

**Core Question**: How do you transform accumulated fragments into a finished portfolio? What do you select, how do you polish, and what story do you tell about your process?

**Metaphor**: Composing the final product. In Movement 4, you're *publishing*—selecting from your corpus, polishing chosen pieces, assembling evidence of your process, and articulating what you've learned for transfer to future contexts.

**Duration**: 4 weeks (Weeks 12-15) | ~23 blocks

**Mode Emphasis**: R-heavy (revision dominates, minimal new writing, strategic peer feedback)

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of Movement 4, you will be able to:

- **Select strategically** from your corpus to assemble a coherent portfolio
- **Polish writing** for external readers through sustained revision work
- **Document your process** by analyzing your own writing development
- **Articulate transfer** by identifying principles generalizable beyond this course
- **Publish** final work that demonstrates both product (polished writing) and process (labor evidence)
- **Complete your corpus** with 36-52 fragments total
- **Reflect metacognitively** on your growth as a writer

**Key Principle Culminated**: **Constraint Sequencing as Strategic Choice**—You'll design your own constraint sequence for a future writing project, demonstrating understanding of *when* constraints arrive, not just *what* they are.

---

## What You'll Be Doing

### Week-by-Week Focus

| Week | Primary Activity | Milestone |
|------|-------|-----------|
| **Week 12** | Documented Inquiry drafting, portfolio selection begins | Eli Review cycle, Process Archaeology start |
| **Week 13** | Polish and revision, optional advanced tools demo | Instructor feedback on portfolios |
| **Week 14** | Presentations (no traditional class meetings) | Student presentations |
| **Week 15** | Final portfolio assembly, Transfer Proposal | Portfolio submission |

### Typical Week Structure

Movement 4 is revision-intensive with minimal new generation:

**Example week pattern**:
- **Blocks 1-2** (50 min): Revision (R) — Polish selected fragments
- **Blocks 3-4** (50 min): Revision (R) — Process documentation work
- **Blocks 5-6** (50 min): Revision (R) or Writing (W) — Portfolio assembly

**Homework**: Final readings + portfolio work + presentation prep

---

## Key Activities & Assignments

### Portfolio Selection (Weeks 12-13)

**Challenge**: You have 30-42 fragments. Your final portfolio requires 4-6 polished pieces. How do you choose?

**Selection criteria**:
- Which fragments represent your strongest thinking?
- Which fragments connect to form a coherent inquiry?
- Which fragments show range (different topics/approaches)?
- Which fragments demonstrate growth (early vs. late work)?
- Which fragments are worth the revision effort to polish?

**Process**:
1. Review your corpus inventory and content map (from M3)
2. Identify 8-10 candidate fragments
3. Narrow to 4-6 based on criteria above
4. Plan revision work for each selected piece

**Purpose**: Selection *is* composition. Your portfolio tells a story about your inquiry, and which pieces you include/exclude shapes that story.

### Documented Inquiry (Due Week 15, in portfolio)

**Assignment**: Write a polished piece (1500-2000 words) that demonstrates sustained inquiry into a question that matters to you. This piece should:

- Pose a genuine question (not one with obvious answer)
- Engage multiple sources using BEAM and SEAR strategies
- Show development of thinking (not just argument confirmation)
- Conclude with further questions or refined understanding (not "solved" answers)

**Format**: Essay, but could take alternative forms (Q&A, annotated examples, epistolary exchange) if appropriate to your inquiry

**Sources**: Draw from your BEAM Portfolio and additional research as needed

**Purpose**: Documented Inquiry demonstrates your ability to work with sources, develop ideas over time, and communicate inquiry process to readers.

### Process Archaeology (Due Week 15, in portfolio)

**Assignment**: Analyze your own writing process by "excavating" evidence from your semester's work. This piece (1000-1500 words) should:

- Examine your dev logs, system maps, version histories
- Identify patterns in your process (when/how you write best)
- Trace how fragments developed and connected
- Compare early and late work to show growth
- Make claims about your process supported by evidence

**Format**: Analytical essay with embedded examples from your work

**Purpose**: Process Archaeology makes the invisible labor of writing visible. It teaches metacognitive analysis: seeing patterns in your own work that you couldn't see while doing it.

### Transfer Proposal (Due Week 15, in portfolio)

**Assignment**: Design a constraint sequence for a future writing project outside this course. This short piece (500-750 words) should:

- Describe a project you'll write (for another class, work, personal)
- Specify constraints you'll face or impose
- Sequence when constraints should arrive (and justify the timing)
- Explain how this sequence enables rather than restricts

**Format**: Spec document with rationale

**Purpose**: Transfer Proposal demonstrates understanding of constraint sequencing as transferable principle. You're not just learning to write in this class—you're learning *how* to approach future writing situations strategically.

### Reflective Cover Letter (Due Week 15, in portfolio)

**Assignment**: Write a letter to readers of your portfolio (instructor, future self) that:

- Introduces your portfolio and its contents
- Argues for your grade based on evidence
- Reflects on growth and learning
- Connects to course learning outcomes

**Format**: 2-3 pages, professional letter format

**Purpose**: Cover letter synthesizes your understanding of your own work. It's both reflection and argument—you're making a case for your learning.

### Presentations (Week 14)

All class time Week 14 is devoted to student presentations. You'll share:
- Your Documented Inquiry (abbreviated version or key insight)
- One surprising discovery from Process Archaeology
- Your Transfer Proposal (what you'll apply beyond this course)

**Time**: 8-10 minutes per student  
**Format**: Informal, conversational (not formal speech)  
**Purpose**: Practice public sharing of work; hear peers' inquiries

---

## Six Moves Vocabulary: Publish

Movement 4 focuses on the final move: **Publish**.

**Publish** = Generate outputs from accumulated material for external readers

**What it looks like**:
- Selecting fragments from your corpus to include in portfolio
- Polishing writing for readers beyond yourself
- Assembling portfolio as coherent package
- Presenting work publicly (presentations)
- Submitting final portfolio (publication to instructor/institution)

**Why it matters**: All prior moves (Capture, Classify, Route, Distill, Connect) served *process*—they helped you generate, organize, and consolidate. Publish serves *product*—it creates something others can read, use, and respond to.

**Moves you've learned**: Capture (M1), Classify (M2), Route (M2), Distill (M3), Connect (M3)  
**Complete cycle**: You now have vocabulary for entire writing workflow from initial capture to final publication.

---

## Fragment Target Trajectory

By end of M4 (Week 15): **36-52 fragments total** (6-10 new fragments in M4, but emphasis on polish not generation)

**Production rate in M4**: Slows significantly (writing now focused on revision and assembly). Some "new" fragments might be refined versions of earlier work or process reflections rather than entirely new material.

**Quality shift**: M4 fragments (if any) are polished and publication-ready. Most M4 work involves taking earlier fragments and bringing them to final quality.

---

## Technology & Organization

### Week 12: Portfolio Assembly Logistics (embedded touch)

Brief 10-minute walkthrough during revision block:
- How to export feedback records from Eli Review
- How to pull version history from OneDrive
- How to organize final portfolio folder structure
- What format for submission (PDF, folder structure, etc.)

### Week 13: Optional Advanced Tools Demo (T6)

This is *aspirational*—showing what tools exist beyond this course that students might grow into:
- Voyant Tools for corpus analysis
- OneNote advanced features for research management
- VIRENS system demonstration (the full suite)
- Zotero advanced features (annotation sharing, group libraries)

**Purpose**: Not to learn these tools now, but to know they exist and what's possible as you continue writing.

---

## Final Portfolio Components

Your final portfolio (worth 450 points, 45% of course grade) must include:

1. **Documented Inquiry** (polished piece, 1500-2000 words)
2. **Process Archaeology** (analytical piece, 1000-1500 words)
3. **4-6 additional polished fragments** (selected and revised from your corpus)
4. **Transfer Proposal** (constraint sequence for future project, 500-750 words)
5. **Reflective Cover Letter** (2-3 pages)
6. **Process Evidence** (selected dev log entries, system maps, version history samples)

**Organization**: Clear folder structure with labeled sections

**Due**: End of Week 15 (specific date in syllabus)

---

## What Success Looks Like

By the end of Movement 4, you should have:

✓ **A complete final portfolio** meeting all requirements  
✓ **Polished writing** demonstrating sustained revision work  
✓ **Process documentation** showing your labor and growth  
✓ **Transfer articulation** connecting course work to future writing  
✓ **Metacognitive awareness** of your development as writer  
✓ **Presentation experience** sharing work publicly  
✓ **Corpus of 36-52 fragments** accumulated across semester

**Most important**: You should feel like you've *accomplished something*—not just completed assignments but built a body of work, documented your process, and learned principles you can apply beyond this course.

## Common Questions

**Q**: How is final portfolio graded if individual pieces were already graded?  
**A**: Portfolio is graded *holistically* on selection, revision quality, coherence, and process documentation. Individual assignment grades (Literacy Narrative, Spec Doc, BEAM Portfolio) counted earlier. Final portfolio shows how you've revised, connected, and reflected on all work.

**Q**: Can I include fragments that weren't graded during the semester?  
**A**: Yes! Any fragment from your corpus can be revised and included. Some of your best work might be pieces that didn't fit earlier milestones.

**Q**: What if my Documented Inquiry doesn't "answer" the question?  
**A**: That's fine—encouraged, even. Documented Inquiry is about showing sustained thinking, not providing final answers. Concluding with refined questions or next steps demonstrates genuine intellectual work.

**Q**: How detailed should Process Archaeology be?  
**A**: Detailed enough to make specific claims with evidence. Don't just say "my process improved"—show it by comparing early dev log entries to late ones, or by analyzing version history of a specific fragment.

**Q**: What if I don't have a future writing project for Transfer Proposal?  
**A**: Think broadly: lab reports for science class, application essays, workplace documentation, personal projects. Any writing counts. The goal is demonstrating you understand constraint sequencing as transferable principle.

**Q**: Are presentations graded?  
**A**: Presentations fall under "participation" grade. The goal is sharing and listening, not polished performance.
