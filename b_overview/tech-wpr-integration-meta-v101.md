# Tech Instruction Integration with W/P/R Rhythm

> [!info] Instructor Guide
> **Component**: Meta
> **Track**: Instructor-facing (semester integration map)
> **Purpose**: Shows how tech instruction blocks intersect with Writing (W), Peer Review (P), and Revision (R) rhythm

---

## Overview

This document maps tech instruction blocks onto the 15-week semester structure, showing when they occur relative to W/P/R activities.

**Key insight**: Tech instruction isn't a separate category competing with W/P/R—it should be *embedded* in W/P/R activities wherever possible. Students learn Eli Review by doing a peer review (P block). Students learn folder structure by saving their writing (end of W block).

---

## Time Budget Reconciliation

From course design:

| Allocation | Blocks |
|------------|--------|
| Total semester blocks | 90 |
| Subtractions (holiday, flex, conference, etc.) | -28 |
| **Available for instruction** | **62** |

**Tech-specific blocks**: 8 total (6 tech instruction + 2 library session)

These 8 blocks are part of the 28 subtracted from the 62 available blocks.

---

## Tech Instruction Block Allocation

| Block | Week | Activity | Duration | Integration |
|-------|------|----------|----------|-------------|
| **T1** | 2 | Index cards + folder setup | 25 min | After first W block; students have material to organize |
| **T2** | 2 | Eli Review quick intro (ungraded) | 25 min | Tech familiarization only; hands-on |
| **T3** | 5 | Zotero basics (library, part 1) | 25 min | When source work begins; coordinated with library |
| **T4** | 5 | Zotero practice (library, part 2) | 25 min | Immediately following T3 |
| **T5** | 8 | "What You're Automating" | 25 min | Start of M3; digital transfer |
| **T6** | 13 | Optional: Advanced tools demo | 25 min | During M4; aspirational not required |

**Touch reminders** (5-10 min, absorbed into other blocks):
- Week 6: Zotero check-in (during W block)
- Week 7: Eli helpfulness discussion (during R block)
- Week 10: Folder organization check (during R block)
- Week 11: Process documentation review (during R block)
- Week 12: Portfolio assembly logistics (during R block)

*Touch reminders are absorbed into W/R blocks, not counted separately.*

---

## Key Integration Principles

1. **Tech follows content.** Don't teach tools in the abstract—teach them when students need them for real work.

2. **Practice immediately.** Every T block should be followed by a W, P, or R block that uses what was just taught.

3. **Familiarize before stakes.** Eli intro in Week 2 (ungraded) → first graded cycle in Week 5. Students know the interface before performance matters.

4. **Touches reinforce, not introduce.** Touch reminders assume students already learned the tool; they address drift and troubleshoot.

5. **Scale determines timing.** Index cards in Week 2 (small corpus), digital transfer in Week 8 (large corpus), advanced tools in Week 13 (mastery context).

6. **Eli embeds in P blocks.** Once introduced, Eli Review isn't separate from peer review—it *is* peer review.

---

## MOVEMENT 1: SURFACING (Weeks 1-3, ~12 blocks)
*Emphasis: W-heavy (expansion, capture, freewriting)*

### Week 1 (6 blocks)

| Block | Type | Activity |
|-------|------|----------|
| 1 | — | Syllabus review, course introduction |
| 2 | W | Envelope exercise begins |
| 3 | W | Envelope freewriting continues |
| 4 | W | First fragment capture |
| 5 | W | Fragment development |
| 6 | W | Fragment development |

**Tech**: None yet. Students write by hand or in any word processor. Index cards mentioned but not required.

---

### Week 2 (6 blocks)

| Block | Type | Activity |
|-------|------|----------|
| 1 | W | Freewriting / fragment work |
| 2 | **T1** | **Index cards + OneDrive folder setup** |
| 3 | **T2** | **Eli Review quick intro (hands-on familiarization)** |
| 4 | W | Writing with new systems (practice saving/naming) |
| 5 | W | Fragment development |
| 6 | W | Fragment development |

**Tech integration**: T1 follows a W block so students have material to organize. T2 is pure tech familiarization—students submit something small, see the interface, experience the cycle once. This is **ungraded**; the goal is "know where the buttons are" not "understand the pedagogy." The next W blocks (4-6) practice the new folder conventions.

**Eli quick intro scope**: Submit a fragment → get assigned to review 1-2 peers → write brief feedback → see what feedback you received → done. No helpfulness ratings, no revision planning, no analytics discussion. Just touch the system.

---

### Week 3 (6 blocks)

| Block | Type | Activity |
|-------|------|----------|
| 1 | W | Fragment development toward Literacy Narrative |
| 2 | R | Self-revision of envelope material |
| 3 | W | Compression exercise (300→200→100 words) |
| 4 | P | Peer feedback on compression (in-class, informal) |
| 5 | R | Revision based on peer feedback |
| 6 | W | Literacy Narrative draft completion |

**Tech**: Students practice folder system independently. Dev log started.

**M1 fragment count**: 8-12 fragments generated

---

## MOVEMENT 2: NAMING (Weeks 4-7, ~20 blocks)
*Emphasis: Balanced W-P-R cycling, introducing sources and structured feedback*

### Week 4 (6 blocks)

| Block | Type | Activity |
|-------|------|----------|
| 1 | W | Begin source-based writing (responding to Salvatori or course reading) |
| 2 | W | Continue source-based fragment development |
| 3 | P | In-class peer feedback on source-based fragments (informal, prep for Eli) |
| 4 | R | Revise Literacy Narrative for submission |
| 5 | W | Continue source-based writing |
| 6 | I | Instructor feedback on Literacy Narratives |

**Tech**: No new tech this week. Students practice folder system and index cards independently. Source-based writing begins but Zotero instruction comes next week—for now, students can cite informally or use whatever citation habits they have. This creates a "before Zotero" baseline.

---

### Week 5 (6 blocks)

| Block | Type | Activity |
|-------|------|----------|
| 1 | **T3** | **Zotero basics (library session, part 1)** |
| 2 | **T4** | **Zotero practice (library session, part 2)** |
| 3 | W | Source-based fragment with Zotero citation (immediate practice) |
| 4 | W | Spec Document brainstorming |
| 5 | **P** | **First graded Eli Review cycle: Literacy Narrative draft** |
| 6 | R | Process Eli feedback, begin revision planning |

**Tech integration**: Library session (T3-T4) opens the week, establishing Zotero before deeper source work. W block (3) immediately practices citation. The first **graded** Eli cycle (block 5) builds on Week 2's familiarization—students now understand the interface and can focus on the feedback itself. R block (6) processes feedback using the full model: assess feedback, rate helpfulness, sequence into revision plan.

**Why this sequence**: Students have touched Eli (Week 2), written source-based fragments without formal citation (Week 4), and now learn proper citation (Week 5) just as they enter the feedback cycle for their Literacy Narrative. The tools arrive when needed.

---

### Week 6 (6 blocks)

| Block | Type | Activity |
|-------|------|----------|
| 1 | **W (touch)** | Fragment work + **(Zotero check-in: 5-10 min)** |
| 2 | W | Spec Document development |
| 3 | P | Eli Review: Spec Document draft |
| 4 | R | Revision based on Eli feedback |
| 5 | W | Constraint Audit brainstorming |
| 6 | I | Instructor feedback on Spec Documents |

**Tech integration**: Zotero touch embedded in W block—quick check that students are adding sources correctly, troubleshoot common issues (plugin not working, tags not appearing).

---

### Week 7 (6 blocks)

| Block | Type | Activity |
|-------|------|----------|
| 1 | W | Constraint Audit drafting |
| 2 | **R (touch)** | Revision work + **(Eli helpfulness discussion: 10 min)** |
| 3 | P | Eli Review: Constraint Audit draft |
| 4 | R | Revision based on feedback |
| 5 | W | BEAM practice: categorizing sources |
| 6 | R | Final revision of M2 assignments |

**Tech integration**: Eli helpfulness discussion embedded in R block—review analytics, discuss what makes feedback helpful, show examples of highly-rated reviews.

**M2 fragment count**: 12-16 fragments generated (cumulative: 20-28)

---

## MOVEMENT 3: OPERATING AT SCALE (Weeks 8-11, ~16 blocks)
*Emphasis: W+R heavy (consolidation, corpus management, scale)*

### Week 8 (6 blocks)

| Block | Type | Activity |
|-------|------|----------|
| 1 | **T5** | **"What You're Automating" — digital transfer session** |
| 2 | W | Corpus inventory: what do you have? |
| 3 | W | Develop fragments for BEAM Portfolio |
| 4 | R | Revise fragments based on BEAM categories |
| 5 | W | Continue BEAM Portfolio development |
| 6 | I | Instructor feedback on Constraint Audits |

**Tech integration**: T5 teaches digital transfer explicitly. Students see how card organization (physical sorting) maps to folder structure and search. W block (2) immediately practices: students inventory their corpus, identify gaps, plan next fragments.

**Why Week 8**: Corpus at ~25 fragments; scale now justifies digital organization. Earlier transfer would be premature (not enough material). Later transfer means students drown in unsorted fragments.

---

### Week 9 (6 blocks) — CONFERENCE WEEK

| Block | Type | Activity |
|-------|------|----------|
| 1-6 | — | Individual conferences (15 min each) |

**Tech**: No new instruction. Conferences allow 1-on-1 troubleshooting of folder organization, Zotero issues, Eli Review patterns.

---

### Week 10 (6 blocks)

| Block | Type | Activity |
|-------|------|----------|
| 1 | W | BEAM Portfolio continued |
| 2 | **R (touch)** | Revision work + **(Folder organization check: 5-10 min)** |
| 3 | P | Eli Review: BEAM Portfolio draft |
| 4 | R | Revision based on feedback |
| 5 | W | Fragment consolidation |
| 6 | I | Instructor feedback on BEAM Portfolios |

**Tech integration**: Folder organization touch embedded in R block—check that naming conventions haven't drifted, remind students about status codes in filenames.

---

### Week 11 (6 blocks)

| Block | Type | Activity |
|-------|------|----------|
| 1 | R | BEAM Portfolio revision |
| 2 | **R (touch)** | Revision work + **(Process documentation review: 5-10 min)** |
| 3 | W | Begin final portfolio planning |
| 4 | R | Corpus review: what to polish? |
| 5 | W | Fragment development |
| 6 | R | Revision work |

**Tech integration**: Process documentation touch embedded in R block—remind students that dev logs count toward participation grade, review examples of effective dev log entries.

**M3 fragment count**: 10-12 fragments generated (cumulative: 30-40)

---

## MOVEMENT 4: SYNTHESIS (Weeks 12-15, ~12 blocks)
*Emphasis: R-heavy (polish, selection, portfolio assembly)*

### Week 12 (6 blocks)

| Block | Type | Activity |
|-------|------|----------|
| 1 | **R (touch)** | Portfolio planning + **(Portfolio assembly logistics: 10-15 min)** |
| 2 | R | Select fragments for portfolio |
| 3 | W | Polish selected fragments |
| 4 | P | Eli Review: Portfolio draft sections |
| 5 | R | Revision based on feedback |
| 6 | R | Continue portfolio assembly |

**Tech integration**: Portfolio assembly logistics touch embedded in R block—explain portfolio structure, demonstrate selecting from corpus, clarify what goes in portfolio vs. what stays in corpus as process documentation.

---

### Week 13 (6 blocks)

| Block | Type | Activity |
|-------|------|----------|
| 1 | **T6** | **Optional: Advanced tools demo (Voyant, OneNote, Obsidian)** |
| 2 | R | Portfolio revision |
| 3 | R | Process reflection essay |
| 4 | W | Final fragment development |
| 5 | R | Portfolio polish |
| 6 | R | Final revision work |

**Tech integration**: T6 is aspirational, not required. Show students tools they might "grow into" after ENGL 101. Voyant for corpus analysis, OneNote for advanced digital organization, Obsidian for bidirectional linking (mention it connects to VIRENS principles). Emphasize: "You don't need these now, but if you continue writing, these are options."

**M4 fragment count**: 5-10 fragments generated (cumulative: 35-50)

---

### Week 14 (6 blocks)

| Block | Type | Activity |
|-------|------|----------|
| 1-6 | — | Student presentations (portfolio showcases) |

**Tech**: No new instruction. Students may use tech to present (e.g., share screen, show folder structure, demo Eli Review analytics).

---

### Week 15 (6 blocks)

| Block | Type | Activity |
|-------|------|----------|
| 1 | R | Final portfolio revisions |
| 2 | R | Process reflection polish |
| 3 | I | Final portfolio submission to Canvas |
| 4 | — | Course evaluations |
| 5 | — | Flex / buffer |
| 6 | — | Flex / buffer |

**Tech**: No new instruction. Students submit final portfolio via Canvas (includes polished fragments + dev logs + system maps + reflection essay).

---

## Questions Resolved by This Design

**Q**: When should Eli orientation happen?  
**A**: Week 2 as quick familiarization (ungraded). First graded cycle in Week 5. Students have 3 weeks between "touch the buttons" and "performance matters."

**Q**: When should library session be placed?  
**A**: Week 5 to align with source work intensification. Creates "before Zotero" (Week 4) and "after Zotero" (Week 5+) comparison.

**Q**: Do we need conference week?  
**A**: Yes. Confirmed as needed "catch your breath" gap. Individual meetings allow tech troubleshooting and prevent mid-semester burnout.

**Q**: When should digital transfer happen?  
**A**: Week 8 when corpus hits ~25 fragments. Earlier is premature (not enough scale), later is overwhelming (too much to transfer).

**Q**: Should there be a final tech touch in M4?  
**A**: Yes. Portfolio assembly logistics touch in Week 12 clarifies expectations and prevents confusion about what belongs in final portfolio.
