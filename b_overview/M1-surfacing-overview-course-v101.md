# Movement 1: Surfacing (Weeks 1-3)

## Movement Overview

**Core Question**: What ideas, experiences, and patterns do you already carry that you haven't yet put into words?

**Metaphor**: Mining raw material. In Movement 1, you're excavating—bringing hidden thoughts and experiences to the surface, capturing them before they disappear, and beginning to accumulate a body of written material you can work with later in the semester.

**Duration**: 3 weeks (Weeks 1-3) | ~18 blocks

**Mode Emphasis**: Writing-heavy (W-W-W-W-W-W pattern most weeks)

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of Movement 1, you will be able to:

- **Capture ideas quickly** without self-censoring or editing prematurely
- **Generate substantial text** (300-500 words) in a single sitting through freewriting
- **Develop fragments** from raw material into focused pieces with claims and evidence
- **Recognize your own writing processes** by observing what happens when you write
- **Begin building your corpus** (target: 8-12 fragments by end of Week 3)
- **Use basic organizational systems** (index cards, folder structure, file naming)

**Key Principle Introduced**: **Iteration**—Sloppy, looping, recursive writing processes are normal and productive. You're not trying to write perfectly on the first try; you're trying to get material onto the page that you can work with.

---

## What You'll Be Doing

### Week-by-Week Focus

| Week | Primary Activity | Milestone |
|------|------------------|-----------|
| **Week 1** | Envelope exercise, freewriting, first fragments | Begin corpus accumulation |
| **Week 2** | Fragment development, organizational systems setup | Tech intro (index cards + folders) |
| **Week 3** | Compression work (300→200→100), Literacy Narrative | Complete Literacy Narrative draft |

### Typical Week Structure

Most weeks in Movement 1 follow this pattern:

**Block 1-2** (50 min): Freewriting or fragment generation  
**Block 3-4** (50 min): Fragment development or expansion work  
**Block 5-6** (50 min): More fragment work or activity completion

**Home**work**: Reading (40-60 pages/week) + independent fragment work

---

## Key Activities & Assignments

### The Envelope Exercise (Week 1, Blocks 2-3)

You'll receive an envelope at the start of Week 1. Don't open it until instructed. When you do open it, you'll use what's inside as a prompt for sustained freewriting. This exercise teaches you to:

- Write without stopping or editing
- Generate substantial text quickly
- Work with found constraints
- Transform raw writing into developed fragments

The envelope returns to you at the end of Week 3, creating a "before and after" comparison.

### Daily Fragment Production

**Target**: 3-4 fragments per week (8-12 total by end of M1)

**Fragment definition**: One claim with supporting evidence, typically 150-400 words. Think of it as one substantial paragraph to one page.

**What counts as a fragment**:
- A memory with analysis
- An observation with interpretation
- A response to a reading
- An idea you're developing
- A claim you're testing

**What you're learning**: To write regularly, accumulate material, and separate generation (getting words down) from editing (making them better).

### Literacy Narrative with Constraint Experiment (Due Week 3)

**Assignment**: Write about your own history with reading, writing, and composing. Then compress that narrative: first to 200 words, then to 100 words.

**Purpose**: 
- Practice expansion (generating material freely)
- Practice compression (identifying what's essential)
- Reflect on your own literacy experiences
- Experience how constraints change what you write

**Format**: 1000 words minimum for initial narrative + compressed versions

**Assessment**: 50 points (Movement 1 milestone)

---

## Six Moves Vocabulary: Capture

Movement 1 focuses on the first move in the writing process cycle: **Capture**.

**Capture** = Get the idea out immediately before it disappears

**What it looks like**:
- Freewriting without editing
- Jotting notes on index cards
- Writing fragments as ideas occur
- Not worrying about organization yet

**Why it matters**: Ideas are fragile. If you don't capture them quickly, they vanish. Capture gives you material to work with. Everything else comes later.

**Other moves you'll learn**: Classify (M2), Route (M2), Distill (M3), Connect (M3), Publish (M4)

---

## Fragment Target Trajectory

By end of M1 (Week 3): **8-12 fragments**

This is the foundation. In Movement 2, you'll build to 20-28 fragments. By Week 12, you'll have 40-50 fragments—a substantial corpus to work with for your final portfolio.

**Don't panic if you're behind**. The goal is consistent production, not perfection. Some weeks you'll write more, some less. What matters is developing the habit.

---

## Technology & Organization

### Week 1: Just Write

No special tools required. Write by hand, in a word processor, in notes on your phone—whatever lets you capture ideas quickly.

### Week 2: Systems Setup

**Block 2 (T1)**: Index cards and folder structure
- How to use index cards for idea capture
- How to set up your OneDrive portfolio folder
- File naming convention: `YYYY-MM-DD-topic-slug-status.docx`

**Block 3 (T2)**: Eli Review intro (ungraded familiarization)
- Touch the buttons, see the interface
- Submit something small, give/receive feedback
- Goal: know where things are, not master the system yet

### Week 3: Independent Practice

Use your organizational systems as you write. Don't worry about getting them perfect—just start building habits.

---

## What Success Looks Like

By the end of Movement 1, you should have:

✓ **A growing collection** of 8-12 fragments in your OneDrive folder  
✓ **Experience with freewriting** and rapid text generation  
✓ **A completed Literacy Narrative** that demonstrates expansion and compression  
✓ **Basic organizational habits** (saving files, naming consistently)  
✓ **Comfort with messiness** in early-stage writing  
✓ **An understanding** that writing is accumulation, not isolated episodes

**Most important**: You should feel like you're building something, accumulating material week by week, rather than starting over with each assignment.

## Common Questions

**Q**: What if my fragments aren't very good?  
**A**: That's normal and expected in M1. You're generating raw material, not polished prose. Quality comes later through revision. Right now, focus on *getting words down*.

**Q**: Can I write about anything, or does it have to connect to readings?  
**A**: In M1, write about whatever helps you generate material. Some fragments will respond to readings; others might be personal observations or experiences. By M2, you'll start connecting more deliberately to course readings.

**Q**: How do I know when a fragment is "done"?  
**A**: In M1, a fragment is done when it contains one claim with supporting evidence and is 150-400 words. Don't overthink it. If it has substance and could stand alone as a paragraph, it counts.

**Q**: What if I don't like freewriting?  
**A**: That's okay. Freewriting is one technique for rapid generation. If it doesn't work for you, find other ways to capture ideas quickly—bullet lists, voice memos you transcribe, conversation transcripts. The goal is *capture*, not any specific method.

---

## Transition to Movement 2

By Week 4, you'll have raw material accumulated. Movement 2 shifts focus from *expansion* to *classification*: learning to sort, categorize, route, and develop what you've captured. You'll also begin working with sources systematically and receiving structured peer feedback.

**Movement 1's gift to Movement 2**: A corpus to work with, rather than starting from blank page.
