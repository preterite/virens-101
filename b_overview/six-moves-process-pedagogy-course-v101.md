## The Big Picture

Writing involves two kinds of work happening at the same time:

1. **Process** describes what _you do_ as a writer
2. **Six moves** describe what happens to _your material_ as you work

These aren't competing explanations—they're two levels of description happening simultaneously. You're always doing process work, and your material is always moving through the six moves.

## Writing Process: What You Do

You've probably heard some version of "the writing process" before. Here's how we'll use it:

| Stage | What It Means |
|-------|---------------|
| **Generative writing** | Getting ideas into words—freewriting, brainstorming, exploring |
| **Drafting** | Building larger structures from fragments, sustained composing |
| **Seeking feedback** | Sharing work-in-progress, receiving responses from readers |
| **Revising** | Large-scale changes to ideas, structure, argument—re-seeing the work |
| **Editing** | Style-level work—sentence refinement, voice, citation formatting |
| **Proofreading** | Surface-level polish—typos, mechanical errors, final corrections |
| **Publishing** | Sharing with intended audience—submitting, posting, sending |
| **Reflecting** | Looking back—what worked, what didn't, what to do differently |

**Key principles:**
- This isn't a straight line. You loop back, skip around, revisit stages.
- Don't edit while you're generating. Let ideas flow first.
- Revising (big changes) comes before editing (small changes). Don't polish sentences you might cut.
- Reflection isn't optional—it's how you learn from what you did.

## Six Moves: What Your Material Does

While you're doing process work, your material is moving through a system:

| Move | What Happens |
|------|--------------|
| **Capture** | An idea leaves your head and becomes material you can work with |
| **Classify** | You identify what kind of thing it is—a claim, a question, a source note, a fragment |
| **Route** | You send it where it belongs—a folder, a draft, a peer reviewer |
| **Distill** | You extract the essential insight, making it denser and clearer |
| **Connect** | You link it to other ideas—your own fragments, sources, peer work |
| **Publish** | It enters circulation—submitted, shared, part of the conversation |

**Key principles:**
- Capture always comes first. You can't work on what you haven't captured.
- Classify and connect can happen multiple times as you learn more.
- Route happens at many moments, not just when you submit.
- Publish is a beginning, not an ending—once published, ideas circulate and get used by others.

## How They Work Together

Think of it this way:

> **Process is your labor. Six moves describe how that labor builds into something you can reuse.**

A single writing session involves both. Say you're drafting an essay:

- **Process level**: You're _drafting_—building structure, developing ideas
- **Six moves level**: Your fragments are being _routed_ into the draft and _connected_ to each other

Or say you're getting feedback from a peer:

- **Process level**: You're _seeking feedback_—reading responses, deciding what to use
- **Six moves level**: That feedback gets _captured_ (you write down what they said), _classified_ (is this about structure? style? evidence?), and eventually _connected_ to your revision plans

## The Mill and the Store

Here's a metaphor that might help:

Imagine a **mill** (where transformation happens) and a **store** (where things accumulate).

- **The mill** is where you work on material—capturing, classifying, routing, distilling, connecting, publishing
- **The store** is your corpus—all the fragments, drafts, notes, and sources you've accumulated
- **Process** describes you moving between mill and store: pulling from what you've saved, working on it, depositing new material back

The goal is to build a store that keeps growing. Nothing is wasted. Today's rough fragment might become next month's polished paragraph. This semester's exploratory writing might become next year's thesis.

---

## Why Both Frameworks?

**Process helps you know what to do next.** "I've been generating—now I need to draft." "I've revised—now I can edit."

**Six moves help you see where your material is.** "This idea is captured but not classified." "These fragments are distilled but not connected."

Together, they give you two ways to diagnose what's happening and decide what to do:

| If you're stuck... | Process question | Six moves question |
|-------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Not making progress | What stage am I in? Should I move to the next one? | Where is my material? What move would help? |
| Overwhelmed | Am I trying to do too many stages at once? | Do I have too much uncaptured or unclassified material? |
| Lost | Have I skipped a stage (like feedback before revising)? | Have I skipped a move (like routing fragments before connecting)? |

## What This Means for You

In this course, you'll:

1. **Build a corpus** of 40-50 fragments over the semester. That's the _store_ growing.
2. **Practice each process stage** deliberately, in supported environments.
3. **Name what you're doing** using both vocabularies—"I'm revising" AND "I'm connecting."
4. **Develop habits** that transfer beyond this course. The six moves work whether you're writing an essay, organizing a project, or building anything that accumulates over time.

The frameworks aren't rules to follow perfectly. They're tools for understanding what you're doing—and for figuring out what to do when things get hard.

## Quick Reference

### Process Stages (What You Do)

```
Generate → Draft → Seek Feedback → Revise → Edit → Proofread → Publish → Reflect
                        ↑__________________________________|
                               (loops back as needed)
```

### Six Moves (What Your Material Does)

```
Capture → Classify → Route → Distill → Connect → Publish
              ↑_______|          ↑________|
            (reclassify)      (reconnect)
```

### The Relationship
- Process describes your **labor**
- Six moves describe how labor becomes **capital** you can reuse
- Both happen simultaneously
- Both are recursive, not linear
