## Design Philosophy

### Core Pedagogical Principle

Movement 4 operationalizes **portfolio as curated corpus** rather than collection of best papers. Where traditional composition portfolios ask students to select "best work," M4 portfolios ask students to demonstrate *inquiry* (Documented Inquiry), *process analysis* (Process Archaeology), *transfer* (Transfer Proposal), and *selection judgment* (which fragments to polish and include).

The design treats the final portfolio not as summation but as *argument*: through selection, organization, and reflection, students make claims about their learning, growth, and transferable knowledge. This shifts agency from instructor (who evaluates) to student (who argues for evaluation, backed by evidence).

The "R-heavy" rhythm (revision dominates) reflects the cognitive and affective work of bringing writing to publication quality. Students need sustained time for polish, not just quick fixes. The reduced emphasis on generation (W blocks) acknowledges completion phase: students have accumulated enough material and now must *finish* rather than *start* more work.

### Theoretical Grounding

**Portfolio Theory as Argument** (Yancey [[@yancey1998refle]], Huot): Portfolios are not just collections but *arguments* about a writer's abilities. The cover letter functions as thesis statement; selected pieces function as evidence. M4 teaches students to construct this argument deliberately, not just comply with portfolio requirements.

**Transfer-Focused Writing Instruction** (Yancey, Robertson, Taczak): Transfer research shows that explicit attention to transfer—naming principles, designing for application—increases likelihood students will apply learning beyond first context. M4's Transfer Proposal makes this explicit: students must articulate *how* course principles work in new contexts, not just *that* they learned them.

**Process Documentation as Evidence** (Anson, Shipka): Multimodal composition and process pedagogy both emphasize that labor should be *visible* and *valued*, not just final products. M4's Process Archaeology treats process documentation as analyzable data, not just proof of compliance.

**Concepts Applied:**
- Portfolio as argument requiring evidence
- Transfer as teachable when made explicit
- Process documentation as analyzable corpus
- Selection as compositional act (curation)
- Publication as distinct phase (not just submission)

## Learning Objectives

### Why These Objectives?

Movement 4 objectives target **synthesis** and **transfer**—the highest cognitive levels in Bloom's taxonomy. Students must evaluate their own work (selection), create new compositions from existing material (assembly), and apply principles to novel contexts (transfer). These are culminating skills that require all prior learning (M1-M3) as foundation.

The objectives emphasize **metacognitive reflection** as culminating intellectual work. Process Archaeology asks students to analyze patterns they produced but couldn't see while producing them. This meta-level analysis requires distance from the work—possible at Week 12-15 but not earlier.

### Scaffolding Logic

**Builds on:** All prior Movements contribute to M4. M1 generated corpus. M2 organized and classified it. M3 consolidated and connected it. M4 publishes from it. Without accumulated material (M1-M3), students would have nothing to select, reflect on, or publish.

**Prepares for:** M4 is terminal in this course but preparatory for future writing. Transfer Proposal explicitly stages application beyond the course. Reflective Cover Letter teaches argument-from-evidence skills useful in professional contexts (performance reviews, fellowship applications, job portfolios). Portfolio assembly teaches curation skills transferable to professional documentation.

**Constraint Sequencing Principle**: M4 is when *all* constraints arrive simultaneously—polish, coherence, citation correctness, presentation quality, time management (portfolio due Week 15). This convergence is deliberate: students need the experience of managing multiple competing demands with deadline pressure. But they also have tools/systems developed across M1-M3 to handle this complexity.

## Pedagogical Approach

### Activity Design Rationale

**Portfolio Selection as Compositional Act**: Selection *is* writing, not just bureaucracy. By asking students to choose 4-6 fragments from 30-42 options, M4 teaches that *what you include/exclude shapes meaning*. This is curatorial thinking—relevant beyond school writing (exhibition design, documentation strategy, content management).

**Pedagogical foundation**: Shipka's "Statement of Goals and Choices" (SOGC) methodology. Shipka argues that explaining *why* you made specific choices demonstrates understanding of composing as decision-making process. M4's selection process + Reflective Cover Letter operationalizes this: students don't just select pieces, they explain *why* these pieces and *how* they fit together.

**Documented Inquiry**: This assignment replaces traditional "research paper" but foregrounds process over conclusion. Traditional research papers imply knowledge-as-product: you research, discover answer, present findings. Documented Inquiry treats inquiry itself as valuable: posing genuine questions, following them through sources, refining understanding without requiring tidy conclusions.

**Pedagogical foundation**: Salvatori's [[@salvatori1996conve]] "difficulty paper" methodology and Bernstein's embrace of the "difficult poem." Both argue that wrestling with complexity is the work, not arriving at clarity. Documented Inquiry teaches students to value the inquiry process, making intellectual labor visible.

**Process Archaeology**: This assignment treats students' own work as *data*—analyzable evidence of patterns, development, growth. It's research methodology applied to self-study: identify corpus (your work), develop questions (what patterns exist?), analyze evidence (dev logs, version history), make claims (supported by examples).

**Pedagogical foundation**: Reflective practice (Schön), metacognition research (Taczak & Robertson), and self-assessment pedagogy (Andrade & Valtcheva). Process Archaeology is structured self-assessment: not "did I learn?" but "what evidence shows patterns in my learning?"

**Transfer Proposal**: Most composition courses end with vague gestures toward transfer ("you can use these skills elsewhere"). M4's Transfer Proposal forces specificity: identify actual future context, specify constraints it involves, design appropriate constraint sequence. This concrete application increases transfer likelihood.

**Pedagogical foundation**: Transfer research distinguishes "far transfer" (to very different context) from "near transfer" (to similar context). M4 asks for *specific* transfer, not abstract ("I can write better" → "In Biology 101, I'll capture lab observations on index cards during experiments, then draft reports from accumulated notes, following constraint sequence of: accuracy first, then organization, then prose polish").

### Time Allocation Logic

**R-heavy pattern** (M4): Revision work dominates because polish requires sustained attention. Research on revision (Sommers, Perl [[@perl1979compp]]) shows that substantive revision—the kind that improves writing quality—requires time: reading work with fresh eyes, identifying weak spots, testing alternatives, getting feedback, implementing changes. M4's R-heavy weeks provide that time.

**Why minimal W blocks?** Most writing in M4 is *revision of existing material* rather than generation of new material. Process Archaeology and Transfer Proposal are new compositions, but together they're <2500 words—manageable within a few W blocks. The bulk of M4 work is bringing 4-6 selected fragments to publication quality, which is R work.

**Presentations as culmination**: Week 14's presentations serve multiple functions: (1) public sharing normalizes writing as communicative act, (2) hearing peers' inquiries creates intellectual community, (3) oral presentation teaches adaptation across modes, (4) deadline pressure (must have work ready by Week 14) motivates completion. Presentations are formative for portfolio (get feedback before final submission) and summative for semester (closure ritual).

### Differentiation Strategies

**For students struggling with selection**:
- Provide decision matrices (rate fragments on multiple criteria, select highest scorers)
- Conference individually to discuss which pieces best represent their inquiry
- Allow "trial portfolios"—assemble different versions, compare, choose

**For students who resist reflective writing**:
- Frame reflection as *evidence-based analysis*, not feelings journaling
- Provide concrete prompts: "Compare dev log entry from Week 2 to Week 11. What changed?"
- Model analytical reflection vs. vague reflection (good: "I wrote most effectively on Tuesdays after reading"; bad: "I learned a lot")

**For students anxious about presentations**:
- Emphasize informal format (conversation, not performance)
- Provide structure (8-10 minutes, three components)
- Allow notes/slides (not memorized speech)
- Frame as practice for professional contexts (conference presentations, job talks)

## Assignment Design

### Documented Inquiry

**Why this assignment specifically?**

Documented Inquiry replaces traditional research paper while preserving valuable elements (source engagement, sustained thinking, polished prose) and removing problematic elements (fake thesis-defense structure, pretense of objectivity, arrival-at-answer as goal).

The assignment values *thinking in public*—showing how you work through complexity using sources—over *presenting conclusions*. This better reflects how knowledge actually works in most fields: inquiry is ongoing, questions lead to more questions, understanding is provisional.

**Connection to course innovations**: Documented Inquiry embodies the course's "writing as process" commitment. Traditional research papers hide the process (only show final product). Documented Inquiry *is* the process made visible: you pose question, follow it through sources, trace development of thinking.

### Process Archaeology + Transfer Proposal

**Why these assignments specifically?**

These paired assignments operationalize the course's dual commitment to **metacognition** (Process Archaeology) and **transfer** (Transfer Proposal). Together they ask: what patterns characterized your work in *this* context, and how would you adapt them for *new* contexts?

Process Archaeology provides the data (evidence of what you did). Transfer Proposal provides the application (what principles generalize). This pairing teaches that transfer requires *analysis* (understanding what you did and why) before *application* (using it elsewhere).

**Connection to course innovations**: Both assignments treat constraint sequencing as course's central transferable principle. Process Archaeology asks students to identify *what* constraint sequences they experienced and *how* they responded. Transfer Proposal asks students to design *new* constraint sequences for *future* contexts. This makes abstract principle (constraint sequencing) concrete and actionable.

### Prompt Design

**Documented Inquiry constraints**:

| Constraint | Pedagogical Purpose |
|------------|-------------------|
| "Pose genuine question" | Requires real inquiry, not fake question with known answer |
| "Engage multiple sources" | Demonstrates source synthesis, not just citation |
| "Show development of thinking" | Makes process visible; values intellectual labor |
| "Conclude with further questions" | Normalizes inquiry-as-ongoing, not knowledge-as-fixed |

**Process Archaeology constraints**:

| Constraint | Pedagogical Purpose |
|------------|-------------------|
| "Analyze your dev logs, system maps, version histories" | Requires evidence-based reflection, not vague impressions |
| "Identify patterns" | Teaches pattern recognition as analytical skill |
| "Compare early and late work" | Makes growth visible through contrast |
| "Make claims supported by evidence" | Applies academic argumentation to self-study |

**Transfer Proposal constraints**:

| Constraint | Pedagogical Purpose |
|------------|-------------------|
| "Describe specific future project" | Forces concrete application, not abstract transfer |
| "Specify constraints" | Requires understanding constraints as variables |
| "Sequence when constraints arrive" | Applies course's central principle |
| "Justify the timing" | Shows understanding of *why* sequence matters |

### Anticipated Student Interpretations

**Possible misreading (Documented Inquiry)**: "I need to answer my question definitively."  
**Mitigation**: Emphasize that refining the question or identifying further questions *is* a valid conclusion. Model examples where inquiry leads to complexity rather than resolution.

**Possible misreading (Process Archaeology)**: "This is just a reflection on what I learned."  
**Mitigation**: Distinguish *analysis* (evidence-based examination of patterns) from *reflection* (impressionistic account of feelings). Require specific examples and data from documentation.

**Possible misreading (Transfer Proposal)**: "I should list all the skills I learned."  
**Mitigation**: Focus on *constraint sequencing* as transferable principle, not skills inventory. One well-developed transfer example is better than vague list of everything.

## Assessment Philosophy

### Portfolio Grading as Holistic Argument

M4 portfolio grading differs from M1-M3 grading. Earlier milestones were graded on *completion* and *engagement* (did you do the work? did you try?). Final portfolio is graded on *quality*, *coherence*, and *evidence of learning*.

**Holistic scoring considers**:
- Selection judgment (do chosen pieces represent strong inquiry?)
- Revision quality (is polished work substantially improved?)
- Process documentation (is labor visible and analyzable?)
- Coherence (do pieces fit together to tell a story?)
- Metacognitive insight (does reflection demonstrate understanding?)
- Transfer articulation (are principles concretely applied?)

**Weight of components** (within 450-point portfolio):

| Component | Points | Justification |
|-----------|--------|---------------|
| Documented Inquiry (polished) | 100 | Major piece demonstrating source work and sustained thinking |
| Process Archaeology | 75 | Evidence of metacognitive analysis |
| 4-6 polished fragments | 150 | Quality of revision and selection judgment |
| Transfer Proposal | 50 | Transfer articulation and constraint sequencing understanding |
| Reflective Cover Letter | 50 | Argument for learning, synthesis of portfolio |
| Process Evidence (dev logs, etc.) | 25 | Completeness and usefulness of documentation |

### Why Portfolio-Delayed Grading Works

Students submitted Literacy Narrative (M1), Spec Doc + Constraint Audit (M2), and BEAM Portfolio (M3) for milestone grades during semester. These grades provided formative feedback but were *not* final judgments. Portfolio allows revision of *any* work, meaning early grades don't lock students into low trajectories.

**Pedagogical advantage**: Students learn from early feedback without penalty. If Literacy Narrative received 40/50 in Week 3, revision for portfolio can demonstrate growth. Portfolio becomes argument for learning trajectory, not snapshot of single moment.

**Assessment equity**: Portfolio-delayed grading reduces impact of early struggles. Students who start slow but develop over time can demonstrate that development. Students who master material quickly can show sustained quality. Both trajectories are valued.

## Evidence & Iteration

### Evidence to Collect

- [ ] Final fragment count per student (target: 36-52)
- [ ] Portfolio completion rate (how many students submit complete portfolios?)
- [ ] Revision quality (compare milestone versions to portfolio versions of same work)
- [ ] Process Archaeology depth (how many students provide evidence-based analysis vs. vague reflection?)
- [ ] Transfer specificity (how many students provide concrete application vs. abstract statements?)
- [ ] Presentation participation and quality
- [ ] Student self-reported transfer (follow-up survey: did principles apply in other courses?)

### Revision Notes

**From prior iterations** (if applicable):
- Students sometimes struggle with "genuine question" for Documented Inquiry—may need more scaffolding on distinguishing genuine vs. fake inquiry questions.
- Process Archaeology sometimes devolves into chronology ("first I did X, then I did Y") rather than analysis. Need stronger models of analytical vs. narrative reflection.
- Transfer Proposal sometimes remains abstract despite prompts for specificity. Consider requiring students to bring examples from target context (syllabi, assignment sheets) to ground their proposals.

**For future iterations**:
- Experiment with mid-portfolio check-in (Week 13)—students submit draft Table of Contents and get feedback on selection/organization before final assembly.
- Consider peer portfolio review (students examine each other's draft portfolios and offer feedback on coherence/completeness).
- Develop stronger rubric for distinguishing levels of revision (surface vs. structural vs. conceptual).

## Culmination, Not Conclusion

### M4 as Semester Synthesis

Movement 4 isn't just "the end" but *culmination*—a bringing-together of threads developed across M1-M3. The six-moves vocabulary is now complete (Capture→Classify→Route→Distill→Connect→Publish). The constraint sequencing principle, introduced incrementally, is now explicit enough for students to design their own sequences. The corpus, accumulated fragment by fragment, is now large enough to curate from.

M4 demonstrates that the course's innovations aren't add-ons but *necessary structure* for this pedagogy:
- Without accumulation (M1), nothing to select from
- Without classification (M2), can't find related pieces
- Without consolidation (M3), corpus remains undifferentiated
- Without publication (M4), labor remains private

**The course is a system**, and M4 is the output phase that validates the input, processing, and storage phases that preceded it.

### Beyond the Course

Portfolio completion isn't course completion—it's *readiness for transfer*. Students leave with:
- Demonstrated ability to work at scale (corpus management)
- Organizational systems applicable to future contexts
- Metacognitive awareness of their own processes
- Vocabulary for naming writing operations
- Understanding of constraints as strategic variables

These outcomes are *transferable* because they're *principled*. Students don't just know "how to write a research paper" (context-specific skill) but understand "how constraints shape what's writable" (generalizable principle).

**The measure of M4's success**: not what students produce for the portfolio, but what they can produce *beyond* it.
