# Index Cards: Your Analog Thinking Tool

> [!info] Tech Stack Guide
> **Component**: Overview
> **Track**: Content (what students encounter)
> **Related**: [[tech-stack-rationale-reasons-v101|Why Index Cards?]]
> **When Used**: Week 2 (T1 block), used throughout semester

## Why Index Cards?

Index cards are your **first capture system**—the place where ideas land before they become fragments. They're:

- **Cheap** (~$3-5 for a pack of 100)
- **Fast** (no booting up, no login)
- **Tactile** (you can sort, shuffle, spread out on a table)
- **Forgiving** (bad idea? Toss it. No delete key guilt.)

You'll use them alongside digital tools, not instead of them. Cards are for **thinking**; Word documents are for **storing**.

---

## Card Anatomy

Each card has two sides with different jobs.

### Front: Capture

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Date: 2026-02-03                        │
│ Source: Salvatori, "Difficulty"         │
│                                         │
│ "Reading is an act of resistance"       │
│ - Texts don't give up meaning easily    │
│ - Good reading requires wrestling       │
│                                         │
│ Tags: M2 / !                            │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**What goes on front:**
- **Date**: When you wrote the card
- **Source**: Where the idea came from (reading, class, your brain)
- **Core idea**: The claim, quote, or observation (brief!)
- **Tags**: Movement (M1-M4) + Status symbol (see below)

**Keep it short**: One idea per card. If you have two ideas, use two cards.

---

### Back: Processing

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                         │
│ CONNECTIONS:                            │
│ - Relates to Bartholomae's "inventing   │
│   the university" idea                  │
│ - My literacy narrative about learning  │
│   to read Shakespeare                   │
│                                         │
│ QUESTIONS:                              │
│ - What makes a text "difficult"?        │
│ - Is difficulty always productive?      │
│                                         │
│ NEXT STEPS:                             │
│ - Expand into fragment comparing        │
│   Salvatori & Bartholomae               │
│                                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**What goes on back:**
- **Connections**: How this links to other ideas, readings, or your own work
- **Questions**: What you're still wondering
- **Next steps**: What you might do with this (turn into fragment, investigate further, etc.)

**When to fill in the back**: At the end of each week when you process your cards.

---

## Tagging System

### Movement Tags

Use the Movement you're currently in:
- **M1** = Weeks 1-3 (Surfacing)
- **M2** = Weeks 4-7 (Naming)
- **M3** = Weeks 8-11 (Operating at Scale)
- **M4** = Weeks 12-15 (Synthesis)

### Status Symbols

These show what you plan to do with the card:

- **?** = Question/uncertainty (need to investigate)
- **!** = Important/exciting (want to develop further)
- **↑** = Ready to transfer to digital
- **✓** = Already transferred (card can be archived)

**Example tag line**: `M2 / !` = "This is from Movement 2, and I'm excited about it"

---

## Organization Options

You'll experiment with different ways to organize your cards. Here are three common methods:

### By Movement (Recommended Start)

Four piles: M1, M2, M3, M4

**Pros**: Mirrors your folder structure, easy to see progression

**Cons**: Doesn't show thematic connections across Movements

---

### By Topic

Piles by theme: "difficulty," "literacy," "authority," "genre," etc.

**Pros**: See how one topic develops across the semester

**Cons**: Topics emerge slowly; hard to use early in semester

---

### By Status

Four piles: ? (questions), ! (develop), ↑ (transfer), ✓ (done)

**Pros**: Always know what needs attention

**Cons**: Doesn't preserve chronology or themes

---

**Your choice**: Start with Movement-based. Switch to topic-based or status-based if it serves you better. You can also use **multiple sorting systems** at different times—cards are flexible.

---

## Weekly Rhythm

### During the Week: Capture

- Read for class? Write cards for interesting ideas.
- Freewriting in class? Write cards for claims you want to remember.
- Discussion sparks a thought? Card it.

**Goal**: 5-10 new cards per week (minimum)

**Where to keep them**: Small box, rubber band, zip pouch—something portable you can carry to class.

---

### End of Week: Process

Set aside 20-30 minutes to review your week's cards:

1. **Read front** of each card
2. **Fill in back** with connections, questions, next steps
3. **Update status symbols** if needed
4. **Sort cards** into your chosen organization system
5. **Flag cards** to transfer to digital (↑ symbol)

**Dev log entry**: Write about what patterns you notice, what surprised you, what you want to explore.

---

## Transferring to Digital

Not every card becomes a Word document. Transfer cards when:
- You want to develop the idea beyond a note (turn it into a 150-400 word fragment)
- You need to cite it formally (requires Zotero)
- You want to submit it for feedback (Eli Review)

### How to Transfer

1. Open a new Word doc in OneDrive
2. Name it using the convention: `YYYY-MM-DD-topic-slug-draft.docx`
3. Expand the card's idea into a full fragment
4. Mark the card with ✓ (transferred)
5. Keep the card—don't throw it away

**Week 8**: You'll have a formal session called "What You're Automating" where you transfer your card organization system to digital folders.

---

## Index Cards vs. Digital

| Index Cards | Word Documents |
|-------------|----------------|
| Fast capture | Developed thought |
| Physical sorting | Digital search |
| One idea per card | Extended argument |
| Visible at a glance | Requires scrolling |
| Tactile thinking | Text-based thinking |

You need both. Cards help you think; documents help you store.

---

## Tips for Success

### Capturing

- Write cards **while reading**, not after (you'll forget)
- One idea per card (resist the urge to cram)
- Front side only at first—back comes later
- Include source even if it seems obvious
- Date everything

### Processing

- Block time at week's end (Friday afternoon?)
- Spread cards on a table to see patterns
- Don't overthink connections—first instinct is fine
- Update status symbols based on what you actually want to do

### Organizing

- Try different systems until one feels right
- It's okay to re-sort frequently
- Keep a "dead cards" pile for ideas that didn't develop
- Don't let "perfect organization" block you from writing

---

## Common Questions

### "Do I have to use index cards?"

Yes, at least through Week 8. After that, you can switch to digital-only if cards aren't working for you. But most students find they keep using cards even after the digital transfer because they serve different cognitive functions.

### "What size cards should I buy?"

3×5 inches is standard. 4×6 if you like more room. Lined or unlined—your preference.

### "Can I use a different color for each Movement?"

Yes! Color-coding is a great organizational strategy.

### "What if I lose a card?"

That's the risk of physical media. Keep them together (box, pouch, rubber band). Don't carry your whole collection everywhere—just the current week's cards.

### "What if I write a card and later realize it's wrong or bad?"

That's fine. Mark it with an X or put it in a "dead cards" pile. The card was useful for thinking even if the idea didn't work out.

---

## What Success Looks Like

By Week 8, you should have:
- 30-50 cards accumulated
- A functional organization system
- Clear status symbols on most cards
- Backs filled in with connections and questions
- 10-15 cards transferred to digital fragments

By Week 12, you should:
- Still be writing cards for new readings
- Have a "dead cards" pile of ideas that didn't develop
- Be able to find a card within 1-2 minutes
- Understand which ideas work better as cards vs. digital

---

## Troubleshooting

### "I have too many cards and can't keep them organized"

Use rubber bands or binder clips to create sub-stacks. Keep only current week's cards loose.

### "I'm not sure what to write on the back"

Start with just one section: Connections OR Questions OR Next Steps. The back develops over time.

### "I wrote a card but can't read my own handwriting"

Illegible cards are useless. Slow down. If handwriting is genuinely hard for you, talk to your instructor about alternatives.

### "My cards don't seem connected to anything"

That's normal early in the semester. Connections emerge as your corpus grows. Keep capturing; patterns will appear.
