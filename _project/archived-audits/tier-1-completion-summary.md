# Tier 1 Correction Completion Summary

**Date:** 2026-02-12
**Tier:** 1 (Critical Cross-Movement Errors)
**Files Corrected:** 6 (3 content + 3 reasons pairs)
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

---

## Files Corrected

### 1. Bernstein "Blood on the Cutting Room Floor"  
**Correction:** Week 6 Movement 2 → Week 13 Movement 4

**Content file changes:**
- sync-group: movement2-readings → movement4-readings  
- Context: Completely reframed from M2 peer review/source work → M4 portfolio curation/Process Archaeology
- Guiding questions: Rewritten to focus on portfolio curation decisions, permission flags, cutting room floor as evidence
- Related Notes: Updated movement context + added explicit assignment connection to Process Archaeology

**Reasons file changes:**
- sync-group: movement2-readings → movement4-readings
- Why Week placement: Complete pedagogical reframe from revision cycles → portfolio curation
- How Students Engage: Rewritten for W13 context (portfolio assembly, not peer review)
- Connection to Activities: Updated from Eli Review → Process Archaeology/permission flags
- Ongoing Application: Revised to focus on final portfolio work
- Related Notes: Updated movement + assignment connections

---

### 2. Kirschenbaum "Prepare for the Textpocalypse"
**Correction:** Week 4 Movement 2 → Week 1 Movement 1

**Content file changes:**
- sync-group: movement2-readings → movement1-readings
- depends-on: Removed Ong dependency (they're independent)
- Context: Major reframe from "organizing accumulated fragments" → "orientation to writing-as-technology foundation"  
- Guiding questions: Completely rewritten for prospective orientation (what system WILL you build?) vs retrospective problem-solving (how do I fix this mess?)
- Related Notes: Removed Ong as foundational reading, updated movement context

**Reasons file changes:**
- sync-group: movement2-readings → movement1-readings
- depends-on: Removed Ong dependency
- Why Week placement: **MAJOR REWRITE** - completely new pedagogical justification for W1 orientation vs W4 problem-solving
  - Old: Students have accumulated writing, experience file management problems
  - New: Proactive design orientation, students make conscious tool choices from start
- Theoretical Grounding: Updated to reflect W1 foundational role  
- How Students Engage: Rewritten for prospective framing (what should I design?) vs retrospective (how do I fix it?)
- Connection to Activities: Updated from folder setup/Zotero → orientation/preview
- Ongoing Application: Revised to show how W1 foundation supports later work
- Competing Values: Updated timing discussion for W1 placement
- Related Notes: Updated Ong relationship (extends, not depends on)

### 3. Bush "As We May Think"
**Correction:** Week 13 Movement 4 → Week 10 Movement 3

**Content file changes:**
- sync-group: movement4-readings → movement3-readings
- Context: Reframed from final portfolio → BEAM Portfolio + **Difficulty Pair A completion marker added**
- Description: Updated to note pairing with Star, completion of Difficulty Pair A from Salvatori (W3)
- Guiding questions: **COMPLETELY REWRITTEN** to integrate Star and Salvatori explicitly:
  - Q1: Bush + Star connection (infrastructure forces linearity)
  - Q2: Bush + Salvatori connection (personal knowledge systems + difficulty revealing processes)
  - Q3: Bush + Star connection (trails depend on infrastructure)
- Related Notes: **Major expansion** - added Difficulty Pair A documentation (partner: Star, beginning: Salvatori), updated movement context, added BEAM Portfolio assignment connection

**Reasons file changes:**
- sync-group: movement4-readings → movement3-readings
- Why This Reading: **MAJOR ADDITION** - added full Difficulty Pair A explanation and thematic connection
- Why Week placement: Complete rewrite from portfolio assembly (W13) → BEAM Portfolio work (W10) + pairing with Star justification
- How Students Engage: Rewritten questions to show explicit Bush+Star+Salvatori connections
- Connection to Activities: Updated from final portfolio → BEAM Portfolio Framing
- Ongoing Application: Revised to show W10 reading supports later M4 work
- Competing Values: Updated timing discussion for W10 placement  
- Evidence to Collect: Rewritten for BEAM Portfolio context + Difficulty Pair connections
- Revision Notes: Updated for W10 timing + Star pairing
- Related Notes: **Major expansion** - added Difficulty Pair A partners (Star, Salvatori), updated assignment to BEAM Portfolio, updated movement context

## Pedagogical Reframing Summary

### Bernstein (W6→W13)
**Old purpose:** Validate revision labor during M2 source integration work  
**New purpose:** Frame portfolio curation as meaning-making during M4 synthesis
**Key shift:** "Cutting room floor" from discarded sources → discarded fragments/drafts
**Assignment:** From implied Constraint Audit → explicit Process Archaeology

### Kirschenbaum (W4→W1)  
**Old purpose:** Solve file management problems students are experiencing
**New purpose:** Establish foundational frame for conscious tool selection
**Key shift:** Retrospective problem-solving → proactive design orientation
**Constraint sequencing:** From experience-then-understand → understand-then-build
**Most extensive rewrite** - entire pedagogical logic inverted

### Bush (W13→W10)
**Old purpose:** Historical perspective on portfolio assembly challenges
**New purpose:** Historical grounding for BEAM Portfolio + Difficulty Pair A completion
**Key shift:** Associative/linear tension in final portfolio → trails/infrastructure in research documentation
**Major addition:** Difficulty Pair A theme integration with explicit Star + Salvatori connections

## Verification Checklist

- [x] All 6 files (3 content + 3 reasons) have correct week numbers
- [x] All 6 files have correct movement contexts
- [x] sync-group fields updated in frontmatter (6/6 files)
- [x] Pedagogical context reframed appropriately for new timing
- [x] Guiding questions rewritten where necessary (Kirschenbaum, Bush completely; Bernstein partially)
- [x] Assignment connections added/updated (Bernstein → Process Archaeology, Bush → BEAM Portfolio)
- [x] Related Notes updated (movement contexts, assignment links)
- [x] Dependency removed (Kirschenbaum no longer depends on Ong)
- [x] Difficulty Pair A markers added to Bush (partner: Star, beginning: Salvatori)

## Cross-References to Verify Next

These files may reference the corrected readings and need checking:

### Bernstein references to check:
- Process Archaeology assignment file (should reference Bernstein W13)
- Movement 4 overview/index (should list Bernstein)
- Movement 2 overview (should NOT list Bernstein)

### Kirschenbaum references to check:
- Week 1 overview/schedule (should list Kirschenbaum)
- Week 4 overview/schedule (should NOT list Kirschenbaum)
- Movement 1 overview (should list Kirschenbaum)
- Movement 2 overview (should NOT list Kirschenbaum)
- Ong reasons file (might reference Kirschenbaum dependency - should be independent)

### Bush references to check:
- Star reasons file (should note Bush pairing for Difficulty Pair A)
- Salvatori reasons file (should note Bush as Difficulty Pair A completion)
- BEAM Portfolio assignment (should reference Bush W10)
- Week 10 overview/schedule (should list Bush + Star together)
- Week 13 overview/schedule (should NOT list Bush)
- Movement 3 overview (should list Bush)
- Movement 4 overview (should NOT list Bush)

## Next Steps

1. ✅ **Tier 1 complete** - All critical cross-movement errors corrected with full pedagogical reframing
2. ⏭️ **Update verification matrix** - Mark Bernstein, Kirschenbaum, Bush as corrected
3. ⏭️ **Tier 2 Q&A** - Review high-priority difficulty pair + tech documentation files (4 files):
   - Salvatori (W2→W3) - Difficulty Pair A beginning
   - Star (W11→W10) - Difficulty Pair A completion with Bush
   - Alexander (W6→W7) - Difficulty Pair B completion  
   - README (W4-5→W2) - Tech documentation timing
4. ⏭️ **Check cascade effects** after Tier 2

*Completed: 2026-02-12*
*Time invested: ~45 minutes for pedagogical reframing*
*Most complex rewrite: Kirschenbaum (W4→W1) required complete pedagogical inversion*
