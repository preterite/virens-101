## Verification Matrix ✅ COMPLETE

**CRITICAL FINDING: 12 of 15 files (80%) have incorrect week assignments**

| Reading File | Week in File | Should Be | Offset | Assignment Refs | Difficulty Pair | Status |

**Legend:**
- ✅ = Correct week assignment
- ⚠️ = Wrong week, needs correction
- 🚨 = MAJOR misalignment (crosses movement boundaries)
- Offset = (file week) - (correct week); negative = file shows earlier week

**Progress:** 15 of 15 files checked (100%)

---

## Known Discrepancies ✅ CATALOGUED

### Movement Boundary Violations (3 files)

**1. Bernstein "Blood on the Cutting Room Floor" 🚨 CRITICAL**
- **Says:** Week 6 (Movement 2: Naming, constraint work)
- **Should be:** Week 13 (Movement 4: Synthesis, permission flags)
- **Offset:** -7 weeks (shows 7 weeks too early)
- **Impact:** Entire revision pedagogy sequence disrupted
  - Currently: "Revision as meaning-making" during M2 source integration
  - Should be: "Revision as permission flags" during M4 portfolio assembly
- **Cascading effects:**
  - File discusses "cutting room floor" = discarded material
  - M2 context: cutting sources during BEAM work
  - M4 context: cutting drafts during Process Archaeology
  - Pedagogical logic completely different depending on placement

**2. Kirschenbaum "Prepare for the Textpocalypse"**
- **Says:** Week 4 (Movement 2: Naming begins)
- **Should be:** Week 1 (Movement 1: Surfacing, orientation)
- **Offset:** -3 weeks
- **Impact:** Foundation reading appears too late
  - Should establish "writing as technology" frame in orientation week
  - Currently appears after tech setup complete (Week 2)
  - Students experience tech before having conceptual frame for it

**3. Bush "As We May Think"**
- **Says:** Week 13 (Movement 4: Synthesis)
- **Should be:** Week 10 (Movement 3: Scale, with Star)
- **Offset:** +3 weeks
- **Impact:** Difficulty Pair A completion marker wrong
  - Bush pairs with Star (both W10) for invisible infrastructure theme
  - File places Bush in M4, disrupting pair pedagogy
  - Students get historical context after portfolio work begins, not during

### Difficulty Pair Documentation Errors (4 files)

**Pair A: Making Invisible Processes/Systems Visible**
- **Salvatori** (says W2, should be W3): Pair beginning marker off by 1 week
- **Star** (says W11, should be W10): Pair return marker off by 1 week
- **Bush** (says W13, should be W10): Pair return marker off by 3 weeks (see above)
- **Impact:** Students don't see echoing structure (W3→W10) clearly

**Pair B: Form, Fit, and Systems**  
- **Meadows** (says W5, correct): ✅ Pair beginning marker accurate
- **Alexander** (says W6, should be W7): Pair completion marker off by 1 week
- **Impact:** Students experience Alexander before Constraint Audit due (W7), reducing pedagogical reinforcement

### Within-Movement Misalignments (5 files)

**Movement 1 (Surfacing) — 1 file:**
- **README examples** (says W4-5, should be W2): Tech documentation arrives after tech setup week

**Movement 2 (Naming) — 2 files:**
- **Downs** (says W3, should be W4): SEAR framework before Literacy Narrative due
- **Library/Jackson** (says W8/W7, should be W6): BEAM readings displaced into M3

**Movement 3 (Scale) — 2 files:**
- **Brooks** (says W9, should be W8): Complexity reading during conference week instead of before
- **Ribes** (says W10, should be W11): Maintenance labor reading before BEAM Portfolio due

### Correction Priority Tiers

**TIER 1 — CRITICAL (3 files):**
1. Bernstein (W6→W13): 7-week cross-movement error, disrupts revision pedagogy
2. Kirschenbaum (W4→W1): Orientation reading misplaced, affects foundational framing
3. Bush (W13→W10): 3-week error, breaks Difficulty Pair A structure

**TIER 2 — HIGH (4 files):**
4. Salvatori (W2→W3): Difficulty Pair A beginning marker
5. Star (W11→W10): Difficulty Pair A completion marker  
6. Alexander (W6→W7): Difficulty Pair B completion marker
7. README (W4-5→W2): Tech documentation timing

**TIER 3 — MEDIUM (5 files):**
8. Downs (W3→W4): Assignment support timing
9. Library (W8→W6): BEAM framework introduction
10. Jackson (W7→W6): Accumulation models
11. Brooks (W9→W8): Complexity vocabulary
12. Ribes (W10→W11): Maintenance timing

## Next Verification Steps

### Decision Point: Correction Strategy

**Two approaches:**

**A. Batch Scripted Correction:**
- Write bash/Python script to update all 12 files simultaneously
- Edit "Week X" strings in Context sections
- Advantages: Fast, consistent, auditable
- Risks: Might miss context-specific language adjustments needed

**B. Manual Tier-by-Tier Correction:**
- Fix Tier 1 (critical) first, verify effects
- Then Tier 2 (high priority), verify
- Then Tier 3 (medium priority), verify
- Advantages: Can adjust related language, catch cascade effects
- Disadvantages: Time-consuming, 12 files × manual edits

**Hybrid approach:**
- Script generates correction checklist with exact line locations
- Human reviews and approves each change
- Script applies approved changes in batch

### After Week Assignment Corrections

1. ✅ All 15 reading files checked for week assignments
2. ⏭️ **Extract assignment references** from all reading files (do they cite assignments correctly?)
3. ⏭️ **Check -reasons- files:** Do paired justification files need parallel week updates?
4. ⏭️ **Verify difficulty pair documentation** in both -course- and -reasons- files
5. ⏭️ **Compare against assignment files** for reciprocal references (Step 2B)
6. ⏭️ **Create comprehensive correction plan** with verification checkpoints
