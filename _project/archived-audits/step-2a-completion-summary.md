# Step 2A Completion Summary

**Date:** 2026-02-12
**Task:** Verify reading files align with consolidated semester schedule
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE — All 15 files checked

---

## Key Findings

### The Numbers
- **Total files checked:** 15 of 15 (100%)
- **Correct week assignments:** 3 files (20%)
- **Wrong week assignments:** 12 files (80%)
- **Cross-movement errors:** 3 files (major)
- **Difficulty pair errors:** 4 files (high priority)

### The Problem

80% of reading files have incorrect week assignments that don't match the consolidated semester schedule. These appear to be pre-consolidation assignments from earlier course development iterations.

---

## Severity Breakdown

### 🚨 TIER 1: Critical (3 files)

**Bernstein** — 7-week offset, crosses M2→M4
- Says Week 6 (Movement 2: Naming)
- Should be Week 13 (Movement 4: Synthesis)
- Impact: Entire revision pedagogy sequence wrong

**Kirschenbaum** — 3-week offset, foundation reading misplaced
- Says Week 4 (Movement 2: Naming)
- Should be Week 1 (Movement 1: Surfacing)
- Impact: Students get tech before conceptual frame

**Bush** — 3-week offset, breaks Difficulty Pair A
- Says Week 13 (Movement 4: Synthesis)
- Should be Week 10 (Movement 3: Scale)
- Impact: Historical context arrives too late, pair structure broken

---

### ⚠️ TIER 2: High Priority (4 files)

**Difficulty Pair Markers:**
- Salvatori: W2→W3 (Pair A beginning)
- Star: W11→W10 (Pair A completion with Bush)
- Alexander: W6→W7 (Pair B completion with Meadows)

**Tech Documentation:**
- README: W4-5→W2 (needed during tech setup, not after)

---

### 📝 TIER 3: Medium Priority (5 files)

Within-movement timing adjustments:
- Downs: W3→W4
- Library: W8→W6
- Jackson: W7→W6
- Brooks: W9→W8
- Ribes: W10→W11

---

## Correct Files (Keep As-Is)

✅ **Ong** (Week 2) — Tech setup reading
✅ **Meadows** (Week 5) — Difficulty Pair B beginning
✅ **Norman** (Week 12) — Process Archaeology support

---

## What This Means

### Pedagogical Impact

**Difficulty Pairs disrupted:**
- Pair A (invisible processes/systems) has wrong timing markers
- Students won't see W3→W10 echo structure clearly
- Bush separated from Star (should both be W10)

**Movement boundaries crossed:**
- Orientation reading (Kirschenbaum) appears 3 weeks late
- Revision concepts (Bernstein) in wrong movement entirely
- Historical context (Bush) after it's pedagogically useful

**Assignment support timing off:**
- SEAR framework (Downs) before Literacy Narrative due
- README models after tech setup already complete
- Maintenance concepts (Ribes) before portfolio complete

### What Needs To Happen

1. **Immediate:** Decide correction strategy
   - Scripted batch correction
   - Manual tier-by-tier
   - Hybrid approach (recommended)

2. **After corrections:** Check cascade effects
   - Do -reasons- files need parallel updates?
   - Are assignment references still accurate?
   - Is difficulty pair documentation consistent?

3. **Step 2B preparation:** Assignment file verification
   - Do assignment files reference readings correctly?
   - Are reciprocal links accurate?

## Documents Updated

**Created:**
- `/y_meta/reading-week-correction-plan.md` — Detailed correction strategy

**Updated:**
- `/y_meta/schedule-alignment-audit.md` — Step 2A marked complete
- `/y_meta/reading-assignment-alignment-map.md` — Full verification matrix

---

## Decision Point

**You need to choose:**

1. **Correction approach** — Script, manual, or hybrid?
2. **Scope** — Fix all 12 now, or Tier 1 first?
3. **Cascade handling** — Check -reasons- files simultaneously?

**My recommendation:**
- Use hybrid approach (script with manual review)
- Fix Tier 1 first (3 critical files)
- Verify effects before proceeding to Tier 2-3
- Check -reasons- files after -course- files verified
