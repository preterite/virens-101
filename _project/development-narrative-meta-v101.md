## Overview: From Theory to Implementation

This document narrates the development of VIRENS 101, an innovative first-year composition course integrating composition pedagogy with systems thinking. The course emerged through a systematic generative process: approximately 150 files created across four intensive days, moving from theoretical foundations through structural architecture to complete implementation materials.

The development followed an explicit methodology: "YOLO up, constrain down"—generate possibilities expansively before applying evaluative constraints. Each phase built on the previous, with earlier decisions creating the architecture within which later materials fit.

---

## Stage 1: Foundational Theory (January 21, 2026)

### Batch 1A: Core Theoretical Frameworks (7 files)

The course design began with theoretical architecture rather than assignments or schedules. Three foundational frameworks were documented as paired content/justification notes:

**Six-Move Vocabulary Framework**
- Capture → Classify → Route → Distill → Connect → Publish
- Provides shared terminology across semester
- Grounds writing as material practice with nameable operations

**W/P/R Rhythm Structure**
- Writing (W), Peer Review (P), Revision (R) modes
- Block-by-block specification of activity types
- Creates predictable patterns students can internalize

**Textual Accumulation Model**
- 40-50 fragments (150-400 words each) replace discrete assignments
- Writing produces intellectual capital, not just course compliance
- Fragment quotas operationalize accumulation principle

*Rationale*: Beginning with theory rather than practice ensured subsequent decisions were grounded in explicit principles rather than implicit assumptions.

### Batch 1B: Course Architecture (7 files)

With core concepts established, the design moved to structural architecture:

**Time Structure Documentation**
- 15 weeks, 6 blocks per week (25 minutes each)
- 90 total blocks, 62 available for instruction
- Configurable as 1×150, 2×75, or 3×50 meeting patterns

**Assessment Overview**
- 50/50 portfolio/formative split
- Portfolio as accumulated capital demonstration
- Formative work as ongoing labor recognition

*Rationale*: Architecture before content ensured all subsequent materials would fit within established constraints rather than requiring retrofitting.

---

## Stage 2: Movement Structure (January 21, 2026)

### Batch 1C: Movement Overviews (8 files, 4 pairs)

The four-movement structure emerged as the primary organizational framework:

| Movement | Weeks | Focus | Rationale |
|----------|-------|-------|-----------|
| M1: Surfacing | 1-3 | Expansion, capture, freewriting | Generate before judging |
| M2: Naming | 4-7 | Classification, source engagement | Organize accumulating material |
| M3: Operating at Scale | 8-11 | Corpus management, consolidation | Manage growing complexity |
| M4: Synthesis | 12-15 | Portfolio assembly, selection | Transform labor into capital |

Each movement received paired documentation: student-facing overview (what happens) and pedagogical justification (why it works).

**Key Design Decision**: Movement structure follows the "corpse to compost to garden" transformation—students accumulate seemingly dead fragments (corpse), learn to transform them through connection and revision (compost), and ultimately cultivate living portfolios (garden).

*Rationale*: Movement boundaries create psychological pacing that discrete week-by-week planning cannot achieve. Students understand their location in a semester-long arc.

---

## Stage 3: Technology and Assessment (January 21, 2026)

### Batch 1D: Tech Stack Documentation (8 files)

Technology decisions preceded assignment design to ensure all workflow specifications were possible within available tools:

**Path A: Eli-Centered Stack**
- Index cards (~$10-15): Analog capture/sorting
- OneDrive + Word (free): Digital storage/version control
- Zotero (free): Citation management
- Eli Review ($20): Structured peer feedback
- Canvas (free): Institutional integration

**Total student cost**: $30-35

**Tech Instruction Timing**
- T1-T2 (Week 2): Index cards, folder structure, Eli orientation
- T3-T4 (Week 5): Zotero library session
- T5 (Week 8): "What You're Automating" digital transfer
- T6 (Week 13): Optional advanced tools

*Rationale*: "Familiarize before stakes" principle—students encounter tools in low-pressure contexts before performance matters. Tech follows content: tools arrive when needed for real work, not before.

### Batch 1E: Assessment Documentation (14 files, 7 pairs)

Assessment structure operationalizes course values (what's evaluated = what matters):

**Grading Philosophy**
- 50% portfolio (accumulated capital)
- 50% formative (ongoing labor)
- B-range for complete + competent work

**Portfolio Requirements**
- Polished pieces (4-6 selected from corpus)
- Process evidence (drafts, peer feedback)
- Reflective cover letter (1,500-2,000 words)
- Curated presentation

**Formative Structure**
- Fragment accumulation: 15% (12% completion + 3% quality baseline)
- Revision & feedback: 20% (peer review + reflective one-pagers)
- Process documentation: 10% (dev logs + system maps)
- Participation: 5% (quizzes with 10 lowest dropped)

**Late Work Policy**
- Graduated penalties (20%/30%/50%) rather than zero tolerance
- Portfolio exempt from penalties
- Extension process for emergencies

*Rationale*: Labor-based principles adapted for traditional grading context. Completion-heavy formative assessment reduces anxiety while quality baseline prevents junk accumulation.

---

## Stage 4: Policies and Student Support (January 21-22, 2026)

### Batch 1F: Course Policies (18 files, 9 pairs across 3 passes)

**Pass 1: Core Academic Policies**
- AI/Academic Integrity (process documentation as authenticity check)
- Communication Expectations

**Pass 2: Attendance and Student Support**
- Attendance Policy (quizzes with forgiveness)
- Accommodations Policy (DRS coordination)
- Withdrawal Policy

**Pass 3: Classroom Environment**
- Classroom Conduct
- Technology Use
- Emergency Procedures

*Rationale*: Comprehensive policies reduce mid-semester improvisation and ensure equitable treatment. Three passes allowed for coherent grouping and cross-referencing.

---

## Stage 5: Outcomes and Requirements (January 22, 2026)

### Batch 1G: Outcomes Documentation

Seven course outcomes, each justified and aligned with institutional frameworks:

1. Composing Processes
2. Critical Thinking & Difficulty-as-Diagnostic
3. Rhetorical Awareness
4. Constraint Literacy
5. Textual Accumulation & Intellectual Capital
6. Workflow Technologies & Collaboration
7. Process Documentation & Metacognition

**Institutional Alignment**: WPA Outcomes Statement, NCTE Framework for Success, WSU UCORE requirements, WSU Writing Program goals.

*Rationale*: Outcomes documentation serves dual audiences—students (what they'll learn) and administrators (how course meets requirements). Complete alignment matrix demonstrates coverage.

### Batch 1H: Requirements Documentation (6 files, 3 pairs)

**Prerequisites & Preparation**
- Minimal barriers approach
- Transparent philosophy about varied preparation levels

**Technology Requirements & Access**
- Device requirements with alternatives
- Cost breakdown and assistance options

**Time Commitment & Labor Expectations**
- 4-6 hours/week out-of-class
- Honest workload communication
- Process documentation rationale

*Rationale*: Clear requirements set expectations before enrollment, reducing mid-semester surprises and supporting student planning.

---

## Stage 6: Reflection Scaffolding (January 22, 2026)

### Batch 1I: Reflection Pass 1 (4 files, 2 pairs)

**Portfolio Cover Letter Prompt**
- 1,500-2,000 words demonstrating all 7 outcomes
- Evidence-based (cite process documentation)
- Extensive scaffolding (most detailed prompt in course)

**Mid-Semester Reflection Checkpoint**
- Week 8-9, 500-750 words
- 3 growth patterns + 2 development areas
- Prepares for conference week

*Rationale*: Evidence-based reflection (not impressionistic "I learned a lot") requires process documentation to cite. Without dev logs, specific reflection is impossible.

### Course Description (a_description/, 4 files, 2 pairs)

**Catalog Description**: Conservative language for institutional context, maintaining legibility while signaling innovation through key term shifts ("processes," "awareness," "practices").

**Course Overview**: Fuller paragraph for syllabus integrating traditional language with VIRENS philosophy. Accessible to students without requiring composition theory background.

*Rationale*: Catalog audiences differ from syllabus audiences—descriptions matched to context.

### Batch 1J: Reflection Pass 2 (8 files, 4 pairs)

**Evidence-Based Reflection Guide**
- How to mine dev logs
- How to calculate statistics
- How to identify patterns

**Movement Transition Reflections**
- M1→M2 (Week 3)
- M2→M3 (Week 8)
- M3→M4 (Week 11-12)

*Rationale*: Complete reflection scaffolding from low-stakes transitions through high-stakes portfolio letter. Each stage builds skills for the next.

---

## Stage 7: Reading and Assignment Documentation (January 23, 2026)

### Student Readings (g_studentreadings/, 30 files, 15 pairs)

**Composition Theory Foundation**
- Ong [[@ong2012writi]]: Writing restructures consciousness
- Salvatori [[@salvatori1996conve]]: Difficulty as diagnostic
- Downs [[@downs2007teaci]]: Rhetoric as vocabulary

**Systems/Design Thinking**
- Meadows [[@meadows2008lever]]: Leverage points
- Alexander [[@alexander1964notet]]: Goodness of fit
- Star [[@star1999ethnp]]: Infrastructure invisibility
- Brooks [[@brooks1986silve]]: Essential vs. accidental complexity
- Norman [[@norman2013desig]]: Affordances

**Creative/Hybrid**
- Kirschenbaum: Textpocalypse
- Borges [[@borges1962labyr]] cluster: Library of Babel
- Jackson: My Body—A Wunderkammer
- Bernstein: Blood on the Cutting Room Floor

**Difficulty Pairs Established**
- Pair A: Salvatori (W3) ↔ Star (W10) — Visibility/Surfacing
- Pair B: Meadows (W5) ↔ Alexander (W7) — Intervention/Fit

*Rationale*: Readings balance composition pedagogy with systems thinking, providing dual vocabularies for understanding writing as both process and system.

### Assignment Documentation (f_assignments/, 38 files)

**Major Assignments** (9 pairs)
- Fragment Production
- Literacy Narrative
- Spec Document
- Constraint Audit
- Annotated Bibliography
- Documented Inquiry
- Process Archaeology
- System Map
- Transfer Proposal

**Supporting Materials**
- Instructor Prompt Framework + 11 prompts
- BEAM Framework
- Eli Review Guide
- 6 Peer Review Criteria files

*Rationale*: Complete assignment documentation enables other instructors to adopt course without extensive preparation.

---

## Stage 8: Weekly Index Generation (January 23-24, 2026)

### Generation Sequence

Weekly index notes required synthesis sections (~600-900 words) integrating readings, concepts, and course arc. Generation followed constraint density prioritization:

**Anchored Weeks First** (readings/assignments lock sequence)
- Week 1: Course entry, envelope exercise
- Week 3: Salvatori, difficulty-as-diagnostic (Pair A begins)
- Week 6: Classification, corpse→compost
- Week 8: Brooks, essential/accidental complexity

**Constraint-Dense Weeks Next**
- Week 10: Star + Bush [[@bush1945thinl]], 3 single-introduction concepts (Pair A completes)
- Week 7: Alexander, goodness of fit (Pair B completes)
- Week 5: Meadows, leverage points (Pair B begins)
- Week 12: Norman, affordances
- Week 11: Ribes [[@ribes2013datb]] & Jackson, maintenance labor
- Week 13: Bernstein, permission flags full treatment

**Flexible Weeks Last**
- Week 2: Ong, tech setup
- Week 4: SEAR introduction, M1→M2
- Week 9: Conference week
- Week 14: Presentations
- Week 15: Envelope return, portfolio

### Single-Introduction Concepts Tracking

Concepts with one introduction point, introduced explicitly per week:

| Week | Concept |
|------|---------|
| 2 | Graph thinking |
| 3 | Difficulty-as-diagnostic, metacognitive interruption |
| 5 | Leverage points, stocks/flows |
| 6 | Classification systems |
| 7 | Goodness of fit, misfits |
| 8 | Essential vs. accidental complexity, graceful degradation |
| 10 | Infrastructure invisibility, boundary objects, memex vision |
| 11 | Maintenance labor |
| 12 | Affordances |
| 13 | Revision as meaning-making |

*Rationale*: Systematic concept introduction prevents overwhelming students while ensuring coverage. Each concept named explicitly when introduced, then varied in subsequent deepening.

---

## Stage 9: Reading Finalization (January 24, 2026)

### Reading Rhythm Mapping

Readings assigned only to W (Writing) blocks—students encounter generative provocation before evaluative/revision work:

| Week | Pages | Pattern |
|------|-------|---------|
| W1 | 10 | Light (course entry) |
| W2 | 30-40 | Heavy (balanced by tech instruction) |
| W3 | 27 | Medium-heavy |
| W4 | 20-25 | Medium |
| W5 | 20 | Medium |
| W6 | 26-31 | Medium-heavy |
| W7 | 20-25 | Heavy (difficulty pair) |
| W8 | 15-20 | Medium |
| W9 | 0 | Conference week |
| W10 | 27 | Heavy (difficulty pair) |
| W11 | 20 | Medium |
| W12 | 35 | Heavy (practical) |
| W13 | 18 | Light (revision week) |
| W14 | 0 | Presentations |
| W15 | 4-5 | Light (portfolio) |

**Semester Total**: ~247-285 pages (within 250-300 target)

### "YOLO Up, Constrain Down" Principle

This phrase captures a recurring structural principle at multiple scales:

| Scale | Manifestation |
|-------|---------------|
| Semester | M1 expansion → M2-M4 increasing constraint |
| Weekly | W blocks precede R blocks |
| Week 1 | Kirschenbaum before syllabus |
| Assignments | Brainstorm → narrow |
| Envelope exercise | Capture raw hopes first; analyze 15 weeks later |
| Freewriting | Keep hand moving, judge later |

*Rationale*: Generate first, worry later. Natural rhythms make "worrying" into identifying which already-existing restrictions eliminate options—not doing fresh mental work, but recognizing what's already constrained.

---

## Design Principles Emergent from Process

### 1. Dual-Track Structure

Every course component exists in two registers:
- **Content track**: Student-facing, accessible, action-oriented
- **Justification track**: Scholarly, evidence-based, citation-ready

This serves dual audiences without compromise: students get what they need without theoretical overload; scholars and future instructors get grounded rationale.

### 2. Constraint Sequencing as Pedagogy

*When* constraints arrive matters as much as *what* they are. The development process modeled this: theory before structure, structure before content, content before schedule.

### 3. Process Documentation Philosophy

The course values process documentation because the development process was itself documented. Continuation context notes (15 total) tracked decisions, rationales, and alternatives considered—the same practice students learn through dev logs.

### 4. Systematic Vocabulary Introduction

Single-introduction concepts ensure manageable cognitive load while building shared terminology. Each concept introduced explicitly, then deepened through variation and application.

### 5. Difficulty Pairs as Thematic Architecture

Challenging readings paired across movements create coherence through productive contrast:
- Salvatori/Star: What does it mean to make invisible processes visible?
- Meadows/Alexander: How do we intervene in complex systems?

## Conclusion: From Design to Implementation

The VIRENS 101 development demonstrates that innovative composition pedagogy can be systematically documented, theoretically grounded, and practically implementable. The course integrates composition pedagogy with systems thinking not as parallel tracks but as mutually illuminating frameworks.

Key innovations documented and ready for classroom use:
- Fragment-based textual accumulation
- Constraint sequencing as explicit pedagogical tool
- Difficulty-as-diagnostic reframe
- Six-move vocabulary framework
- Permission flags for understanding access and agency
- Graph thinking vs. list thinking
- Corpse→compost→garden transformation arc

The 169 files constitute a complete course package: any instructor could adopt VIRENS 101 using these materials with minimal adaptation beyond local context adjustments.
