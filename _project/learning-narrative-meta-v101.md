## Overview: From Writer to System-Builder

This document narrates the student's journey through VIRENS 101, tracing how first-year writers transform from producers of isolated assignments into builders of personal intellectual infrastructure. Where the development narrative tells the story of course design, this companion document tells the story of learning—what students encounter, when they encounter it, and how their capabilities and perspectives shift across the semester.

The journey follows four movements: generating raw material (Surfacing), organizing what accumulates (Naming), managing growing complexity (Operating at Scale), and selecting and presenting work (Synthesis). By semester's end, students have produced 40-50 fragments, built systems for managing their intellectual work, and developed transferable processes they can name and adapt.

---

## Movement 1: Surfacing (Weeks 1-3)

### Week 1: The Envelope and the Fragment

Students arrive expecting a traditional composition course—discrete assignments, teacher-provided topics, fixed deadlines. The first week disrupts these expectations through two encounters:

**The Envelope Exercise**

In the opening class, students write responses to four questions: What do you hope to learn? What worries you about this course? What do you already know about writing? What do you expect college writing to be like? They seal these responses in envelopes addressed to themselves, not to be opened until Week 15.

This exercise plants a time capsule. Students won't know its significance until the semester's end, when the gap between their beginning hopes and ending realities becomes evidence of transformation.

**First Encounter: Kirschenbaum**

The first reading—Kirschenbaum's "Prepare for the Textpocalypse"—arrives before the syllabus review. Students encounter provocative claims about writing's material nature before settling into course logistics.

*Student experience*: Disorientation. Why are we reading about file formats and preservation before learning the assignment schedule? The sequence models the course's philosophy: generate before judging, encounter ideas before systematizing them.

**Concepts Introduced**

- **Six-move framework** (preview): Capture, Classify, Route, Distill, Connect, Publish—named as vocabulary students will develop, not skills they must immediately demonstrate
- **Writing-as-verb and writing-as-noun**: Labor (the doing) and capital (the accumulation)
- **Textual accumulation**: The course builds a corpus, not a sequence of disposable papers
- **Fragment**: The basic unit of production—one claim with supporting evidence, 150-400 words

*Student takeaway*: This course treats writing as material practice with nameable operations. Something different is happening here.

### Week 2: Building Systems

With orientation complete, students begin building the infrastructure that will support semester-long work.

**Tech Setup (T1-T2)**

Two blocks devoted to tool introduction:
- Index cards for analog capture (front: date, source, idea, tags; back: connections, questions)
- OneDrive folder structure for digital storage
- Eli Review orientation (ungraded familiarization)

Students set up their systems before they need them—familiarization without performance pressure.

**First Encounter: Ong [[@ong2012writi]]**

Walter Ong's "Writing Restructures Consciousness" introduces the idea that writing is technology—artificial, learned, transformative. Students read that "there is no way to write 'naturally'" and that technologies become "interior transformations of consciousness."

*Student experience*: Some resistance. Writing feels natural; the claim that it's artificial seems counterintuitive. But the framing connects to the tech setup happening simultaneously: tools shape thinking, and we're building tools this week.

**Concept Introduced: Graph Thinking**

Week 2's central concept: ideas as network, not list. The five-paragraph essay imposes linear structure; the fragment model allows associative connection. Students won't fully understand this until later, but the seed is planted.

*Student takeaway*: Writing requires infrastructure. The tools we use shape what we can think.

### Week 3: Difficulty as Doorway

The first "hard" week. Students encounter Salvatori's [[@salvatori1996conve]] "Conversations with Texts" and learn to reframe struggle.

**First Encounter: Salvatori**

Salvatori argues that difficulty in reading signals opportunity, not failure. Moments of confusion mark where real thinking can begin. Students learn to notice when they're confused and to treat that confusion as information.

This is **Difficulty Pair A, Part 1**. The pairing completes in Week 10 with Star's [[@star1999ethnp]] "Ethnography of Infrastructure"—both readings about making invisible processes visible.

**Concepts Introduced**

- **Difficulty-as-diagnostic**: Resistance is informational signal, not problem to eliminate
- **Metacognitive interruption**: Pause when confused; name the confusion; investigate it

**The Compression Exercise**

Students take an early fragment and compress it—reducing word count while preserving (or sharpening) the core claim. This constraint-based revision introduces distillation as a move, not just editing as error correction.

**Dev Log Begins**

Students start keeping development logs: What I did / What happened / What I learned. Twice weekly entries make process visible and create evidence for later reflection.

*Student takeaway*: Difficulty isn't failure—it's where learning happens. I need to document my process, not just my products.

---

## Movement 2: Naming (Weeks 4-7)

### Week 4: From Personal to Source-Based

Movement 2 marks a transition. Students have generated fragments from personal observation and course readings; now they learn to integrate outside sources.

**SEAR Procedure Introduced**

The mnemonic for source integration:
- **Situate**: Who's speaking, from what position?
- **Embed**: Make the source part of your sentence
- **Analyze**: Don't let the source speak for itself
- **Relate**: So what? Why does this matter here?

SEAR operationalizes what experienced writers do intuitively. Students practice with course readings before applying to research sources.

**First Encounter: Downs [[@downs2007teaci]]**

Downs's "Rhetoric" excerpt provides vocabulary for rhetorical situation—exigence, audience, constraints, genre. Students gain language for analyzing why texts work (or don't) in context.

**Literacy Narrative Due**

The first milestone assignment: personal narrative about a literacy experience, now revised through peer feedback. This culminates M1 work while bridging to M2's source-based focus.

**Eli Review Cycle 1**

First formal peer review using "Generous" protocol (Strengths, Potential, Questions). Students experience structured feedback before evaluative protocols arrive.

*Student takeaway*: Sources aren't decorations—they're participants in my argument. I have vocabulary now for what makes writing work rhetorically.

### Week 5: Systems Thinking Arrives

The course's systems thinking strand becomes explicit.

**First Encounter: Meadows [[@meadows2008lever]]**

Donella Meadows's "Leverage Points" introduces systems vocabulary: feedback loops, stocks and flows, delays, intervention points. Students learn that small changes at high-leverage points produce more effect than large changes at low-leverage points.

This is **Difficulty Pair B, Part 1**. The pairing completes in Week 7 with Alexander [[@alexander1964notet]].

**Concepts Introduced**

- **Leverage points**: Where in a system can intervention produce change?
- **Stocks and flows**: Accumulation (stocks) results from rates of change (flows). Students' corpora are stocks; fragment production is flow.

**Zotero Library Session (T3-T4)**

Students learn citation management: creating collections, installing Word plugin, understanding BEAM categories (Background, Exhibit, Argument, Method) for source classification.

**Spec Document Brainstorming**

Students begin planning their Specification Document—a genre borrowed from software development. They'll articulate intentions, constraints, and success criteria for a writing project.

*Student takeaway*: Writing exists within systems. Understanding leverage points helps me intervene effectively—in my own process and in the texts I analyze.

### Week 6: The Wunderkammer

A pivotal week introducing classification as intellectual work.

**First Encounter: Borges [[@borges1962labyr]] Cluster**

Students read Borges's "The Library of Babel," Quine's "Universal Library," and explore libraryofbabel.info. The readings present classification as both necessary and arbitrary—every system reveals and conceals.

**First Encounter: Jackson**

Shelley Jackson's "My Body—A Wunderkammer" demonstrates hypertext as organizational form. Non-linear structure embodies the graph thinking introduced in Week 2.

**Concepts Introduced**

- **Classification systems**: How we organize shapes what we can find and think
- **Experimental form**: Structure itself argues; form is not container but claim

**Corpse → Compost Introduced**

The transformation metaphor arrives: accumulated fragments are like a corpse—dead material that, with work, becomes compost (transformed, fertile) and eventually garden (growing, productive).

**BEAM Framework Applied**

Students categorize their accumulated sources: Which serve as Background? Which are Exhibits to analyze? Which make Arguments to engage? Which provide Methods to borrow?

**Spec Document Due**

The Specification Document—articulating intentions and constraints for a writing project—teaches students to plan before drafting and to name their choices explicitly.

*Student takeaway*: Organization isn't neutral. How I classify my fragments shapes what I can do with them. My corpus is becoming something I can work with, not just a pile.

### Week 7: Fit and Misfits

The most theoretically dense week. Alexander provides design vocabulary that reframes constraint.

**First Encounter: Alexander**

Christopher Alexander's *Notes on the Synthesis of Form* introduces:
- **Goodness of fit**: Design succeeds when form fits context
- **Misfits**: Points where form and context clash—the productive friction that demands attention

This completes **Difficulty Pair B**. Meadows (Week 5) asked where to intervene; Alexander asks how to recognize what needs intervention.

**Concepts Introduced**

- **Goodness of fit**: Success is achieved through fit, not through applying rules
- **Misfits**: Problems are where form and context clash
- **Constraint decomposition**: Complex problems become manageable through strategic constraint application

**Permission Flags (Preview)**

Light introduction to the Unix-derived framework: visible/invisible, modifiable/locked. Students encounter the vocabulary without full elaboration—that comes in Week 13.

**Eli Review Cycle 3: First Evaluative Protocol**

Shift from "Generous" (SPQ) to "Evaluative" (Describe-Evaluate-Suggest). Students learn to assess, not just appreciate. The protocol shift connects to Alexander: evaluative reading identifies misfits.

**Constraint Audit Due**

Students analyze constraints in a sample text—identifying which constraints enabled the writing and which created friction. They apply Alexander's vocabulary to rhetorical analysis.

*Student takeaway*: Constraints aren't obstacles—they're what make form possible. I can identify misfits in my own work and others'. The shift to evaluative feedback feels different; I'm learning to assess, not just encourage.

---

## Movement 3: Operating at Scale (Weeks 8-11)

### Week 8: Werewolves and Essential Complexity

M3 begins with a transition: students now have ~25 fragments. The challenge shifts from production to management.

**First Encounter: Brooks [[@brooks1986silve]]**

Fred Brooks's "No Silver Bullet" distinguishes essential complexity (inherent to the problem) from accidental complexity (created by our tools and approaches). Students learn that some difficulty can't be eliminated—only managed.

The werewolf metaphor: like the monster that can't be killed by ordinary means, some problems resist easy solutions.

**Concepts Introduced**

- **Essential vs. accidental complexity**: Which difficulties are inherent? Which did we create?
- **Graceful degradation**: Systems should fail partially, not catastrophically
- **Mill and store** (Babbage's terms): Processing (mill) vs. accumulation (store)

**"What You're Automating" (T5)**

Students learn what their digital tools actually do—not as abstract features but as operations on their accumulated work. The session title emphasizes agency: *you* are automating; the tools serve your purposes.

**BEAM Portfolio Entries Begin**

Students start drafting portfolio entries that integrate sources using BEAM categories. The portfolio becomes the primary project for M3.

*Student takeaway*: My corpus is big enough to feel unwieldy. That's not failure—it's success creating new challenges. Some complexity can't be eliminated; I need systems for managing it.

### Week 9: The Threshold (Conference Week)

No new content. Instead, individual 30-minute conferences with the instructor.

**Mid-Semester Reflection Due**

Before conferences, students complete a 500-750 word reflection identifying 3 growth patterns and 2 areas needing development, with specific evidence from their process documentation.

**Conference Structure**

Conferences address:
- Corpus review: What have you accumulated? What patterns emerge?
- Process assessment: What's working? What needs adjustment?
- Second-half planning: What will you focus on in M3-M4?

Students bring their mid-semester reflection as preparation.

*Student experience*: Pause and assessment. The conference creates space to step back from production and examine the whole. Many students realize they've produced more than they recognized.

*Student takeaway*: I can see patterns in my own work when I look at the whole corpus. The second half of the semester has clearer direction because I've named what I'm doing.

### Week 10: Infrastructure Becomes Visible

The semester's most concept-dense week.

**First Encounter: Star**

Susan Leigh Star's "Ethnography of Infrastructure" argues that infrastructure is invisible until it breaks. Students see their own writing systems as infrastructure—taken for granted when working, frustrating when failing.

This completes **Difficulty Pair A**. Salvatori (Week 3) introduced difficulty as diagnostic for reading; Star extends it to systems: breakdown reveals structure.

**First Encounter: Bush [[@bush1945thinl]]**

Vannevar Bush's "As We May Think" (1945) imagines the memex—a device for storing, linking, and retrieving personal knowledge. Students recognize their own systems as memex descendants.

**Concepts Introduced**

- **Infrastructure invisibility**: Working systems disappear from view
- **Boundary objects**: Objects that coordinate different communities without requiring agreement
- **Memex vision**: Personal knowledge systems with associative trails

**Graph Thinking Returns**

Bush's "associative trails" connect to Week 2's graph thinking. Students now have accumulated material to link—the concept becomes operational.

**Eli Review Cycle 5**

Returns to "Generous" protocol after evaluative cycles. Students experience the rhythm: different protocols serve different purposes at different stages.

*Student takeaway*: I've been building infrastructure all semester without calling it that. When my systems work, I don't notice them. Star and Bush help me see what I've made.

### Week 11: Maintenance Labor

**First Encounter: Ribes [[@ribes2013datb]] & Jackson**

"Data Bite Man" introduces maintenance as skilled labor—the ongoing work required to keep systems functioning. Students recognize that their corpus requires maintenance, not just initial creation.

**Concept Introduced**

- **Maintenance labor**: Systems require ongoing work to remain functional

**Distill Move Foregrounded**

The six-move framework's "Distill" operation becomes central. Students practice extracting essential claims from their accumulated fragments—preparing material for portfolio selection.

**BEAM Portfolio Due**

The major M3 deliverable: portfolio entries demonstrating source integration across BEAM categories.

*Student takeaway*: Building a system isn't enough—I have to maintain it. The distillation work feels different from earlier production; I'm working *with* accumulated material, not just adding to it.

---

## Movement 4: Synthesis (Weeks 12-15)

### Week 12: Design Vocabulary

M4 begins the turn toward portfolio—selecting, polishing, presenting.

**First Encounter: Norman [[@norman2013desig]]**

Don Norman's "Psychopathology of Everyday Things" provides design vocabulary: affordances (what actions an object invites), signifiers (signals about how to act), constraints (what limits options), feedback (responses to action).

Students apply this vocabulary to their own writing systems in the Process Archaeology assignment.

**Concept Introduced**

- **Affordances**: What does my system invite me to do? What does it make difficult?

**M3→M4 Transition**

The shift from "operating" to "synthesizing." Students have managed their corpus; now they select from it. The question changes from "what should I add?" to "what should I present?"

**Process Archaeology Begins**

Students analyze their own writing systems using Norman's vocabulary. What affordances does your folder structure create? What constraints shape your revision process? What feedback do you receive (or lack)?

*Student takeaway*: Design vocabulary applies to my own systems. I can analyze why my process works (or doesn't) using the same terms I'd use for a door handle or a website.

### Week 13: Revision as Meaning-Making

**First Encounter: Bernstein**

Charles Bernstein's "Blood on the Cutting Room Floor" reframes revision as construction, not correction. Cutting creates meaning; the removed material ("blood") is evidence of compositional choices.

**Concepts Introduced**

- **Revision as meaning-making**: Revision constructs; it doesn't just fix

**Permission Flags (Full Treatment)**

The Unix model made explicit:
- **Visible/Invisible**: Who can see this work?
- **Readable/Writable**: Who can respond to or modify this work?
- **Owner/Group/Others**: How do permissions expand through sharing?

Students trace how their semester followed a permission trajectory: from private drafts (full write access, no readers) through peer review (read access granted to group) to portfolio (visible to instructor, becoming part of academic record).

**Burke's Parlor**

Kenneth Burke's "unending conversation" metaphor frames the portfolio: students enter an ongoing discussion, listen, contribute, and leave while the conversation continues. The "publish" move is cyclical—you publish to re-enter, not to conclude.

**Documented Inquiry Due**

Major analytical project demonstrating six-move framework mastery: capturing sources, classifying with BEAM, routing to appropriate sections, distilling claims, connecting across texts, publishing coherent argument.

*Student takeaway*: Permission flags name what's been happening all semester—my relationship to audience has shifted. Revision isn't about fixing errors; it's about constructing meaning through selection.

### Week 14: Presentations

All six blocks devoted to student presentations of portfolio work. Students share selections and explain their choices.

No new readings or concepts. The week creates space for public articulation of learning.

*Student experience*: Performance of accumulated capability. Presenting requires students to articulate not just what they wrote but why they selected it and what it demonstrates.

### Week 15: The Envelope Returns

The semester's bookend. Students complete the arc that began Week 1.

**Envelope Exercise Returns**

Before opening their sealed envelopes, students write responses to parallel questions: What surprised you about this course? What was most difficult? What skills did you develop? What would you do differently?

Only then do they open the Week 1 envelopes. The gap between beginning hopes and ending realities becomes visible evidence of transformation.

**Portfolio Cover Letter Due**

The major reflective assignment: 1,500-2,000 words demonstrating all seven course outcomes with specific evidence from process documentation. Students cite their dev logs, reference their corpus statistics, point to specific fragments as evidence.

**Transfer Proposal**

Students articulate how course processes might transfer to other contexts. The constraint sequencing vocabulary—when to generate, when to evaluate, when to share—becomes portable.

**Reading: Lamott**

Anne Lamott's "Shitty First Drafts" arrives last, not first. Students recognize what they've been practicing all semester: permission to generate imperfect material because revision transforms it.

*Student experience*: Recognition and retrospection. The envelope gap, the reflection, the Lamott reading—all create opportunities to see the semester whole. Students name what they've learned in terms the course provided.

*Student takeaway*: I started with hopes and worries I'd mostly forgotten. The distance between then and now is larger than I realized. The processes I've learned—generating before judging, documenting as I go, using constraints productively—aren't just for this class.

---

## Transformations: What Changes Across the Semester

### Relationship to Difficulty

**Week 1**: Difficulty signals failure; something is wrong with me or the text.

**Week 15**: Difficulty signals opportunity; confusion marks where thinking can begin.

### Relationship to Process

**Week 1**: Process is invisible; "I just write."

**Week 15**: Process is documented, nameable, adjustable; "I capture, then classify, then..."

### Relationship to Accumulation

**Week 1**: Each assignment is discrete; writing is disposable.

**Week 15**: Fragments accumulate into corpus; writing is capital.

### Relationship to Constraints

**Week 1**: Constraints are impositions; they limit what I can do.

**Week 15**: Constraints are enabling; they make certain forms possible.

### Relationship to Systems

**Week 1**: No awareness of systems; tools are transparent.

**Week 15**: Systems are visible infrastructure requiring maintenance; tools shape thinking.

### Relationship to Audience

**Week 1**: Writing is private until submitted; audience is teacher-as-evaluator.

**Week 15**: Writing moves through permission stages; audiences vary and expand.

| 3 | Difficulty-as-diagnostic, metacognitive interruption | "Confusion is informational, not shameful" |
| 4 | SEAR, rhetorical situation | "I have procedures for working with sources" |
| 5 | Leverage points, stocks/flows | "My corpus is a stock; production is flow" |
| 6 | Classification systems, experimental form | "How I organize affects what I can think" |
| 7 | Goodness of fit, misfits, constraints | "Problems are where form and context clash" |
| 8 | Essential vs. accidental complexity, graceful degradation | "Some difficulty can't be eliminated" |
| 9 | — (Conference) | "I can see patterns in my accumulated work" |
| 10 | Infrastructure invisibility, boundary objects, memex vision | "I've been building infrastructure" |
| 11 | Maintenance labor | "Systems require ongoing work" |
| 12 | Affordances | "Design vocabulary applies to my systems" |
| 13 | Revision as meaning-making, permission flags | "Cutting creates; sharing follows stages" |
| 14 | — (Presentations) | "I can articulate what I've learned" |
| 15 | — (Envelope/Portfolio) | "The distance I've traveled is visible now" |

---

## Difficulty Pairs: The Student's Experience

### Pair A: Visibility/Surfacing

**Salvatori (Week 3)**: Learning to notice confusion in reading, to pause and investigate rather than push through or give up.

**Star (Week 10)**: Recognizing that the writing systems I've built are infrastructure—invisible when working, frustrating when breaking.

**Connection students make**: Both readings are about making invisible things visible. Salvatori focuses on mental processes; Star focuses on material systems. Both require attention to what's usually overlooked.

### Pair B: Intervention/Fit

**Meadows (Week 5)**: Understanding that systems have leverage points where small changes produce large effects.

**Alexander (Week 7)**: Learning that design succeeds through fit between form and context, and that misfits signal where intervention is needed.

**Connection students make**: Meadows asks where to intervene; Alexander asks how to recognize what needs intervention. Together they provide a complete intervention framework.

---

## The Corpse → Compost → Garden Arc

**Weeks 1-5 (Corpse)**: Students generate fragments that feel like dead material—notes, observations, drafts that pile up without obvious purpose. The corpus is a corpse: accumulation without transformation.

**Weeks 6-9 (Compost)**: Classification, BEAM organization, constraint work. Students begin transforming raw material—routing fragments to categories, distilling claims, connecting across texts. The corpus becomes compost: dead matter transforming into fertile medium.

**Weeks 10-15 (Garden)**: Portfolio development, maintenance, selection. Students cultivate what's grown from composted material—choosing what to present, polishing selected pieces, documenting process. The portfolio is a garden: living, growing, tended.

**Week 15**: "The planted garden grows." Students recognize their portfolio as a snapshot of current flourishing, not a final product. The garden continues after the course ends.

---

## Permission Flags: The Access Trajectory

| Stage | Permission State | Course Moment |
|-------|------------------|---------------|
| Private draft | Full write, no read | Early fragments (W1-3) |
| Peer review | Read access to group | Eli cycles begin (W4) |
| Instructor feedback | Read + evaluate access | Conferences (W9), feedback |
| Portfolio | Visible to institution | Final submission (W15) |
| Beyond course | Public/transferable | Transfer proposal |

Students experience this trajectory without initially naming it. Week 13's explicit permission flags treatment helps them see the pattern: their relationship to audience has systematically shifted.

---

## Parallel to Development Narrative

| Development Stage | Learning Stage | Shared Focus |
|-------------------|----------------|--------------|
| Stage 1: Foundational Theory | Week 1: Framework introduction | Vocabulary establishment |
| Stage 2: Movement Structure | Weeks 1-3: M1 experience | Surfacing as practice |
| Stage 3: Tech/Assessment | Week 2 + ongoing | Infrastructure building |
| Stage 4: Policies | Throughout (as needed) | Navigating constraints |
| Stage 5: Outcomes | Throughout (implicit) | Capability development |
| Stage 6: Reflection | W3, W9, W13, W15 | Metacognitive pauses |
| Stage 7: Readings | Each week | Concept encounters |
| Stage 8: Weekly structure | Each week | Rhythm experience |
| Stage 9: Reading finalization | Across movements | Reading as transformation driver |

The development narrative describes building the course; the learning narrative describes living through it. Both follow similar arcs: establish foundations, build structures, manage complexity, synthesize and present.

---

## Conclusion: From Writer to System-Builder

Students enter VIRENS 101 as writers expecting to produce papers. They leave as system-builders who have:

- **Produced**: 40-50 fragments, multiple revised pieces, a curated portfolio
- **Built**: Personal infrastructure for capturing, organizing, and developing ideas
- **Learned**: Vocabulary for naming what they do (six moves, BEAM, SEAR, constraint sequencing)
- **Developed**: Transferable processes documented well enough to adapt to new contexts
- **Shifted**: From seeing writing as isolated performance to seeing it as ongoing system

The envelope exercise captures this transformation materially: the same person, 15 weeks apart, with documented evidence of the distance traveled.

What began as a composition course ends as a course in building and maintaining intellectual infrastructure—with composition as the occasion for learning.
