## Synthesis

We start by writing. Not by talking about writing, not by reviewing policies, not by going over the syllabus—we start by putting words on paper, by hand, with the clock running. There's a reason for this. The most important thing I can tell you about this course is that writing is a practice of accumulation: you build a body of work, fragment by fragment, and that body of work becomes intellectual capital you can draw on for the rest of the semester and beyond. The six moves you'll learn—capture, classify, route, distill, connect, publish—are how raw material becomes usable infrastructure. But none of that matters if you don't generate the raw material first. So we generate.

The envelope exercise you'll do on day one is a kind of time capsule. You'll write answers to four questions about your hopes, fears, existing knowledge, and expectations for this course—and then you'll seal the envelope and hand it to me. You won't see it again until Week 15, when I'll hand it back after you've written a parallel set of responses. The gap between those two documents—what you expected versus what actually happened—becomes evidence you can use to trace your own trajectory. This isn't busywork or icebreaker nonsense. It's the first fragment in your corpus, even though you won't initially count it as one. Later in the semester, you'll return to it, revise it, expand it—watching your own thinking transform is part of the work.

The envelope embodies a principle we'll return to throughout the course: [[yolo-up-constrain-down-course-v101|YOLO up, constrain down]]. Write first, without judgment—that's YOLO mode. The constraints come later, when the semester's work reveals what was actually possible. The sealed envelope creates a protected space for aspiration before reality arrives.

One of those envelope questions asks what you're most worried about. I want to name something important about that question: we're not asking so we can fix your worries or make them go away. We're asking because difficulty tells us something. Throughout this course, when something feels hard—a reading that resists you, a draft that won't come together, a concept that seems slippery—that's information, not failure. Struggle reveals where assumptions live, where knowledge has gaps, where the interesting problems actually are. The envelope captures your worries not as weaknesses to overcome but as data about where you're starting. We'll return to that data.

Here's where things get complicated. This week's reading is Matthew Kirschenbaum's "Prepare for the Textpocalypse," and it asks an uncomfortable question: what happens when there's too much text? When AI systems can generate endless prose, when every platform demands constant content, when the sheer volume of words in the world becomes overwhelming—what's the point of writing more? I'll admit that I find this question genuinely unsettling. If you're taking a writing class in an age of textual oversaturation, you deserve to know what you're doing and why.

But here's the thing: the same mechanisms that make textual abundance dangerous are also what make it powerful. The response to overwhelming abundance isn't to build bigger filing cabinets or more elaborate hierarchies—it's to think in terms of connections. Networks, not ladders. Links, not categories. A corpus of fragments that you've captured, classified, and connected isn't just more text in the flood—it's infrastructure you can navigate, material you can return to, build on, recombine. This course treats the graph—the web of connections between things—as the fundamental structure, not the outline or the folder tree. You'll see this principle show up again and again: in how we organize fragments, in how citations work, in how ideas travel and transform. The practices we'll develop aren't about contributing to the textpocalypse; they're about learning to operate within it, to make the accumulation work for you rather than drowning you. Kirschenbaum's piece is a warning, but it's also a map.

By the end of this week, we'll look at the syllabus, the policies, the assignment sequence—all the administrative apparatus that makes a course function. I know the stereotype of "syllabus week" as dead time where nothing real happens. We're going to flip that. The administrative documents aren't obstacles to the real work; they're specifications, constraints that structure what's possible. Understanding them is part of understanding how systems operate. But we don't start there. We start by writing.

## Reading

**This Week**: [[reading-kirschenbaum-textpocalypse-course-v101|Kirschenbaum, "Prepare for the Textpocalypse"]] (~5 pages)

**Key Concepts**:
- Textual abundance as both danger and power
- AI-generated text and the changing landscape of writing
- The question of why write when text is everywhere
- Infrastructure as response to overwhelm

**Connection to Activities**: Kirschenbaum frames the problem that the course's practices respond to. The envelope exercise and early fragment work begin building the infrastructure that makes accumulation navigable rather than overwhelming.

**Difficulty Notes**: This is a contemporary, accessible piece—a hook rather than a challenge. The difficulty readings begin Week 3 with Salvatori.

### Block Details

#### Block 1: Course Introduction

**Type**: —

**Duration**: 25 minutes

**Materials**: Syllabus (printed or projected), course schedule overview

**Opening** (5 min): Introduce yourself. Name the course's central premise: writing is a practice of accumulation, and this course builds infrastructure for that accumulation.

**Main Activity** (15 min): Walk through syllabus—but frame it as _specifications_ and _constraints_ rather than bureaucratic requirements. Emphasize: the syllabus tells you what's possible, not just what's required. Highlight the portfolio structure, the fragment system, the four movements.

**Closing** (5 min): Preview the envelope exercise. Explain that we start by writing, not by talking about writing. Distribute envelopes and index cards for Block 2.

**Connection**: Establishes course framework; supports [[outcome-4-constraint-literacy]]

---

#### Block 2: Envelope Exercise (Part 1)

**Type**: W

**Duration**: 25 minutes

**Materials**: Blank envelopes (one per student), index cards (4 per student), pens

**Opening** (3 min): Explain the envelope exercise: four questions, four cards, sealed and returned Week 15. Emphasize privacy—"you will be the only one who sees this." Name the four questions:
1. What do you already know about writing?
2. What do you hope to learn?
3. What are you most worried about?
4. What do you expect this course to be like?

**Main Activity** (18 min): Students write responses on index cards. Encourage honest, unfiltered writing—no grades, no judgment. This is baseline data, not performance.

**Closing** (4 min): Have students seal their envelopes with all four cards inside. Collect envelopes. Store securely for Week 15 return.

**Connection**: First fragment production; supports [[outcome-7-process-documentation]] and [[outcome-1-composing-processes]]

---

#### Block 3: Envelope Freewriting

**Type**: W

**Duration**: 25 minutes

**Materials**: Paper or notebooks, pens

**Opening** (3 min): Transition from the sealed envelope to open freewriting. Prompt: "You just wrote about what you know, hope, fear, and expect. Now write about _why_ you have those answers. Where do they come from? What experiences shaped them?"

**Main Activity** (18 min): Uninterrupted freewriting. No stopping, no editing, no looking back. Keep the pen moving. If stuck, write "I'm stuck" until something else comes.

**Closing** (4 min): Brief reflection (not sharing): "Look at what you wrote. Circle one sentence that surprises you or that you might want to return to." Explain that this freewriting is raw material—it may become a fragment, or it may just be warm-up. Both are valuable.

**Connection**: Freewriting as generative practice; supports [[outcome-1-composing-processes]]

---

#### Block 4: First Fragment Capture

**Type**: W

**Duration**: 25 minutes

**Materials**: Paper or notebooks, Prompt 1.4 handout (optional)

**Opening** (5 min): Introduce the fragment concept: 150-400 words, a unit of thought that can stand alone but also connect to other fragments. Introduce Prompt 1.4 ("Campus Observation") as one option, but clarify that students can also write on any topic that emerged from the envelope freewriting.

**Main Activity** (17 min): Students draft their first fragment. Encourage them to aim for the 150-400 word range but not obsess about it yet. The goal is _capture_—getting something down that can be developed later.

**Closing** (3 min): Quick self-assessment: "Do you have something you could return to? Something that could become more?" Explain that this is what fragment capture feels like—not finished, but _started_.

**Connection**: First official fragment; introduces [[outcome-5-textual-accumulation]]

---

#### Block 5: Fragment Development

**Type**: W

**Duration**: 25 minutes

**Materials**: Paper or notebooks, Prompt 1.2 handout (optional)

**Opening** (3 min): Options for this block: continue developing the fragment from Block 4, start a new fragment using Prompt 1.2 ("Technological Literacy"), or freewrite toward a different topic entirely. All are valid.

**Main Activity** (19 min): Writing time. Circulate and observe but don't interrupt. Note who's flowing and who's stuck—this is diagnostic information for you, not intervention time.

**Closing** (3 min): Check in: "How many of you have at least 150 words of something?" "How many have more than one thing started?" Normalize variation—some students will have two fragments, some will have half of one. Both are fine for Week 1.

**Connection**: Continued fragment production; supports [[outcome-1-composing-processes]]

---

#### Block 6: Fragment Development (Continued)

**Type**: W

**Duration**: 25 minutes

**Materials**: Paper or notebooks

**Opening** (3 min): Final writing block of the week. Encourage students to either push one fragment toward completion (300+ words) or to start something new. Preview that next week, we'll set up the digital systems for storing and organizing this material.

**Main Activity** (18 min): Writing time. Same approach as Block 5—observe, don't intervene.

**Closing** (4 min): Wrap-up for the week. Remind students of the reading (Kirschenbaum) and that next week begins with more writing but also introduces the organizational tools. Ask them to bring their fragments (paper is fine for now). End with: "You've started. That's the hardest part."

**Connection**: Fragment accumulation; prepares for [[week02-overview-course-v101]] tech setup

## Instructor Notes

### Facilitation Tips

- **Envelope exercise tone**: Keep it light but genuine. Students may be suspicious of "icebreaker" activities. Emphasize that this is data they'll use, not performance for you.
- **Freewriting resistance**: Some students freeze when told to write without stopping. Normalize "I'm stuck I'm stuck I'm stuck" as valid text. The point is keeping the pen moving, not producing brilliance.
- **Fragment anxiety**: Students may worry about the 150-400 word target. Reassure them that this week is about _starting_, not finishing. The word count becomes more important as the system develops.
- **Syllabus as constraint**: When reviewing the syllabus, use the language of "specifications" and "constraints" to preview course vocabulary. This isn't just bureaucracy—it's the first model of how constraints structure possibility.

### Flexibility Points

- **Block 5-6 are interchangeable**: If students need more time on first fragments, both blocks can focus on development. If they're ready for variety, introduce Prompt 1.2 in Block 5.
- **Paper vs. digital**: Some students may want to type. For Week 1, gently encourage handwriting—it removes the temptation to edit and reinforces that the systems come later. But don't die on this hill.
- **Kirschenbaum discussion**: The reading is assigned but not formally discussed until it surfaces in Week 2. If students want to talk about it, let them—but don't force it.

### What's Locked

- **Envelope exercise**: Must happen Blocks 2-3. This creates the Week 15 return structure.
- **Writing-first orientation**: Block 1 is administrative, but Blocks 2-6 must be writing. Don't let logistics eat into writing time.

### Evidence to Collect

- How many students complete the envelope exercise without visible anxiety?
- How many students produce at least one fragment draft by end of week?
- What topics emerge in open freewriting? (diagnostic for prompt development)
- Who freezes during freewriting? (may need additional support)
