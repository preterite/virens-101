## This Week's Place in the Course

Week 13 brings together the course's major conceptual threads as students complete Process Archaeology and continue portfolio assembly. Bernstein's "Blood on the Cutting Room Floor" provides the central concept **revision as meaning-making**—writing as "psychic surgery" that animates dead material into living text. The week gives **permission flags** its full treatment, connecting the Unix concept explicitly to how student work has moved through visibility, shareability, and ownership states across the semester.

The corpse→compost→garden arc reaches its flourishing stage: the planted garden is growing. But Bernstein's emphasis on cyclical process (and Burke's "unending conversation") resists treating this as an endpoint—publish feeds back into capture, the parlor conversation continues after you depart.

**Key completions**: Process Archaeology due; six-move vocabulary culminates in "publish" (framed as cyclical, not terminal); permission flags fully articulated.

## Synthesis

We've been tracing a transformation across the semester. What began as notes—raw fragments, unconnected captures—became productive through the care and turning you've practiced: classifying, routing, distilling, connecting. This week, I'd like to start with a startling metaphor from Charles Bernstein: "writing is an artificial intelligence—*intelligence* in the sense of having a power over mind, *artificial* in the sense of transpersonal and nonhuman (it neither breathes nor bleeds, nor ever has, though its origins issue from flesh and blood). To understand language as artificial intelligence is to conceptualize writing as a kind of psychic surgery—knitting together pieces of deanimated flesh until, like the monster in Mary Shelley's *Frankenstein*, they come alive." This is not gentle imagery. Texts as stitched-together limbs, finished works as golems, writing as psychic surgery—Bernstein refuses to domesticate what happens when revision animates material.

Bernstein asks: "Consider a work composed of a number of autonomously distinct pieces, which nonetheless functions as a whole by articulating the relations among the parts: that is, has an overall configuration whose music is composed of differences. But what are the possibilities for a whole that is not constructed along narrative or overtly thematic/historical lines?" This question matters for portfolio assembly. Your portfolio is composed of autonomously distinct pieces—fragments, BEAM entries, the Documented Inquiry, process documentation. They weren't written as parts of a single argument. Yet they can function as a whole if you articulate the relations among them. The portfolio's music is composed of differences: different genres, different moments, different purposes, now configured into something that demonstrates your development as a writer.

This is where the optional tools connect. Voyant, the TAPoR suite, and similar text analysis tools permit this kind of reconfiguration—taking autonomously distinct pieces and visualizing their relations, finding patterns across documents that you couldn't see when each piece was separate. Psychic surgery is the manipulation of material according to flagged constraints: what can be cut, what can be moved, what must stay, what can be recombined. Digital tools extend the surgeon's reach, making visible connections that close reading might miss.

In Unix systems, permission flags both make visible and determine who can do what with a file: read it, write to it, execute it. The flags are three sets of three—owner, group, others—each specifying read/write/execute permissions. A file might be readable by everyone but writable only by you. The flags can change: you might share a document as read-only, then grant editing access later.

Writing has permission flags. Your early fragments were fully writeable—you could change anything because they belonged only to you. Peer-reviewed drafts became partly shared; others could read them, comment on them, but not change your words directly. Published work—what you submit for the portfolio—becomes fixed in a different way, owned by you, but now readable by instructor and institution. The Process Archaeology assignment asks you to examine how your permission flags changed across the semester. When did material move from private to shared? When did feedback arrive, and what did you do with that read access others had to your work? When did you lock something in, deciding it was done enough to submit?

Permission flags also encode power relations. Early in the semester, you had full write access to your fragments but limited read access to scholarly sources—you were learning how to enter conversations already in progress. By now, you've developed read access to academic discourse (you can understand how sources function, can analyze their rhetoric) and write access to scholarly genres (you can produce academic documents, can engage sources dialogically). The semester has been a gradual expansion of permissions or constraint: from reading to writing, from isolated work to shared work, from rough capture to polished publication.

"Publish" is not the final move. Publications get quoted, cited, recycled. What you publish enters circulation, becoming material for others' capture, classification, routing. The cycle continues: produce, distribute, use, reproduce. Kenneth Burke called this the "unending conversation":

> Imagine that you enter a parlor. You come late. When you arrive, others have long preceded you, and they are engaged in a heated discussion, a discussion too heated for them to pause and tell you exactly what it is about.... You listen for a while, until you decide that you have caught the tenor of the argument; then you put in your oar. Someone answers; you answer him; another comes to your defense; another aligns himself against you.... The hour grows late, you must depart. And you depart, with the discussion still vigorously in progress.

In Week 3, Salvatori's [[@salvatori1996conve]] "Conversations with Texts" positioned learning to read as entry into ongoing dialogue. Now you're preparing to contribute: publishing work that enters the parlor, available for others to answer, extend, dispute. The portfolio is not the end but a stop, a snapshot of a stage in a continuing process. Your fragments will generate future fragments. Gardens don't stop growing when you harvest, and gardens require continued tending. The flourishing you've cultivated this semester—the systems, the habits, the accumulated material—needs ongoing care. What you've learned about capturing, classifying, routing, distilling, connecting, and publishing remains yours, but how you apply those moves will depend on what each new situation affords and constrains. The Process Archaeology assignment asks you to document what's flourishing now so you can recognize it later, tend it deliberately, adjust when new conditions arrive.

Bernstein's title gives us one more image: "The poem carries in its music the marks of its continual newness in being made, the only mark of its past, of its having been made, is the blood on the cutting room floor." The finished work shows its presence—alive, moving, functioning. But the evidence of its making lies in what remains: your development logs, the feedback you incorporated or ignored, your revised fragments, your discarded drafts. Process Archaeology excavates that evidence, making visible the surgery that produced the living text. The portfolio shows what survived; the archaeology shows what it cost.

The planted garden grows. What you tend now shapes what flourishes next.

## Reading

### Primary Text

**Charles Bernstein, "Blood on the Cutting Room Floor"** (~10-15 pages)

From the collection *What Is a Poet?* (ed. Hank Lazer), this essay proposes writing as "psychic surgery"—assembling pieces of deanimated material until they come alive. Bernstein draws on Mary Shelley's *Frankenstein* to describe what happens when revision transforms fragments into functioning wholes. The essay also examines part-to-whole relations, asking how autonomously distinct pieces can function together without imposed thematic unity.

**Reading focus**: Pay attention to Bernstein's metaphors—what does it mean to think of writing as surgery? As animation? As stitching corpse parts? How does this imagery change what you think revision does?

### Connecting to Course Concepts

Bernstein completes several conceptual arcs:

| Prior Concept | Bernstein Connection |
|---------------|---------------------|
| Corpse→compost→garden (W6, W8, W11, W12) | "Deanimated flesh" coming alive = garden flourishing |
| Six-move vocabulary (W1→W13) | Publish as entry into circulation, not endpoint |
| Difficulty-as-diagnostic (W3, W5, W7) | "Blood on the cutting room floor" = evidence of difficulty overcome |
| Permission flags (W7 preview) | Full treatment: who can read/write/execute your work |
| Norman's affordances (W12) | Psychic surgery = manipulation according to flagged constraints |

---

### Revision as Meaning-Making

**Definition**: Revision is not correction but transformation—the process by which assembled material becomes something more than its parts. Bernstein's "psychic surgery" metaphor emphasizes that revision animates: it takes dead material (fragments, notes, drafts) and produces living text that functions independently.

**Key insight**: What distinguishes animation from mere collection is the work of articulating relations among parts. Your portfolio's pieces weren't written together, but revision makes them function together—"a whole by articulating the relations among the parts."

**Application to Process Archaeology**: The assignment asks you to excavate the evidence of this surgery—what was cut, moved, transformed. The "blood on the cutting room floor" is the material record of revision's work.

**Key quotation**: "To understand language as artificial intelligence is to conceptualize writing as a kind of psychic surgery—knitting together pieces of deanimated flesh until, like the monster in Mary Shelley's *Frankenstein*, they come alive" (Bernstein 135).

### Permission Flags (Full Treatment)

**Definition**: Borrowed from Unix file systems, permission flags describe who can do what with a piece of writing: read it (view), write it (modify), execute it (act on it). Flags exist for owner, group, and others—and they change over time.

**The Unix model**:
```
rwx rwx rwx
│   │   └── others (everyone else)
│   └────── group (peers, classmates)
└────────── owner (you)

r = read (can view)
w = write (can modify)
x = execute (can act on/run)
```

**Application to writing**:

| Stage | Owner | Group | Others |
|-------|-------|-------|--------|
| **Early fragment** | rwx | --- | --- |
| **Peer review draft** | rwx | r-- | --- |
| **Submitted work** | rw- | r-- | r-- |
| **Published portfolio** | r-- | r-- | r-- |

Note how permissions shift: early work is fully modifiable by you alone; peer review grants read access to classmates; submission grants read access to instructor; publication potentially grants read access to wider audiences. Note also how your *own* permissions change—published work becomes harder for even you to modify.

**Power dimension**: Permission flags encode who has access to what. Your expanding read access to academic discourse (understanding sources) and write access to scholarly genres (producing academic work) represents skill development as permission expansion.

**Process Archaeology connection**: The assignment asks you to trace how permission flags changed across the semester—when did work become shared? When did you lock things in? What does the pattern reveal about your composing process?

---

### Publish (Six-Move Completion)

**Definition**: Generate outputs from accumulated material for circulation. But "publish" is not terminal—it feeds back into the cycle. Published work becomes material others capture, classify, route.

**The full cycle**:
```
capture → classify → route → distill → connect → publish
                                                    ↓
                                            [enters circulation]
                                                    ↓
                                    becomes material for others' capture...
```

**Burke's parlor**: Publication is entering the conversation, not ending it. You depart, but the discussion continues. Your published work becomes available for others to answer, extend, dispute—and for your future self to revisit, revise, redeploy.

**Application**: The portfolio is a stop, not a destination. What you publish this semester becomes raw material for future work—in other courses, in other contexts, in ongoing intellectual development.

## Block-by-Block Plan

### Block 1 (R): Documented Inquiry Revision

**Opening** (3 min): Orient to Week 13's dual focus: completing Process Archaeology and continuing portfolio assembly. Today focuses on Documented Inquiry revision—bringing the major M4 writing project toward polish.

**Main** (20 min): Deep revision on Documented Inquiry. Priorities:
- Argument clarity: Is your inquiry's trajectory clear to readers?
- Source integration: Are sources functioning dialogically, not just decoratively?
- Process visibility: Does the piece show how your thinking evolved?

**Closing** (2 min): Identify one section that still needs significant work. Process Archaeology development continues Block 2.

---

### Block 2 (R): Process Archaeology Development

**Opening** (3 min): Shift to Process Archaeology. This assignment excavates your own composing process using evidence from your archived work and Norman's [[@norman2013desig]] design vocabulary.

**Main** (20 min): Process Archaeology drafting. Key moves:
- Review dev logs, fragments, feedback records for evidence
- Identify patterns: What practices recurred? What changed?
- Apply Norman vocabulary: What did your workflow afford? Constrain?
- Trace permission flag changes: When did work become shared? Fixed?

**Closing** (2 min): Process Archaeology due this week. Identify what evidence you still need to gather.

---

### Block 3 (T6): Optional Advanced Tools Demo

**Opening** (5 min): Introduce optional advanced tools for text analysis and visualization. These tools connect to Bernstein's question about "autonomously distinct pieces" functioning as wholes—they help you see relations across documents.

**Main** (18 min): Demo and exploration of:
- **Voyant Tools** (voyant-tools.org): Word frequency, trends across documents, visualization
- **TAPoR** (tapor.ca): Text analysis portal with multiple analysis options
- **Optional VIRENS overview**: How the professional system this course adapts handles similar tasks

**Focus question**: How might these tools support "psychic surgery"—seeing connections, identifying patterns, visualizing the relations among your portfolio pieces?

**Closing** (2 min): These tools are optional but available. Students interested in digital humanities or text analysis can explore further independently.

---

### Block 4 (R): Portfolio Assembly

**Opening** (2 min): Shift to portfolio assembly work. The portfolio is "autonomously distinct pieces" that must function as a whole—your task is articulating the relations among them.

**Main** (21 min): Portfolio assembly work:
- Organize materials: What goes where? What's the sequence?
- Draft connective tissue: How will you frame the relations among pieces?
- Check completeness: Do you have all required components?
- Consider permission flags: What's ready to be "fixed" (submitted)?

**Closing** (2 min): Identify any gaps in portfolio materials. Instructor feedback session follows.

---

### Block 5 (I): Instructor Feedback on Portfolio Drafts

**Opening** (3 min): Overview of feedback session. Instructor circulates for individual consultations on portfolio progress while students continue assembly work.

**Main** (20 min): Instructor feedback rotation. While waiting:
- Continue portfolio assembly
- Refine Process Archaeology based on evidence review
- Draft reflective cover letter notes (due Week 15)

**Closing** (2 min): Identify priority actions based on feedback. Process Archaeology due end of week.

---

### Block 6 (R): Continue Portfolio Assembly

**Opening** (2 min): Final assembly work for Week 13. Emphasis on completing Process Archaeology and advancing portfolio toward presentation-ready state.

**Main** (21 min): Continued assembly and revision:
- Finalize Process Archaeology for submission
- Continue portfolio organization
- Draft presentation notes (presentations Week 14)

**Closing** (2 min): Process Archaeology submission reminder. Look ahead to presentations (Week 14) and final portfolio (Week 15).

## Assignments

### Process Archaeology (Due This Week)

**Description**: Evidence-based analysis of your composing process using archived work (dev logs, fragments, feedback, drafts) and Norman's design vocabulary. Identify patterns in your practices, trace permission flag changes, articulate what your workflow afforded and constrained.

**Connection to Week 13**: Bernstein's "blood on the cutting room floor" is what Process Archaeology excavates—the evidence of revision's work. The assignment makes visible the psychic surgery that produced your portfolio's living texts.

**Key requirements**:
- Claims supported by specific evidence from archived work
- Norman vocabulary applied accurately (affordances, constraints, signifiers, feedback)
- Permission flag analysis: how did visibility/shareability/ownership change?
- Honest assessment of both productive and problematic patterns

See: [[process-archaeology-assignment-course-v101]]

---

### Portfolio Assembly (Ongoing)

**Due**: Week 15 (final submission)

**This week**: Continue assembly. Organize materials, draft connective framing, check completeness. The portfolio is "autonomously distinct pieces" that must function as a whole.

See: [[final-portfolio-assignment-course-v101]]

---

### Presentation Preparation (Upcoming)

**Due**: Week 14

**This week**: Begin preparing presentation materials. What will you share? How will you frame your development as a writer?

## Concept Connections

### Permission Flags Across the Semester

| Week | Permission Development |
|------|----------------------|
| W1-3 | Full write access to fragments; limited read access to scholarly discourse |
| W4-6 | Developing read access (SEAR, BEAM); beginning to share work (peer review) |
| W7-9 | Peer review cycles expand group read access; constraints become visible |
| W10-12 | Write access to scholarly genres develops; portfolio selection begins |
| W13 | Full treatment: tracing how flags changed, who got access when |

### Six-Move Vocabulary Completion

| Move | Introduced | Deepened | Status Week 13 |
|------|------------|----------|----------------|
| Capture | W1 | W2, W4 | Operational |
| Classify | W2 | W6, W8 | Operational |
| Route | W2 | W6 | Operational |
| Distill | W11 | W12 | Operational |
| Connect | W6 | W10, W12 | Operational |
| **Publish** | W13 | — | **Foregrounded (cyclical)** |

### Corpse→Compost→Garden Arc Completion

| Stage | Weeks | Week 13 Status |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| Corpse | W1-5 | Raw material accumulated |
| Compost | W6-11 | Material transformed through care and turning |
| **Garden** | W12-15 | **Flourishing; harvest and continued tending** |

Bernstein's "animation" vocabulary completes the arc: the garden is alive, growing, functioning. But gardens require continued care—publish feeds back into capture, the cycle continues.

---

## Looking Ahead

**Week 14**: Presentations. Students share portfolio work and Process Archaeology insights with the class. No new reading.

**Week 15**: Final portfolio submission. Reflective cover letter. Transfer Proposal. Envelope exercise returns—compare your writing now to Week 1.
