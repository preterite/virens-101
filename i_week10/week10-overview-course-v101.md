## Synthesis

Five weeks ago, Meadows asked where to intervene in a system—and warned that the places where change seems easiest are often the places where it matters least. This week completes that question with two readings that push deeper: how do you see the systems you're trying to intervene in when those systems are designed to be invisible?

Susan Leigh Star, writing from science and technology studies, asks what happens when we try to study infrastructure—the systems we use without noticing: plumbing, electrical grids, file systems, classification schemes. Her work extends Meadows's insight in a crucial direction. Meadows gave you vocabulary for describing systems—stocks, flows, feedback loops, leverage points. Star asks the harder question: what about the systems that are so successful you don't even realize they're there? Infrastructure, she argues, is what works so well it becomes invisible.

Star's central insight is compressed into a single sentence: "The normally invisible quality of working infrastructure becomes visible when it breaks: the server is down, the bridge washes out, there is a power blackout" (382). When systems work, we don't see them. We see through them to whatever task we're trying to accomplish. It's only when they fail—when the Wi-Fi drops, when the file won't open, when the folder structure stops making sense—that infrastructure demands attention. Breakdown reveals structure.

Think about your own folder organization. For weeks you've been filing fragments, naming documents, checking that things land where they belong. When it works, you don't think about it—you think about your writing. But if you couldn't find a fragment you needed, if something got misfiled, if your system collapsed under the weight of accumulating files—then suddenly the infrastructure would become visible. You'd have to think about *how* you organize, not just *what* you've organized.

Star offers a second insight that's equally important: "One person's infrastructure is another's topic, or difficulty" (378). Infrastructure is relational—it depends on who's using it and for what purpose. For the plumber, the water system isn't background; it's the whole job. For the person cooking dinner, the water system is invisible until it fails. The same structure can be infrastructure (invisible, supporting) or topic (visible, examined) depending on perspective and context.

This relational principle applies to your BEAM sources. A source categorized as Background in your portfolio might be Exhibit for someone else. The classification isn't inherent to the source; it's about how the source functions in your project. This is what makes source categorization a thinking task rather than a sorting task. When you map your fragments to portfolio components this week, you're asking a relational question: not "what is this?" but "what does this do here?"

Vannevar Bush, writing in 1945, imagined a machine he called the memex—a device for storing and retrieving personal knowledge through what he called "associative trails." Bush's vision anticipates hyperlinks, personal knowledge management, and the very fragment-based writing you've been practicing. But his deeper insight concerns how minds work: "The human mind does not work that way. It operates by association. With one item in its grasp, it snaps instantly to the next... Thus he builds a trail of his interest through the maze of materials available to him. And his trails do not fade."

Traditional filing systems—alphabetical, numerical, hierarchical—put things in one place. You find them by knowing the path. But association works differently. One idea connects to many others; you move through your knowledge by following connections rather than climbing trees. Bush saw that mechanized systems could preserve these trails, making visible the associative paths that usually exist only ephemerally in thinking.

Your corpus now holds enough material to exhibit this dynamic. A fragment you wrote in Week 2 might connect to something from Week 8. A source categorized as Method might illuminate a claim you made about Background. The content mapping exercise isn't about finding the "right" place for each piece—it's about seeing which pieces illuminate each other, which trails want to form. The trails don't fade. They're in your folders, waiting to be traced.

This is the completion of Difficulty Pair B. Meadows gave you a vocabulary for describing systems—where material accumulates, where it flows, where the feedback loops are, where you might intervene. Star extends that vocabulary into a method: ethnographic attention to the systems that have become so successful they've disappeared. Meadows teaches you to draw the system. Star teaches you to ask the harder question: who built this system, whose values does it encode, and what happens to people who don't fit its categories? Together, they prepare you for one of the central questions of the course: what invisible systems are shaping your writing right now, and what happens when you start to see them?

Bush complements Star from a different angle—not as part of the difficulty pair, but as an independent reading that makes Star's abstractions concrete. Where Star theorizes infrastructure, Bush imagines building it. His memex is infrastructure made visible on purpose: a system designed to preserve the associative trails that usually exist only ephemerally in thinking. If Star explains why you should study infrastructure, Bush shows what it looks like to design it well. What's hardest to see—because it's working, because it's become routine, because it's embedded in how things "just are"—is often where the most important assumptions live.

The BEAM Portfolio Framing assignment due this week asks you to make visible what you've been building. Not just the sources, but how they relate. Not just the categories, but why those categories matter for your inquiry. The framing prose—introduction, transition, conclusion—is where you articulate what the collection means, what research question is emerging, where you might go next. This requires you to step back from the fragments and see the infrastructure you've been constructing.

By Week 11, you'll complete the portfolio with all entries filled. This week is about the architecture: how the pieces fit, what holds them together, what questions they raise. The content mapping exercise is practice for that work—moving fragments around, seeing connections, asking "where does this go and how does it fit?" The answer, as Star would remind us, depends on the context you're building.

## Reading

**This Week**: 

- [[reading-star-ethnography-infrastructure-course-v101|Star, "The Ethnography of Infrastructure"]] (~15 pages)
- [[reading-bush-as-we-may-think-course-v101|Bush, "As We May Think"]] (~12 pages)

**Key Concepts**:

From Star:
- **Infrastructure invisibility**: Systems become visible only when they break
- **Boundary objects**: Things that mean different things to different groups while enabling coordination
- **Relational infrastructure**: "One person's infrastructure is another's topic, or difficulty"
- **Infrastructural inversion**: Deliberately foregrounding what usually stays backstage

From Bush:
- **Memex vision**: Personal knowledge management through associative trails
- **Associative indexing**: Finding by connection rather than hierarchy
- **Trail building**: Creating paths through accumulated material that persist and can be shared
- **Selection as prime action**: The challenge isn't storage but retrieval and connection

**Connection to Activities**: Star's infrastructure invisibility connects to the folder check—when organization works, you don't notice it. Bush's associative trails connect to content mapping—fragments join multiple paths based on context. Both readings inform the BEAM Portfolio Framing by asking students to articulate the architecture they've been building.

**Difficulty Pair B Completion**: 
- Week 5 (Meadows): Vocabulary for describing systems—stocks, flows, feedback loops, leverage points
- Week 10 (Star): Method for studying systems that have become invisible—ethnographic attention to infrastructure
- Theme: Seeing invisible systems—Meadows teaches you to draw the system; Star teaches you to ask who built it and whose values it encodes
- Note: Bush is paired thematically with Star but is not part of the difficulty pair structure. Bush complements Star by imagining infrastructure made visible on purpose (the memex).

**Difficulty Notes**: Star writes in an academic STS register that may feel abstract until connected to concrete examples (folder systems, Wi-Fi, file naming). Bush's 1945 prose is surprisingly accessible but requires historical imagination—students may need help seeing how prescient his vision was. Pairing them makes both more concrete: Star explains why infrastructure matters; Bush shows what making it visible could enable.

### Block Details

#### Block 1: BEAM Portfolio Entry Drafting

**Type**: W

**Duration**: 25 minutes

**Materials**: Student folders (OneDrive), BEAM Portfolio template, source entries from Week 8, Zotero libraries

**Opening** (3 min): "Your BEAM Portfolio Framing is due mid-week. Today is drafting time—working on entries, developing annotations, thinking about how sources connect. You should have at least 2-3 entries from Week 8. Goal today: add or substantially develop at least one more."

Remind students of BEAM categories and the framing requirement:
- Introduction: background on topic, your approach, why these sources
- Entries: annotated sources categorized by BEAM function
- Conclusion: emerging research question, possible directions, significance

**Main Activity** (19 min): Students work on portfolio entries. Options:
- Draft a new entry for a source not yet included
- Develop an existing entry (add analysis, connection to other sources)
- Begin drafting introduction or conclusion framing prose
- Review Zotero library for sources to add

Circulate to check progress. Students should have 4-6 entries by mid-week.

**Closing** (3 min): Quick status check: "How many entries do you have? Which BEAM categories are represented? What's missing?" Transition to revision block.

**Connection**: Supports [[outcome-4-source-integration]]; prepares for [[beam-portfolio-assignment-course-v101]]

---

#### Block 2: Revision + Folder Organization Check

**Type**: R (with tech touch)

**Duration**: 25 minutes (20 min revision + 5 min folder check)

**Materials**: Student folders, fragment inventory, earlier drafts

**Opening** (3 min): "Before we revise, a quick infrastructure check. Star argues that infrastructure becomes visible when it breaks. Let's make yours visible on purpose—before it breaks."

**Folder Organization Check** (5 min): Students open their OneDrive folder and verify:
- [ ] Fragments organized by Movement (M1, M2, M3 subfolders)
- [ ] Naming convention followed (YYYY-MM-DD-topic-slug-status.docx)
- [ ] Dev logs current and findable
- [ ] No orphan files in wrong locations
- [ ] BEAM Portfolio materials accessible

Ask: "Did you find anything misfiled? Anything you couldn't locate? That's Star's point—you just made your infrastructure visible."

**Main Revision Activity** (14 min): Students revise portfolio entries or framing prose based on:
- Gaps identified in folder check (missing sources, uncategorized material)
- Connections noticed while reviewing folder structure
- Preparation for peer review in Block 3

**Closing** (3 min): "What did the folder check reveal? Any surprises?" Brief discussion of infrastructure invisibility in practice.

**Connection**: Enacts Star's infrastructure visibility principle; supports [[outcome-7-process-documentation]]

---

#### Block 3: Eli Review Cycle 5 — BEAM Portfolio Framing

**Type**: P

**Duration**: 25 minutes

**Materials**: Eli Review access, BEAM Portfolio Framing drafts uploaded, Cycle 5 review criteria

**Protocol**: Generous (SPQ) — returning to generous after evaluative cycles in Weeks 7-8

**Opening** (3 min): "Cycle 5 uses the generous protocol again—Sayback, Pointing, Questioning. After two evaluative cycles, we're returning to developmental feedback. Your job is to help your peers see what's working and what could grow."

Remind students of SPQ:
- **Sayback**: What is this draft doing? What do you see?
- **Pointing**: What's working? Where could this go?
- **Questioning**: What do you want to know more about? What's unclear?

**Main Activity** (19 min): Students complete reviews in Eli. Target: 2 reviews minimum.

Review focus for BEAM Portfolio Framing:
- Does the introduction establish context and approach?
- Are BEAM categories used purposefully (not just mechanically)?
- Does the conclusion point toward a research question or synthesis?
- Can you see the "trails" connecting sources?

**Closing** (3 min): "Reviews due by [time]. Reflective One-Pager due after you receive feedback—same structure as before: what feedback did you get, what will you do with it, what did you learn about your own reviewing?"

**Connection**: [[peer-review-cycle5-criteria-course-v101]]; supports [[outcome-3-collaboration]]

---

#### Block 4: Revision Based on Feedback

**Type**: R

**Duration**: 25 minutes

**Materials**: Eli Review feedback received, BEAM Portfolio drafts, revision notes

**Opening** (5 min): "You've received peer feedback on your portfolio framing. Before you dive into changes, take a moment to read through all the feedback. What patterns do you notice? What surprised you?"

Students read feedback silently (3 min), then brief partner share (2 min): "What's one thing your reviewers agreed on?"

**Main Activity** (17 min): Revision work based on feedback. Priorities:
1. Address any confusion about framing (introduction/conclusion)
2. Strengthen BEAM categorization rationale
3. Develop connections between sources that reviewers identified as potential
4. Note questions to address in Week 11 completion

Students may also begin drafting Reflective One-Pager.

**Closing** (3 min): "What's one change you're making based on feedback? What's one question you're still sitting with?" Quick share-out.

**Connection**: Continues [[outcome-1-composing-processes]]; prepares for Week 11 portfolio completion

---

#### Block 5: Continue BEAM Portfolio Entries

**Type**: W

**Duration**: 25 minutes

**Materials**: Student folders, BEAM Portfolio template, Zotero, source materials

**Opening** (3 min): "Portfolio Framing is submitted. Now we continue building entries toward the complete portfolio due Week 11. Today's goal: fill gaps. Which BEAM categories are underrepresented? Which sources haven't you written up yet?"

Quick self-assessment prompt:
- How many Background sources? (target: 1-2)
- How many Exhibit sources? (target: 2-3)
- How many Argument sources? (target: 2-3)
- How many Method sources? (target: 1-2)

**Main Activity** (19 min): Students draft new entries or develop existing ones. Encourage:
- Adding sources from underrepresented categories
- Developing "thin" entries into fuller annotations
- Writing transition sentences between entries
- Noting connections to fragments in corpus

**Closing** (3 min): "Count your entries. You should have 5-7 by now, with all four BEAM categories represented. Week 11 target is 8-10 complete entries plus polished framing."

**Connection**: Builds toward [[beam-portfolio-assignment-course-v101]]; supports [[outcome-5-textual-accumulation]]

---

#### Block 6: Content Mapping Exercise

**Type**: W

**Duration**: 25 minutes

**Materials**: Student folders, fragment inventory, blank paper or digital canvas, BEAM Portfolio draft

**Opening** (5 min): "Bush imagined trails through accumulated material—connections that persist and can be followed. Your corpus now has enough fragments to exhibit this. Today's exercise: map the connections."

Introduce content mapping:
- This is not about finding the "right" place for each piece
- It's about seeing which pieces illuminate each other
- Question to hold: "Where does this go and how does it fit?"—knowing the answer is relational (depends on context)

**Main Activity** (17 min): Students create a visual or textual map of their corpus. Options:
- Draw connections between fragments on paper (cluster diagram)
- Create a list: for each fragment, note 2-3 other fragments it connects to
- Map fragments to BEAM Portfolio sections (which fragments support which sources?)
- Identify "orphan" fragments that don't yet connect to anything

Prompting questions:
- Which fragments speak to each other across weeks?
- Which sources illuminate which fragments?
- Where are the gaps—topics you've written about but haven't sourced, or sources you haven't written toward?
- What research question is emerging from the connections?

**Closing** (3 min): "What trail emerged that you didn't expect? What connection surprised you?" 

This exercise prepares students to write the framing prose (introduction and conclusion) by making visible the architecture of their accumulated work.

**Connection**: Enacts Bush's associative trails; supports [[outcome-2-critical-thinking]]; prepares for Week 11 portfolio completion and Week 12 Documented Inquiry

- Draft due: Mid-week (uploaded to Eli before Block 3)
- Reviews due: End of Block 3 + evening
- Revision window: Block 4 + homework
- Reflective One-Pager due: End of week

**Review Focus**:
- Does the introduction establish context effectively?
- Are BEAM categories used purposefully?
- Does the conclusion point toward synthesis?
- What connections between sources do you see (or want to see)?

**Criteria**: [[peer-review-cycle5-beam-framing-criteria-course-v101]]

**Points**: 40 (25 reviews + 15 revision plan/Reflective One-Pager)

---

## Tech Integration

### This Week: Folder Organization Check (Touch)

**Block 2**: 5-minute infrastructure visibility exercise

**Purpose**: Enact Star's principle—make infrastructure visible before it breaks

**Checklist for Students**:
- [ ] Fragments organized by Movement subfolder
- [ ] Naming convention followed consistently
- [ ] Dev logs current and locatable
- [ ] BEAM Portfolio materials accessible
- [ ] No misfiled or orphan documents

**Connection to Reading**: Star argues infrastructure becomes visible at breakdown. This exercise creates deliberate visibility—examining the system while it's working to see what assumptions it embeds.

### Reminders

- Zotero libraries should be current (sources from Weeks 5-8)
- Eli Review access confirmed for Cycle 5
- OneDrive sync verified before peer review upload

---

## Fragment Production

### This Week's Target

- **Minimum new fragments**: 2-3 (through portfolio entry drafting)
- **Portfolio entries count as fragments**: Yes—each developed annotation is a fragment
- **Content mapping**: May surface fragments needing development
- **Total in-class writing blocks**: 3 (Blocks 1, 5, 6)

### Cumulative Progress

- **Through Week 9**: 25-35 fragments
- **After this week**: 28-38 fragments
- **Semester target**: 40-50 by Week 12

### Note on Fragment Counting

BEAM Portfolio entries count toward fragment totals. A developed annotation (150-400 words with summary, analysis, and connection to project) is a fragment. The portfolio is both a collection instrument and a fragment-production site.

## Connections

### Backward Links

- **Week 9**: [[week09-overview-course-v101]] — Conferences provided individual direction; students return with clearer project focus
- **Week 8**: [[week08-overview-course-v101]] — BEAM source entries began; mill/store metaphor established
- **Week 5**: [[week05-overview-course-v101]] — **Difficulty Pair B began** with Meadows; leverage points; returns here with Star

### Forward Links

- **Week 11**: [[week11-overview-course-v101]] — BEAM Portfolio complete; maintenance labor (Ribes [[@ribes2013datb]] & Jackson)
- **Week 12**: [[week12-overview-course-v101]] — Documented Inquiry builds from portfolio; M3→M4 transition

### Difficulty Pair B Arc

| Week | Reading | Focus |
|------|---------|-------|
| 5 | Meadows | Systems vocabulary—stocks, flows, feedback loops, leverage points |
| 10 | Star | Invisible systems—ethnographic attention to infrastructure |

**Theme**: Seeing invisible systems—Meadows teaches you to draw the system; Star teaches you to ask who built it and whose values it encodes

**Note**: Bush ("As We May Think") is paired thematically with Star but is not part of the difficulty pair structure. Bush complements Star by imagining infrastructure made visible on purpose.

## Instructor Notes

### Facilitation Tips

**On Difficulty Pair B completion**: Make the Meadows connection explicit. Students may not remember Week 5 details, but the conceptual arc (systems vocabulary → infrastructure ethnography) is the point. Ask: "What did Meadows say about seeing systems? How does Star extend that idea into the systems you don't even notice?"

**On the folder check**: This should feel like a practical exercise, not a gotcha. The goal is experiencing Star's insight firsthand—infrastructure becomes visible when examined. If students find misfiled items, that's pedagogically useful, not a failure.

**On content mapping**: Some students will want a "right answer" for where fragments belong. Reinforce the relational principle: it depends on context. The same fragment might serve multiple purposes. That's Bush's point about trails.

**On BEAM Portfolio Framing**: The framing prose (introduction and conclusion) is where students articulate their emerging project. Some will resist the "conclusion" requirement because they don't feel ready. Remind them: tentative is fine. "Here's what seems to be emerging" is a valid conclusion.

### Flexibility Points

- **Content mapping format**: Students can do this on paper, digitally, as a list, as a cluster diagram—whatever helps them see connections
- **Entry count**: 5-7 entries by end of week is target; 4 is acceptable if entries are well-developed
- **Reflective One-Pager timing**: Can extend to early Week 11 if needed

### What's Locked

- **Peer review Cycle 5**: Must happen this week (Generous/SPQ protocol)
- **BEAM Portfolio Framing due mid-week**: Sets up revision cycle
- **Difficulty Pair B completion**: Star reading is required and anchors the pair; Bush complements Star thematically but is not part of the pair structure

### Evidence to Collect

- Do students connect Star's infrastructure concept to their own folder systems?
- Does content mapping reveal connections students hadn't seen?
- Are BEAM categories being used purposefully (not just mechanically)?
- Does the Pair B completion land—do students see the Meadows connection?

### Common Questions/Confusions

**"What's the difference between Portfolio Framing and complete Portfolio?"**
- Framing = introduction + conclusion + partial entries (architecture visible)
- Complete = all entries filled + polished framing (Week 11)

**"How many sources do I need?"**
- Target: 8-10 entries total by Week 11
- This week: 5-7 entries with all four BEAM categories represented

**"Can a source be in multiple BEAM categories?"**
- Generally no—categorization is about function *in your project*
- But you can note that a source *could* serve other functions

**"What if my research question is still vague?"**
- That's fine. The conclusion asks for "emerging" question, "possible" directions
- The content mapping exercise is designed to help questions emerge from connections
