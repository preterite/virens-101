## Policy Statement

### Policy Text

Late work is accepted with graduated penalties to balance flexibility for students with the need to maintain peer review timelines and feedback cycles. **Submitting work late is better than not submitting it**, but late submissions disrupt the collaborative learning environment this course depends on.

**Graduated Penalties:**
- **1-2 days late**: -20% on that assignment
- **3-7 days late**: -30% on that assignment  
- **8+ days late**: -50% on that assignment

**Portfolio Exception**: The final portfolio is exempt from late penalties—it's due at the end of the semester and cannot be submitted late except through formal university extension processes.

**Justification**: [[late-work-policy-reasons-v101#Policy Rationale|Why this policy?]]

## How Late Penalties Work

### Assignment-Specific Penalties

**Fragments**:
- Target: 3-4 fragments per week
- Late penalty applies to individual fragments submitted past weekly deadline
- **Example**: Friday deadline; submit Monday = -20%, submit next Friday = -30%

**Eli Review submissions**:
- Deadlines tied to peer review cycles
- Late submission means your peers have nothing to review
- **Example**: Review due Wednesday; submit Thursday = -20%, submit following Monday = -30%

**Reflective one-pagers**:
- Four assigned across semester (Weeks 6, 9, 12, 14)
- Late penalty applies to each one-pager individually
- **Example**: Due Friday; submit Sunday = -20%

**Process documentation** (dev logs, system maps):
- Periodic check-ins (Weeks 4, 8, 12)
- Late penalty applies if not ready for check-in
- **Example**: Week 8 check-in on Wednesday; ready by Friday = -20%

**What's exempt**:
- **Daily quizzes**: Not accepted late (but lowest 10 dropped covers occasional absences)
- **Portfolio**: Due end of semester, no late penalties (extensions via formal university processes only)

**Justification**: [[late-work-policy-reasons-v101#Assignment Types|Why different treatment?]]

## Calculating Penalties

### How the Math Works

Late penalties are calculated based on the assignment's **maximum possible points**, then applied to your earned score.

**Example 1: Fragment (10 points possible)**
- You submit quality work worth 9/10 points
- But it's 3 days late (30% penalty)
- **Calculation**: 9 points - (10 × 0.30) = 9 - 3 = **6 points**

**Example 2: Eli Review submission (40 points possible)**
- Your review feedback earns 38/40 points
- But it's 1 day late (20% penalty)
- **Calculation**: 38 points - (40 × 0.20) = 38 - 8 = **30 points**

**Why this method?**
The penalty is based on the assignment's weight, not your earned score. This means:
- High-quality late work still receives partial credit
- But the penalty is substantial enough to incentivize timeliness
- Students can recover by completing work even if late

**Justification**: [[late-work-policy-reasons-v101#Penalty Calculation|Why this formula?]]

## Deadlines and Grace Periods

### Standard Deadlines

**Fragments**:
- Weekly deadlines (typically Friday end-of-day)
- Allows you to write during the week, submit by Friday
- Grace period: Until 11:59 PM Friday (technically Saturday morning)

**Eli Review cycles**:
- **Write** deadline: Submit draft for peer review (typically Monday)
- **Review** deadline: Complete peer feedback (typically Wednesday)
- **Revise** deadline: Submit revision (typically Friday)
- Late penalties apply separately to each phase

**Reflective one-pagers**:
- Assigned in Weeks 6, 9, 12, 14
- Due Friday of assigned week
- Grace period: Until 11:59 PM Friday

**Process documentation**:
- Dev logs: Checked at Weeks 4, 8, 12 (Wednesday in class)
- System maps: Due Weeks 8 and 15 (with midterm check and portfolio)
- Grace period: Until Friday same week for check-ins

### Technical Difficulties Grace Period

**Canvas/tech issues**:
- If Canvas is down at deadline, you have until system is restored + 2 hours
- Must email instructor immediately when you notice issue
- Screenshot error message if possible

**File corruption**:
- Keep backup copies (OneDrive version history helps)
- If file won't upload, email it directly to instructor by deadline
- No penalty if good-faith effort to submit on time

**Justification**: [[late-work-policy-reasons-v101#Grace Periods|Why these buffers?]]

## Implementation

### Communication

**Syllabus week**: Policy explained in detail, examples provided

**When assignments are posted**: Deadline clearly stated on Canvas, in class, and in assignment sheet

**If you need extension**: Contact instructor **before** deadline when possible (see Exceptions & Flexibility below)

**After late submission**: Canvas gradebook shows penalty applied, with comment explaining calculation

### Tracking Deadlines

**Your responsibility**:
- Check Canvas calendar for all deadlines
- Set personal reminders 24-48 hours before deadlines
- Plan ahead for busy weeks (exams in other classes, work conflicts)

**Instructor support**:
- Canvas announcement 24 hours before major deadlines
- In-class reminders for Eli Review cycle deadlines
- Syllabus calendar shows all major deadlines at semester start

### Monitoring Your Grade

**Canvas gradebook**:
- Shows penalties applied to late work
- Comments explain calculation
- Updated within 1 week of submission

**If penalty seems incorrect**:
- Check submission timestamp in Canvas
- Email instructor with specific concern
- Mistakes will be corrected

**Justification**: [[late-work-policy-reasons-v101#Implementation Approach|How this works in practice]]

## Exceptions & Flexibility

### When Extensions Are Available

**Documented emergencies**:
- Serious illness (yours or immediate family)
- Family emergency or crisis
- Mandatory court appearance
- University-excused absences (athletics, official travel)

**Process for requesting extension**:
1. **Contact instructor ASAP** (before deadline when possible)
2. **Explain situation** (brief email sufficient initially)
3. **Provide documentation** if absence is 3+ days
4. **Propose new deadline** (typically 3-5 days from original)

**What constitutes documentation**:
- Doctor's note (even from student health center)
- Dean of Students emergency notification
- Athletic travel letter
- Court summons or other official document

### When Extensions Are Not Available

**Poor planning**:
- "I forgot" or "I didn't check Canvas" = standard late penalties apply
- Multiple assignments due same week is not emergency (plan ahead)

**Competing deadlines**:
- Other classes' deadlines don't excuse late work here
- Midterms/finals in other courses = plan ahead, use time management

**Technology issues (minor)**:
- "My printer broke" = submit digitally
- "I ran out of time to proofread" = submit draft, revise later

**Work or family obligations (routine)**:
- Regular work schedule = plan around it
- Childcare responsibilities = build in buffer time
- These are real challenges but not emergencies requiring extensions

**But**:
- If work/family obligations become overwhelming, talk to instructor
- We can discuss strategies (lighter weeks, spreading work differently)
- Student support resources available (counseling, financial aid, dean of students)

### Compassionate Consideration

**If you're struggling**:
- Reach out before you're completely underwater
- Week 4-6 is better than Week 12-14
- We can create plan together (possibly reduced load, focus on portfolio)

**Withdrawal option**:
- If circumstances make completion impossible
- Deadline typically Week 10 (check academic calendar)
- Discuss with instructor and academic advisor

**Justification**: [[late-work-policy-reasons-v101#Equity Considerations|Supporting all students]]

## Impact on Your Grade

### Scenario Analysis

Understanding how late penalties affect your final grade:

**Scenario 1: Occasional late work**
- 3 fragments late by 1-2 days across semester (-20% each)
- 1 Eli Review late by 3 days (-30%)
- **Impact**: ~1-2% reduction in final grade (from 87% to 85-86%)

**Scenario 2: Chronic lateness**
- 15 fragments late by 3-7 days (-30% each)
- 3 Eli Reviews late by 1-2 days (-20% each)
- **Impact**: ~7-10% reduction in final grade (from 85% to 75-78%)

**Scenario 3: Extreme case**
- 20+ fragments late by 8+ days (-50% each)
- All Eli Reviews late significantly
- **Impact**: ~15-20% reduction (from 85% to 65-70%)

**Key insight**: A few late submissions won't destroy your grade, but chronic lateness significantly impacts formative work score (50% of final grade).

### Recovery Strategies

**If you fall behind**:
1. **Prioritize upcoming deadlines** (don't keep falling further behind)
2. **Submit late work** (partial credit better than zero)
3. **Focus on portfolio quality** (can recover through strong final work)
4. **Use office hours** to create catch-up plan

**Built-in forgiveness**:
- Dropped quizzes (10 lowest) = ~1.5 weeks of absences covered
- Fragment accumulation assessed across semester (can catch up in lighter weeks)
- Portfolio exempt from penalties (final work not affected by earlier struggles)

**Justification**: [[late-work-policy-reasons-v101#Grade Impact|Why penalties are meaningful but not devastating]]

## Student Support

### Resources Provided

**Time management support**:
- Week 2 workshop: Planning your semester
- Syllabus calendar tool (downloadable .ics file)
- Office hours for strategy discussions

**Emergency resources**:
- Dean of Students emergency assistance
- Student health center (physical and mental health)
- Financial aid emergency grants (if circumstances are financial)
- Campus food bank (if stress is food-security related)

### Common Questions

**Q**: "What if I know in advance I'll be late?"
**A**: Contact me before the deadline. We may be able to arrange extension if you have legitimate conflict. Proactive communication helps.

**Q**: "Can I submit everything at the end of the semester?"
**A**: No. Late work accepted, but submitting 40 fragments in Week 15 means no peer feedback cycles, no revision opportunities. You'd receive completion credit with penalties but miss the learning process.

**Q**: "What if I'm late because I wanted to make my work better?"
**A**: Submit on time, then revise. The revision cycle is built into the course (Eli Review → reflective one-pagers → portfolio). Perfectionism that prevents submission is counterproductive.

**Q**: "I submitted to wrong Canvas assignment. Does that count as late?"
**A**: No, if timestamp shows on-time submission to Canvas. Just resubmit to correct assignment and email me. Technical errors are different from missing deadlines.

**Q**: "What if Canvas says I submitted late but I know I submitted on time?"
**A**: Email me with concern. Canvas timestamps are usually reliable, but technical glitches happen. I'll investigate and correct if system error occurred.
