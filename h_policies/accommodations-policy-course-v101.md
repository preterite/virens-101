## Policy Statement

### University Accommodation Policy

Reasonable accommodations are available for students with documented disabilities or chronic medical conditions. This course follows Washington State University policies for providing equal access to all students.

**All accommodations must be approved through the Access Center (Disability Resource Services).** I cannot provide accommodations without official documentation from DRS, but I will work with you to implement approved accommodations in ways that support your success in this course.

**Justification**: [[accommodations-policy-reasons-v101#Policy Rationale|University compliance and course philosophy]]

## How to Request Accommodations

### If You Already Have Accommodations

**Step 1**: Email me your DRS accommodation letter **within the first two weeks of the semester**

**Step 2**: Schedule a meeting (office hours or separate appointment) to discuss implementation
- We'll talk through how accommodations work in this specific course
- I'll answer questions about logistics (extended time, alternative formats, etc.)
- You'll have opportunity to ask about anything that's unclear

**Step 3**: We'll create an implementation plan together
- Some accommodations are straightforward (extended time on in-class writing)
- Others require coordination (modified peer review schedules, alternative assessment formats)
- Better to plan ahead than to troubleshoot mid-semester

### If You Need to Request New Accommodations

**Contact the Access Center:**
- **Location**: Washington Building 217
- **Phone**: 509-335-3417
- **Email**: Access.Center@wsu.edu
- **Website**: https://accesscenter.wsu.edu

**Process:**
1. Schedule appointment with Access Advisor
2. Provide documentation of your disability/condition
3. Discuss what accommodations you need
4. Access Center issues accommodation letter
5. You share letter with your instructors (including me)

**Timeline**: Allow 2-3 weeks for DRS to process new accommodation requests. Start this process as early as possible.

## Common Accommodations in This Course

### How Accommodations Typically Work

Different accommodations have different implementations in this course:

**Extended time on in-class writing:**
- You'll have extended time for generative writing activities
- We'll coordinate logistics (staying after class, using separate room, etc.)
- Daily quizzes: You can complete these with extended time if needed

**Note-taking support:**
- DRS can arrange peer note-takers
- Or you may record class sessions (with permission)
- Digital handouts always available on Canvas

**Alternative assessment formats:**
- Portfolio can be submitted in alternative formats if approved by DRS
- We'll discuss options during our accommodation implementation meeting

**Modified attendance requirements:**
- Some conditions may qualify for modified attendance expectations
- Your DRS letter will specify if this applies to you
- We'll discuss how this interacts with the course's 10-quiz grace period

**Assistive technology:**
- You may use any DRS-approved assistive technology
- Screen readers, speech-to-text software, alternative keyboards all welcome
- Let me know if course materials aren't accessible with your technology

**Preferential seating:**
- Let me know your seating needs (front of room, near door, specific table, etc.)
- I'll make sure your preferred spot is available

**Testing accommodations:**
- This course has minimal traditional testing (daily quizzes only)
- Accommodations apply to quizzes if needed
- Portfolio has no time limit, so extended time not typically necessary

## Discussing Your Needs

### Our Accommodation Implementation Meeting

**When we meet to discuss your accommodations, come prepared to discuss:**

1. **How your disability affects your participation in this course specifically**
   - What aspects of the course (peer review, in-class writing, reading assignments) might be challenging?
   - What strategies have worked for you in other courses?

2. **Logistics and preferences**
   - Extended time: Do you prefer staying after class or coming to separate session?
   - Alternative formats: Do you prefer audio, digital text, large print, etc.?
   - Peer review: Any concerns about collaborative work with your disability?

3. **Questions about course structure**
   - Anything unclear about how accommodations work with peer review, fragments, portfolio?
   - Concerns about specific assignments or activities?

**This conversation is confidential.** I won't share your disability information with anyone (including other students, TAs, or colleagues) unless you explicitly give permission.

**You are not required to disclose your specific disability.** I only need to know (a) what your approved accommodations are, and (b) how to implement them in this course.

**Justification**: [[accommodations-policy-reasons-v101#Confidentiality and Disclosure|Privacy protections]]

## Mid-Semester Accommodation Requests

### If You Discover You Need Accommodations During the Semester

**It's not too late to request accommodations mid-semester.**

**What to do:**
1. Contact Access Center immediately to start process
2. Email me to let me know you're seeking accommodations
3. Once you receive accommodation letter, we'll implement going forward

**Accommodations are not retroactive:**
- Accommodations apply from the date of approval forward
- I cannot change grades on past work or excuse past absences based on newly approved accommodations
- But we can ensure all future work is accessible

**If you're struggling:** Even if you don't think you qualify for formal accommodations, come talk to me. We can discuss strategies, campus resources, and whether DRS consultation might help.

**Justification**: [[accommodations-policy-reasons-v101#Timing and Retroactivity|Why encourage early request]]

---

## Temporary Accommodations

### Short-Term Injuries or Illnesses

**Temporary conditions** (broken arm, concussion, surgery recovery) may also qualify for accommodations.

**Process:**
1. Contact Access Center to discuss temporary accommodations
2. Provide medical documentation
3. DRS issues temporary accommodation letter (with end date)
4. Share letter with me and we'll implement

**Examples of temporary accommodations:**
- Extended time while recovering from concussion
- Note-taker while arm is in cast
- Attendance flexibility during chemotherapy

**Alternative for very short-term issues:**
Sometimes informal arrangements are more practical than formal DRS process:
- You break your hand Week 14, only 2 weeks left in semester → We can arrange for you to dictate rather than type without formal DRS process
- You have surgery and miss one week → Use your quiz grace period; we'll discuss makeup work individually

**When to use DRS vs. informal arrangement:** If your condition affects you for more than 2 weeks or requires significant course modifications, go through DRS. For very brief, minor issues, email me and we'll work it out.

**Justification**: [[accommodations-policy-reasons-v101#Temporary vs Permanent|Flexibility for short-term needs]]

## Course Design and Universal Access

### How This Course Supports Accessibility

Even without formal accommodations, this course is designed with accessibility in mind:

**Flexible formats:**
- Fragments can be handwritten (index cards) or digital (OneDrive/Word)
- Process documentation (workflow logs) can be text, audio, or video
- Portfolio can include multimodal elements

**Built-in forgiveness:**
- 10 dropped quizzes accommodate illness, medical appointments, mental health days
- Late work accepted with graduated penalties (not outright rejection)
- Portfolio structure allows recovery from weaker early work

**Clear expectations:**
- All assignment sheets available on Canvas in advance
- Rubrics provided before assignments due
- Sample work and models provided

**Multiple feedback sources:**
- Peer review (multiple perspectives)
- Instructor feedback (selective but detailed)
- Self-assessment (reflective one-pagers)

**Process-oriented assessment:**
- Portfolio grading values growth over perfection
- Process documentation counts as evidence of learning
- Revision is built into structure, not penalized

**Justification**: [[accommodations-policy-reasons-v101#Universal Design|Design philosophy]]

## Mental Health Support

### Mental Health Is Part of Wellness

**Mental health conditions** (depression, anxiety, PTSD, ADHD, etc.) can qualify for accommodations just like physical disabilities.

**Common mental health accommodations:**
- Attendance flexibility
- Extended time on assignments (to manage anxiety)
- Reduced course load
- Quiet testing environment
- Permission to leave class if needed

**If you're struggling with mental health:**

**Access Center** can coordinate accommodations: Access.Center@wsu.edu

**Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS)** provides counseling:
- Website: https://caps.wsu.edu
- Phone: 509-335-2159
- Walk-in crisis services available

**24/7 Crisis Support:**
- National: 988 (Suicide and Crisis Lifeline)
- Local: CAPS After-Hours Crisis Line: 509-335-2159

**You don't need a formal diagnosis to seek help.** If you're struggling, reach out to CAPS even if you're not sure you "qualify."

**Justification**: [[accommodations-policy-reasons-v101#Mental Health Parity|Why mental health matters]]

## Common Questions

**Q: Will my accommodations affect my grade or how you evaluate my work?**
**A:** No. Accommodations provide equal access to learning, not unfair advantage. Your work is evaluated on the same criteria as all students—accommodations just change how you demonstrate that learning.

**Q: Do I have to tell you what my disability is?**
**A:** No. You only need to share your DRS accommodation letter. You're welcome to share more if you want me to understand your situation better, but it's not required.

**Q: What if my accommodation letter says I can have extended time, but I don't always need it?**
**A:** That's fine. Accommodations are available when you need them; you're not required to use them every time.

**Q: Can I get accommodations for just one assignment that's particularly challenging for me?**
**A:** Accommodations typically apply to the course as a whole, not individual assignments. But if you're struggling with something specific, come talk to me—we might be able to find solutions even without formal accommodations.

**Q: What if I'm not sure whether I need accommodations?**
**A:** Schedule a consultation with Access Center. They can help you determine whether accommodations would be beneficial and what the process looks like.
