## Policy Statement

### Academic Writing as Collaboration Across Time

Academic writing builds upon, responds to, and explicitly acknowledges the work of others. This class will help you learn how to do that while avoiding plagiarism. The Council of Writing Program Administrators (CWPA) states that "In an instructional setting, plagiarism occurs when a writer deliberately uses someone else's language, ideas, or other original material without acknowledging its source."

As a WSU student, you are bound by the WSU Academic Integrity Policy and Standards of Conduct for Students and are responsible for being aware of and abiding by them. This policy explains how those university-level expectations apply in this specific course, which values both individual work and collaborative learning.

**Justification**: [[ai-academic-integrity-reasons-v101#Policy Rationale|Why this framing?]]

## What Counts as Your Work

### Original Writing

Your writing is "original" when:
- **The ideas are yours**: You developed them through reading, thinking, discussing, and writing
- **The words are yours**: Even when discussing others' ideas, you express them in your own language
- **The process is yours**: You can document how you arrived at this writing through your workflow logs and dev logs

Originality doesn't mean you thought of everything independently—it means you can trace and acknowledge the sources (readings, conversations, generative AI, peer feedback) that helped shape your thinking.

### Acknowledged Collaboration

This course values collaboration. You may collaborate with others and acknowledge it in any of these ways:

**Citations and quotations** (cross-time collaboration):
- When you use others' ideas or words, cite them according to MLA format
- Citations connect you to a larger conversation and show respect for others' intellectual labor
- See our course guide on MLA citation for details

**Peer feedback** (acknowledged collaboration):
- "My classmate Jenny's extensive comments on my draft helped me develop this section"
- "The peer review cycle in Week 5 identified weaknesses in my evidence that I've addressed here"

**Generative AI assistance** (tool-mediated collaboration):
- Treat generative AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, Grammarly AI, etc.) as somebody else's work, because they are
- If you received AI assistance or used words that weren't yours, say so—offer an acknowledgment in the document you turn in
- See the "Generative AI Use" section below for specific guidelines

**Instructor or tutor help**:
- "I worked with the Writing Center tutor Maria to clarify my thesis"
- "Professor Edwards suggested I reorganize my evidence in this section"

Real-world writing involves extensive collaboration. This course teaches you to acknowledge that collaboration transparently.

**Justification**: [[ai-academic-integrity-reasons-v101#Collaboration Philosophy|Why allow collaboration?]]

## Generative AI Use: Disclose and Reflect

### Acceptable AI Use

You may use generative AI tools (large language models like ChatGPT, Claude, or AI writing assistants like Grammarly) in this course **if you disclose and reflect on that use**.

**"Disclose and reflect" means:**

1. **Disclose what tool you used and how**: 
   - "I used ChatGPT to generate three possible thesis statements, then selected and revised one"
   - "I used Grammarly's AI suggestions to reorganize this paragraph"
   - "Claude helped me brainstorm counterarguments I hadn't considered"

2. **Reflect on what the tool contributed**:
   - What did the AI suggest that you wouldn't have thought of yourself?
   - What did you accept, reject, or modify from the AI's output?
   - How did using the tool change your writing process?

**Where to disclose**:
- Include a brief note in your fragment or draft itself, OR
- Document it in your workflow log for that writing session

**If you're not sure about how or whether to document assistance, ask me, and I'll help.**

### Why This Approach?

Generative AI tools are increasingly part of professional writing environments. Learning to use them responsibly—understanding both their capabilities and limitations—is a valuable skill. But using AI without understanding how it works or without being able to explain what you learned from it disrupts the generative process this course is built on.

**Good AI use** (human sets constraints, AI iterates, human evaluates):
- "I need to find three sources about X that argue Y—help me search and organize what I find"
- "I have 10 fragments about related topics—help me see which ones connect"
- "Format my citations in MLA style"

**Poor AI use** (AI replaces human thinking):
- "Write my essay about X"
- "Summarize these sources for me"
- "Decide which evidence is strongest"

The goal is not to ban AI but to ensure you're learning to write, not learning to prompt.

## What Counts as Plagiarism

### Two Types, Two Responses

This course distinguishes between two different kinds of plagiarism because they represent different failures:

#### Type 1: Full-Text Submission (Severe)

**What it is:** Submitting a complete text—or substantial portions of a text—that you did not write as if it were your own work.

**Examples:**
- Purchasing or downloading an essay and submitting it
- Having someone else write your assignment for you
- Copying and pasting large sections from sources without attribution
- Asking an AI to generate a complete draft and submitting it without substantial revision or disclosure

**Why it's severe:** This disrupts the entire generative process this course is built on. It prevents you from developing your ideas through writing, receiving feedback on your thinking, and revising based on that feedback. It also makes it impossible for me to help you improve as a writer.

**Consequence:** Students who commit this type of plagiarism will be reported to the Assistant Director of Composition and the Office of the Dean of Students and will fail the assignment. Depending on severity and whether it's a repeated offense, students may fail the course.

#### Type 2: Unacknowledged Quotation/Citation Errors (Teachable)

**What it is:** Misunderstanding how to properly integrate, attribute, or cite sources.

**Examples:**
- Not understanding the distinction between paraphrasing, summarizing, and quoting
- Paraphrasing too closely to the original source wording
- Forgetting to cite a source you intended to cite
- Citing the source but not using quotation marks for exact language
- Misunderstanding MLA citation format

**Why it's different:** These represent skills you're still learning. They indicate you need more practice with source integration and citation conventions, not that you're trying to deceive me.

**Consequence:** I will work with you to understand and correct citation errors. These errors will affect your grade on the specific assignment (because proper citation is one of our course outcomes), but they are treated as learning opportunities, not academic misconduct.

If you're unsure whether your citation practice is acceptable, **ask before submitting**. I'm always available to review your source integration and citation.

**Justification**: [[ai-academic-integrity-reasons-v101#Two-Tiered Response|Why distinguish these?]]

## What This Course Will NOT Use

**This course will not use Turnitin or other automated plagiarism detection services.**

**Why not:** These services operate on a "guilty until proven innocent" assumption, treating all students as potential plagiarists. They also raise serious concerns about student privacy, intellectual property rights, and the reduction of complex writing situations to algorithmic matching.

The Conference on College Composition and Communication (CCCC), the major national organization for writing teachers, states: "CCCC does not endorse the use of plagiarism detection services" because they "potentially undermine students' agency as writers, treat all students as always already plagiarists, create a hostile learning environment, shift the responsibility of identifying and interpreting source misuse from teachers to technology, and compel students to agree to licensing agreements that threaten their privacy and rights to their own intellectual property."

Instead, this course:
- Teaches citation and source integration skills explicitly
- Provides multiple opportunities to practice those skills with feedback
- Relies on instructor knowledge of your writing development over the semester
- Emphasizes process documentation that makes your writing development visible

**Justification**: [[ai-academic-integrity-reasons-v101#No Automated Detection|Pedagogical and ethical rationale]]

---

## Portfolio and Collaboration

Your final portfolio can and should include evidence of collaboration:

**Citing peer feedback:**
- "Based on the peer review cycle in Week 7, I revised my introduction to foreground the counterargument before presenting my own position"

**Acknowledging collaborative development:**
- "My understanding of this concept developed through discussion with classmates in the Week 4 generative writing session"

**Showing revision based on instructor feedback:**
- "Professor Edwards' comment that my evidence didn't support my claim led me to revise this section"

**Documenting cross-time collaboration with sources:**
- Your works cited page shows which authors' ideas informed your thinking
- Your in-text citations show where specific claims or evidence came from

Real-world writing work involves extensive collaboration—sometimes with people in the same room, sometimes with people across time (through their published work), sometimes with tools. What matters is acknowledging that collaboration transparently so readers can evaluate your work fairly and trace the ideas back to their sources.

**Justification**: [[ai-academic-integrity-reasons-v101#Portfolio Collaboration|Why allow collaborative evidence?]]

## Implementation

### Communication

**Week 1:** This policy introduced in syllabus and discussed in class, with opportunity for questions

**Ongoing:** 
- Every assignment prompt reminds you to cite sources and acknowledge assistance
- Citation workshops in Weeks 3, 7, and 11
- I'm available in office hours to review your source integration and citation before submission

### If You're Unsure

**Before submitting:** If you're uncertain whether your citation, collaboration acknowledgment, or AI use documentation is adequate, **ask me**. I will help you determine how to properly acknowledge sources and assistance.

**Better to ask and be sure than to submit and worry.**

### If I Suspect Plagiarism

If I encounter writing that appears to be plagiarized:

1. **I will contact you** to discuss the situation before making any reports
2. **We will review the work together** and discuss my concerns
3. **You will have opportunity to explain** your writing process and provide evidence (workflow logs, earlier drafts, etc.)
4. **I will determine whether** this is Type 1 (severe: deliberate full-text submission) or Type 2 (teachable: citation errors)
5. **Appropriate action will be taken** based on that determination

I am required to report Type 1 plagiarism to the Assistant Director of Composition and the Office of the Dean of Students per university policy.

**Justification**: [[ai-academic-integrity-reasons-v101#Implementation Approach|Philosophy]]

### Common Questions

**Q: Can I use AI grammar checkers like Grammarly?**
**A:** Yes, but distinguish between Grammarly's basic grammar/spelling checks (which don't need disclosure) and Grammarly's AI-powered rewriting suggestions (which do need disclosure if you use them).

**Q: If I talk through my ideas with a friend and they suggest an argument I hadn't thought of, do I need to cite them?**
**A:** A simple acknowledgment is appropriate: "My understanding of this concept developed through conversation with [friend's name]." You don't need a formal citation, but acknowledging intellectual debts is good practice.

**Q: What if I accidentally forget to cite something?**
**A:** Contact me as soon as you realize the error. If it's before I've graded the work, we can discuss how to correct it. If it's after, we'll discuss whether it's a minor citation error (Type 2) that can be addressed through revision or a more serious issue.

**Q: Can I reuse writing I did for another class?**
**A:** Not without explicit permission from me AND from the instructor of the other course. Self-plagiarism (reusing your own work without acknowledgment) is a form of academic misconduct. However, if you want to develop an idea from another course further in this course, talk to me—we can often find ways to make that work ethically.

**Q: How much AI help is too much?**
**A:** If the AI is doing the thinking for you rather than helping you think, that's too much. A good test: Can you explain your writing process and decision-making without saying "the AI told me to"? If not, you're relying on AI too heavily.
