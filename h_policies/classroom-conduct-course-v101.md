## Policy Statement

### Creating a Productive Learning Environment

This course depends on **collaborative learning, peer feedback, and respectful engagement**. We'll be sharing writing, offering critique, and working together throughout the semester. For that to work, we need a classroom environment where everyone feels respected, heard, and safe to take intellectual risks.

These expectations apply to all class interactions: in-person discussions, peer review, online forums, and collaborative activities.

**Justification**: [[classroom-conduct-reasons-v101#Policy Rationale|Why these expectations matter]]

---

## Respectful Engagement

### Basic Expectations

**Respect for persons:**
- Treat all classmates and the instructor with dignity
- Listen when others are speaking
- Disagree with ideas, not people
- Assume good faith in others' contributions

**Respect for diverse identities:**
- Honor each person's race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, gender, sexuality, ability, and veteran status
- Use the names and pronouns people use for themselves
- Avoid stereotypes or assumptions about others based on identity

**Respect for the learning process:**
- Arrive on time and stay for full class
- Come prepared (readings completed, materials ready)
- Engage actively in activities and discussions
- Help create environment where others can learn

**Justification**: [[classroom-conduct-reasons-v101#Respectful Engagement|Why these standards]]

---

## Collaborative Work

### Peer Review and Group Work

This course involves substantial collaborative learning:
- Peer review of drafts (6 cycles)
- Small group discussions and activities
- Shared generative writing exercises
- In-class workshops

**Expectations for collaboration:**

**Be helpful:**
- Give thoughtful, constructive feedback (not just "good job")
- Ask clarifying questions when you don't understand
- Offer suggestions, not just criticism

**Be reliable:**
- Submit work on time so peers have material to review
- Complete your share of group work
- Show up for collaborative activities

**Be generous:**
- Share your ideas and processes with others
- Learn from your peers' approaches
- Recognize that helping others also helps you learn

**Handle conflict productively:**
- If peer feedback feels unhelpful or harsh, talk to me
- If group dynamics aren't working, address it early
- Focus on moving forward, not assigning blame

**Justification**: [[classroom-conduct-reasons-v101#Collaborative Learning|Why collaboration matters]]

---

## Classroom Participation

### Contributing to Discussion

**In-class discussions:**
- Contribute your thoughts, but don't dominate
- Build on others' ideas
- Ask questions when confused
- Connect discussion to readings and your own writing

**Balance participation:**
- If you tend to speak a lot, make space for others
- If you tend to stay quiet, challenge yourself to contribute
- Value quality over quantity (one thoughtful comment > five superficial ones)

**Online discussions (if applicable):**
- Post substantively, not just "I agree"
- Respond to at least two peers' posts
- Cite specific passages from readings
- Extend conversation rather than repeating what's been said

**Justification**: [[classroom-conduct-reasons-v101#Participation Philosophy|Why participation matters]]

---

## Disruptive Behavior

### What Counts as Disruptive

**Behaviors that interfere with learning:**
- Chronic lateness or early departure
- Side conversations during instruction or peer presentations
- Technology use unrelated to class (social media, gaming, shopping)
- Sleeping in class
- Hostile, dismissive, or disrespectful comments toward others

**First response:**
I'll address minor issues informally (quiet word, email reminder).

**Persistent issues:**
- Conversation in office hours to understand what's happening
- May result in lower participation grade
- Repeated disruption may be referred to Dean of Students

**Justification**: [[classroom-conduct-reasons-v101#Managing Disruption|Graduated response approach]]

## Academic Freedom and Difficult Topics

### Navigating Challenging Discussions

**This course may address difficult topics:**
- Writing involves exploring ideas, including controversial or uncomfortable ones
- Peer review may involve critiquing each other's positions
- Readings may present perspectives you disagree with

**Guidelines for productive disagreement:**

**Critique ideas, not people:**
- "I disagree with this argument because..." ✓
- "You're wrong and here's why..." ✗

**Assume complexity:**
- Most issues have multiple valid perspectives
- Acknowledge what's persuasive in arguments you ultimately reject
- Avoid absolutist language ("always," "never," "obviously")

**Stay grounded in evidence:**
- Support your claims with reasoning and evidence
- Distinguish between opinion and fact
- Acknowledge when you're uncertain or still thinking through an issue

**Recognize impact:**
- Some topics affect people personally (racism, sexism, violence, trauma)
- Be thoughtful about how you discuss sensitive issues
- If a discussion becomes harmful, we'll pause and reset

**If a topic is affecting you:**
- You can step out briefly if needed (no explanation required)
- Talk to me in office hours if ongoing
- Seek support from CAPS if topic is triggering

**Justification**: [[classroom-conduct-reasons-v101#Intellectual Risk-Taking|Supporting difficult conversations]]

## Technology in the Classroom

### Appropriate Use

**Laptops/tablets allowed** for course-related work:
- Taking notes

- Accessing readings or assignment sheets on Canvas
- Peer review in Eli

**Inappropriate use:**
- Social media (unless part of course activity)
- Shopping, gaming, or entertainment
- Work for other courses
- Communication unrelated to class

**If technology becomes distraction:**
I may ask you to put device away for portion of class. This isn't punishment—it's helping you (and those around you) focus.

**What about phones?**
- Keep phones silent or vibrate
- Use only for emergencies or class-related tools (timer, quick reference)
- Step outside to take calls

**Justification**: [[classroom-conduct-reasons-v101#Technology Use|See Technology Use Policy]]

## Addressing Problems

### If You Have Concerns

**About my teaching or course design:**

**About a classmate's behavior:**
- Talk to me in office hours (I'll address it confidentially)
- For serious issues (harassment, discrimination), report to OEO or Dean of Students

**About your own situation:**
- If you're struggling with behavior expectations due to disability, mental health, or personal crisis, talk to me
- We can work with DRS to provide accommodations
- I'm here to support you, not punish you

**Justification**: [[classroom-conduct-reasons-v101#Conflict Resolution|Open communication approach]]

## Implementation

### Communication

**Week 1:** These expectations introduced in syllabus and discussed in class

**Ongoing:**
- I'll model respectful engagement in my interactions
- I'll address minor issues informally and promptly
- I'll reinforce positive norms (thanking students for thoughtful comments, etc.)

### Flexibility

**Different communication styles are welcome:**
- Introverts and extroverts both valued
- Written and verbal participation both count
- Prefer listening to speaking? That's fine—but find ways to contribute

**Cultural differences:**
- Classroom norms vary across cultures
- If you're unsure about expectations, ask
- I'll be explicit rather than assuming everyone knows implicit rules

**Justification**: [[classroom-conduct-reasons-v101#Implementation Approach|Inclusive design]]

**A:** Yes, but you're responsible for managing your attention. If I notice your laptop is consistently a distraction, I'll talk to you.
