## Design Philosophy

### Core Pedagogical Principle

Academic integrity policies should teach students how to participate ethically in scholarly conversations rather than simply punishing violations. The course frames citation, collaboration acknowledgment, and AI disclosure as **skills to learn** (not just rules to follow) because they reflect fundamental values of intellectual community: transparency, attribution, and respect for others' labor.

This policy embodies the course's commitment to **making invisible labor visible**. When students acknowledge sources, peer feedback, and AI assistance, they document the networked, collaborative nature of all intellectual work. The policy also distinguishes between disruptions to the **generative process** (submitting others' work as your own, which prevents learning) and **citation skill development** (which takes time and practice).

### Theoretical Grounding

**Citation as More Than Mechanics:**
- Traditional academic integrity policies treat citation as a mechanical compliance task ("cite to avoid plagiarism")
- This course frames citation as **intellectual practice**: signaling relationships, tracing ideas across time, mapping conversations
- Following Salvatori's conception of reading-writing as interconnected practices, citation represents one mechanism by which writers participate in ongoing scholarly dialogue

**Key Sources:**
- Salvatori, Mariolina Rizzi. "Conversations with Texts: Reading in the Teaching of Composition." *College English* 58.4 (1996): 440-454.
  - Citation connects writers to texts across time; it's relational, not just mechanical
- Howard, Rebecca Moore. "Plagiarisms, Authorships, and the Academic Death Penalty." *College English* 57.7 (1995): 788-806.
  - Distinguishes between "patchwriting" (developmental) and "plagiarism" (transgressive)
- Council of Writing Program Administrators. "Defining and Avoiding Plagiarism: The WPA Statement on Best Practices." 2003.
  - Plagiarism occurs when writers "deliberately" use unacknowledged sources

**Concepts Applied:**
- **Process over product**: Policy values documentation of development (workflow logs, revision history) as evidence of authentic engagement
- **Failure-as-diagnostic**: Citation errors are informational signals about what students need to learn
- **Constraint sequencing**: Students need explicit instruction and practice before being held fully accountable for citation conventions

## Policy Rationale

### Purpose & Goals

**What student behavior/learning does this policy support:**
1. **Transparent acknowledgment of intellectual debts**: Students learn to trace and credit the sources (human and algorithmic) that shape their thinking
2. **Ethical AI use**: Students develop critical awareness of AI tools' capabilities and limitations rather than either uncritical use or blanket prohibition
3. **Citation as scholarly practice**: Students understand citation not as punishment-avoidance but as participation in academic conversation
4. **Process documentation**: Students build habits of recording their writing development, which supports metacognition and portfolio reflection

**What this policy prevents:**
1. **Disruption of generative process**: Submitting others' work (human or AI-generated) prevents students from developing ideas through writing and feedback
2. **Punishing developmental errors**: Citation mistakes are learning opportunities, not moral failures
3. **Surveillance-based compliance**: Automated plagiarism detection undermines trust and shifts focus from learning to evasion

### Pedagogical Philosophy

**Alignment with course values:**

| VIRENS Principle | Policy Application |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Accumulation over episodes** | Citation and collaboration build across semester; portfolio can showcase growth even if earlier work had citation errors |
| **Process documentation** | Workflow logs and dev logs provide evidence of authentic writing process |
| **Iteration and revision** | Citation skills improve with practice and feedback; errors don't end learning opportunity |
| **Failure-as-diagnostic** | Citation mistakes reveal what needs teaching; they're informational, not punitive |
| **Writing as labor + capital** | Policy acknowledges collaborative labor (peer feedback, AI assistance) that produces textual capital |

**Why "disclose and reflect" for AI:**

Traditional binary approaches (ban AI entirely OR allow it without restriction) fail to prepare students for professional writing environments where AI tools are increasingly common. "Disclose and reflect" teaches:
- **Critical awareness**: What did the AI contribute? What did you accept/reject/modify?
- **Metacognition**: How did using the tool change your process?
- **Transparency**: Others can evaluate your work knowing what assistance you received

This aligns with composition pedagogy's emphasis on **rhetorical situation**: different writing contexts have different norms for collaboration and tool use. Students need practice navigating those norms, not just following blanket rules.

**Why distinguish Type 1 (severe) from Type 2 (teachable) plagiarism:**

This distinction honors research showing that "plagiarism" encompasses fundamentally different behaviors:
- **Type 1** represents deliberate deception that disrupts the entire course structure (I can't give feedback on writing you didn't produce; you can't learn from a process you didn't engage)
- **Type 2** represents developmental challenges with source integration—exactly what first-year composition courses teach

Treating both the same way either (a) over-penalizes students still learning citation conventions, or (b) under-responds to actual academic misconduct. The two-tiered approach allows appropriate response to each.

## Implementation Approach

### Communication Strategy

**Week 1:**
- Full policy in syllabus
- Class discussion: Why does citation matter? What counts as collaboration? How to document AI use?
- Students share examples of when they've acknowledged help in the past

**Week 3:**
- First citation workshop: MLA basics, when to quote vs. paraphrase vs. summarize
- Practice exercises with immediate feedback

**Week 7:**
- Second citation workshop: Integrating sources into arguments, signal phrases, citation as rhetoric
- Review common errors from student writing so far

**Week 11:**
- Third citation workshop: Complex citation scenarios, works cited page, troubleshooting

**Ongoing:**
- Every assignment prompt includes "Remember to cite sources and acknowledge assistance"
- Sample AI disclosure statements posted on Canvas
- Office hours available for citation questions

### Enforcement Philosophy

**Graduated response based on intent and impact:**

1. **Minor citation errors** (Type 2):
   - Instructor feedback: "You need quotation marks here" or "This paraphrase is too close to the original"
   - Student revises for portfolio
   - No academic misconduct report

2. **Moderate citation errors** (Type 2):
   - Conference with student to discuss source integration
   - Student rewrites section with proper attribution
   - Graded as revision (lower grade but not failure)
   - No academic misconduct report

3. **Full-text plagiarism** (Type 1):
   - Conference with student to review evidence
   - If confirmed: fail assignment, report to Assistant Director and Dean of Students
   - Depending on severity/repetition: may fail course

**How I identify potential plagiarism:**
- Knowledge of student's writing style developed over semester
- Inconsistencies in voice, sophistication, or terminology
- Process documentation (workflow logs) that don't align with submitted text
- Student unable to explain their writing choices or development process

**NOT:**
- Automated similarity-matching software
- Assumptions based on student demographic characteristics
- "Too good for this student" judgments

### Equity Considerations

**Built-in supports:**
1. **Citation taught explicitly**: Three workshops + ongoing office hours means students aren't expected to know MLA already
2. **Multiple chances**: Portfolio structure means early citation errors can be corrected through revision
3. **Ask-first culture**: "If you're unsure, ask" messaging emphasizes I'm here to help, not catch you
4. **Process documentation valued**: Workflow logs give benefit of doubt—if you can show your process, I can see your authentic engagement

**Potential inequities:**
1. **Citation convention knowledge**: Students from AP/IB backgrounds may enter with MLA experience; first-generation college students may not
   - **Mitigation**: Explicit teaching, no assumption of prior knowledge, workshops start from basics
2. **AI access**: Students with financial resources may have premium AI tools; others use free versions
   - **Mitigation**: Course doesn't require AI use; policy focuses on disclosure when used, not on using "good" AI
3. **English language proficiency**: Multilingual students may struggle more with paraphrasing and source integration
   - **Mitigation**: Errors treated as learning opportunities; Writing Center referrals; extra time for revision

**Why no automated detection:**
- Disproportionately flags multilingual students (non-native phrasing triggers false positives)
- Treats all students as suspects rather than learners
- Reduces complex rhetorical situations to algorithmic matching
- Violates student privacy and intellectual property rights (Turnitin stores student papers)

## Theoretical Grounding

### Research Base

**Academic Integrity and Plagiarism:**

- Howard, Rebecca Moore. "Plagiarisms, Authorships, and the Academic Death Penalty." *College English* 57.7 (1995): 788-806.
  - **Principle**: "Patchwriting" (close paraphrasing) is developmental stage, not moral failure
  - **Application**: Type 2 plagiarism treated as teachable moment, not misconduct

- Purdy, James P. "Calling Off the Hounds: Technology and the Visibility of Plagiarism." *Pedagogy* 5.2 (2005): 275-296.
  - **Principle**: Automated detection creates adversarial relationship; emphasizes policing over teaching
  - **Application**: Course relies on process documentation and instructor knowledge, not software

- Council of Writing Program Administrators. "Defining and Avoiding Plagiarism: The WPA Statement on Best Practices." 2003.
  - **Principle**: Plagiarism requires deliberate intent; institutions should teach citation, not just punish violations
  - **Application**: Policy distinguishes intent-based categories; emphasizes instruction

**AI and Writing Pedagogy:**

- Anson, Chris M., and Les Perelman. "The Threat of AI-Generated Text to Writing Assessment and Pedagogy." CCCC, 2023.
  - **Principle**: Banning AI is impractical and fails to prepare students for professional writing contexts
  - **Application**: "Disclose and reflect" teaches critical AI use rather than prohibition

- Wardle, Elizabeth, and Doug Downs. "Writing About Writing Pedagogy." *Composition Forum* 35 (2017).
  - **Principle**: Students learn best when they examine writing practices metacognitively
  - **Application**: Reflecting on AI use makes process visible, promotes metacognition

**Citation as Scholarly Practice:**

- Salvatori, Mariolina Rizzi. "Conversations with Texts: Reading in the Teaching of Composition." *College English* 58.4 (1996): 440-454.
  - **Principle**: Citation connects writers to ongoing conversations; it's relational work, not mechanical compliance
  - **Application**: Policy frames acknowledgment as participation in intellectual community

- Bartholomae, David. "Inventing the University." *Journal of Basic Writing* 5.1 (1986): 4-23.
  - **Principle**: Learning to write academically means learning discourse community conventions, including attribution
  - **Application**: Citation taught as way of speaking within academic community, not just rule-following

**Collaboration and Authorship:**

- Ede, Lisa, and Andrea Lunsford. "Collaboration and Concepts of Authorship." *PMLA* 116.2 (2001): 354-369.
  - **Principle**: All writing is collaborative; solo authorship is myth
  - **Application**: Policy acknowledges and values collaborative labor (peer feedback, AI assistance, instructor guidance)

- Bruffee, Kenneth. "Collaborative Learning and the 'Conversation of Mankind.'" *College English* 46.7 (1984): 635-652.
  - **Principle**: Knowledge is socially constructed; collaboration enhances learning
  - **Application**: Portfolio can showcase collaborative development with proper acknowledgment

**Process Documentation:**

- Flower, Linda, and John R. Hayes. "A Cognitive Process Theory of Writing." *College Composition and Communication* 32.4 (1981): 365-387.
  - **Principle**: Writing is recursive process involving planning, translating, reviewing
  - **Application**: Workflow logs document process, providing evidence of authentic engagement

### CCCC Position Statement

**Conference on College Composition and Communication. "CCCC Statement on Plagiarism Detection Services." 2006.**

Key excerpts informing this policy:

> "CCCC does not endorse the use of plagiarism detection services because:
> - They potentially undermine students' agency as writers
> - They treat all students as always already plagiarists
> - They create a hostile learning environment
> - They shift responsibility of identifying and interpreting source misuse from teachers to technology
> - They compel students to agree to licensing agreements that threaten their privacy and rights to their own intellectual property"

**Application in this course:**
- No Turnitin or similar services
- Reliance on instructor knowledge of student writing development
- Process documentation (workflow logs, drafts) as evidence of authentic work
- Trust-based relationship: policy assumes good faith, addresses violations case-by-case

## Known Tensions

### Potential Issues

**Issue**: Students may interpret "disclose and reflect" as permission to have AI write entire drafts
**Response**: Policy explicitly states AI should assist thinking, not replace it. Workflow logs and ability to explain choices help distinguish appropriate from inappropriate AI use. If student can't explain their process or decision-making, that signals over-reliance on AI.

**Issue**: International students or students unfamiliar with U.S. academic culture may have different prior understanding of plagiarism and collaboration
**Response**: Policy presented as what this course values rather than universal truth. Week 1 discussion makes space for students to share different cultural norms around authorship and citation. Workshops explicitly teach MLA conventions without assuming prior knowledge.

**Issue**: Two-tiered plagiarism response may be perceived as subjective or unfair ("Why did X get a warning but Y failed?")
**Response**: Policy makes distinction clear (intent + impact). Documentation of decision-making (conference notes, evidence reviewed) ensures consistency. Students have opportunity to provide evidence (workflow logs, drafts) showing their process.

**Issue**: Some students may game the system by creating fake workflow logs
**Response**: Workflow log quality is visible over semester; consistent documentation harder to fake than single instance. Discussion of writing choices in office hours or conferences reveals whether student can explain their process. Risk is low because workflow logs are formative (graded on completion, not quality).

**Issue**: Balancing trust with accountability—how to verify authentic engagement without surveillance?
**Response**: Portfolio structure requires students to demonstrate growth over time, which is difficult to fake. Process documentation accumulates throughout semester. Conference-based verification (discussing writing choices) more effective than automated detection.

### Competing Values

**Value tension**: **Trust vs. verification**
- Trust-based approach (no automated detection) assumes good faith
- But university requires faculty to report academic misconduct
- **Resolution**: Policy uses process documentation as verification without surveillance. Workflow logs, drafts, and ability to discuss writing choices provide evidence.

**Value tension**: **Standardization vs. individualization**
- University policy applies same standards across all students
- But students have different prior knowledge, language backgrounds, cultural contexts
- **Resolution**: Two-tiered response allows individualization (Type 2 errors addressed through teaching) while maintaining clear boundaries (Type 1 still fails assignment).

**Value tension**: **AI as tool vs. AI as replacement**
- Professional writing contexts use AI tools; banning them is unrealistic
- But first-year students may lack critical awareness to use AI responsibly
- **Resolution**: "Disclose and reflect" scaffolds critical AI use. Students learn to evaluate AI contributions rather than accepting them uncritically.

## Evidence & Iteration

### Evidence to Collect

**Policy effectiveness**:
- [ ] How many students disclose AI use in their fragments/portfolio?
- [ ] Do students' AI disclosure statements show critical reflection or just compliance?
- [ ] How many Type 2 citation errors in mid-semester work vs. portfolio work? (Should decrease)
- [ ] Student understanding of policy (mid-semester survey: "Can you explain this course's AI policy?")

**Student learning**:
- [ ] Citation accuracy improving over semester? (Sample 5 students' work Week 3 vs. Week 15)
- [ ] Portfolio cover letters citing peer feedback, instructor comments, or AI use as part of development?
- [ ] Students able to explain why they cited specific sources in portfolio?

**Equity indicators**:
- [ ] Are Type 2 plagiarism rates higher for specific student populations? (Might indicate need for additional support)
- [ ] Are multilingual students or first-generation students receiving disproportionate Type 2 designations? (Would require enhanced scaffolding)

### Revision Notes

**Based on piloting, consider adjusting:**

- **AI disclosure format**: If students struggle with "disclose and reflect," provide a template: "I used [tool] to [specific action]. The tool suggested [X]. I accepted/rejected/modified this because [reason]."
- **Citation workshop timing**: If Week 3 is too early (students haven't written enough yet to have citation questions), move to Week 4. If Week 11 is too late (portfolio drafts need citations earlier), move to Week 9.
- **Type 1/Type 2 clarity**: If students or colleagues find distinction ambiguous, add specific examples to policy document
- **Portfolio collaboration evidence**: If students under-acknowledge collaboration (not citing peer feedback, AI use), require explicit section in cover letter: "Collaboration and Assistance I Received"
