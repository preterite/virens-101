## Policy Statement

### Communication as Part of Learning

This course treats communication—between you and me, between you and your peers, and between you and the broader academic community—as central to learning, not just logistical necessity. The course includes multiple communication channels, each serving different purposes. Understanding when and how to use each channel effectively is part of developing as a writer and as a professional.

This policy explains expectations for email, office hours, peer review, and instructor feedback to help you get the support you need and engage productively with the class community.

**Justification**: [[communication-expectations-reasons-v101#Policy Rationale|Why these expectations?]]

---

## Email Communication

### When to Email

Email is best for:
- **Logistical questions** with simple answers (due dates, assignment clarifications, absence notifications)
- **Scheduling** office hours appointments
- **Time-sensitive issues** that need attention before next class
- **Sharing documents** or links that require my review

Email is not ideal for:
- **Detailed feedback on your writing** (use office hours instead—writing is hard to discuss asynchronously)
- **Grade discussions** (these require conversation; schedule office hours)
- **Complex questions** about assignments or course concepts (office hours are more productive)

### Email Response Time

**I will respond to emails within 24 hours on weekdays** (Monday-Friday), except:
- Emails sent after 5pm Friday will receive response by Monday
- Emails sent during university breaks may have longer response time
- Emails requiring detailed response (e.g., reviewing an attachment) may take up to 48 hours

**If your issue is urgent** (illness preventing you from attending class that day, family emergency, crisis), say so in the subject line: "URGENT: [brief description]"

### Effective Email Practices

**Subject line:** Specific and informative
- ✓ Good: "ENGL101: Question about Week 5 peer review deadline"
- ✗ Poor: "question" or "help"

**Greeting:** Professional but friendly
- ✓ Good: "Hi Professor Edwards," or "Dr. Edwards,"
- ✗ Poor: "Hey" or no greeting

**Message:** 
- State your question or issue clearly
- Include relevant context (which assignment, what you've already tried)
- If asking about an assignment, confirm you've read the assignment sheet and course policies first

**Signature:** Your name and section number
- ✓ Good: "Thanks, Jamie Rodriguez (ENGL101.16)"

**Justification**: [[communication-expectations-reasons-v101#Email Guidelines|Why these practices?]]

## Office Hours

### Purpose and Philosophy

**Office hours are for you.** They're not just for students who are struggling—they're for anyone who wants to:
- Discuss ideas for upcoming writing
- Get feedback on drafts in progress
- Ask questions about readings or concepts
- Clarify assignment expectations
- Discuss your progress in the course
- Talk about connections between this course and your other interests

You don't need an "official" reason to come to office hours. "I'd like to talk about my writing" is always a good enough reason.

### Logistics

**When:** [To be filled in with actual office hours schedule]
**Where:** [To be filled in with actual location]
**How:** Drop-in (first-come, first-served) OR by appointment (email to schedule)

**If you can't make scheduled office hours:** Email me to arrange an alternative time. I'm flexible and want to meet with you.

### What to Bring

For **writing feedback**, bring:
- The draft (digital or printed)
- Specific questions or concerns ("I'm struggling with how to organize this section" is more helpful than "Is this good?")
- Any peer feedback you've received (so we can build on it)

For **assignment clarification**, bring:
- The assignment sheet
- Your understanding of what's being asked
- Specific points of confusion

### Office Hours vs. Email

**Use office hours (not email) for:**
- Writing feedback and revision advice
- Grade discussions or reconsiderations
- Complex questions requiring back-and-forth conversation
- Big-picture questions about your progress in the course

**Why:** These conversations are more productive in real-time, and writing is difficult to discuss asynchronously.

**Justification**: [[communication-expectations-reasons-v101#Office Hours Philosophy|Why prioritize office hours?]]

## Peer Review (Eli Review)

### Purpose

Peer review is not just about helping others—it's about learning to read critically and apply criteria. When you give feedback, you're practicing the same evaluative skills you'll use when revising your own writing.

### Expectations

**Participation in every peer review cycle:**
- **Submit your draft on time** (so others have material to review)
- **Review all assigned peers** (typically 3-4 classmates)
- **Write substantive feedback** (see guidelines below)
- **Complete revision plan** based on feedback you received

**Deadlines are firm:** Peer review cycles depend on synchronous participation. If you don't submit your draft on time, you can't receive feedback. If you don't review your assigned peers, they don't get feedback. Late submissions cannot be accommodated.

**If you miss a peer review cycle:** You'll receive a 0 for that cycle. You can still pass the course, but multiple missed cycles will significantly impact your grade. Plan ahead and prioritize peer review deadlines.

### Quality Feedback

**Substantive feedback includes:**

1. **Describe what you see**: Summarize the writer's main argument or purpose without evaluating yet
   - "Your draft argues that [X] because [Y evidence]"
   - "You're trying to convince readers to [action] by showing [reasoning]"

2. **Evaluate against criteria**: Use the assignment rubric to assess specific elements
   - "Your evidence in paragraph 3 directly supports your claim, which meets the 'relevant evidence' criterion"
   - "Your introduction doesn't yet forecast your main points, which the rubric asks for"

3. **Suggest specific revisions**: Give actionable advice, not just criticism
   - ✓ Good: "Consider adding a transition between paragraphs 2 and 3 to show how these ideas connect"
   - ✗ Poor: "This is confusing"

**Length:** 150-300 words per review (quality over quantity)

**Tone:** Respectful and helpful. Your goal is to help your peer improve, not to prove you're smarter.

### Using Feedback You Receive

**Revision plan (required after each peer review):**
- Which feedback will you use? Why?
- Which feedback will you not use? Why?
- What specific changes will you make?

You're not required to accept all feedback—but you are required to consider it and explain your decisions.

**Justification**: [[communication-expectations-reasons-v101#Peer Review Design|Why these expectations?]]

## Instructor Feedback

### What You'll Receive

I provide feedback at different points in your writing process:

**Formative feedback (ongoing):**
- Brief comments on selected fragments (spot-check, not all fragments)
- Detailed comments on reflective one-pagers (all four)
- General observations during class on common patterns I'm seeing
- Individual check-ins during in-class writing sessions

**Summative feedback (end of semester):**
- Holistic assessment of portfolio
- Comments on each portfolio piece
- Evaluation using course outcomes rubric

### What Feedback Looks Like

**On fragments and drafts:**
- Questions to help you develop your thinking ("What evidence would convince a skeptic?")
- Identification of patterns ("You tend to assert claims without explaining your reasoning")
- Suggestions for revision ("Consider reorganizing to address the counterargument first")

**NOT:**
- Line-by-line editing (that's your job, with help from Writing Center if needed)
- Rewriting your sentences (I'll identify issues; you'll solve them)
- Grades on individual fragments (formative work is completion-based)

### Timeline

**Fragment feedback:** I'll provide comments on 3-5 fragments per student during the semester (you won't know which ones in advance—this encourages consistent effort)

**Reflective one-pager feedback:** Within one week of submission

**Portfolio feedback:** Within one week of final submission (or according to university grading deadline, whichever is sooner)

### Using My Feedback

**Feedback is formative—it's meant to inform your revision:**
- Read feedback carefully (don't just look at the grade, if there is one)
- Ask questions if you don't understand (office hours, email)
- Refer back to feedback when revising for portfolio
- Cite specific feedback in your portfolio cover letter ("Professor Edwards' comment that my evidence didn't support my claim led me to restructure this section")

**Justification**: [[communication-expectations-reasons-v101#Feedback Strategy|Why this approach?]]

---

## Class Discussion and Participation

### In-Class Expectations

**Flipped classroom model:** Most writing happens in class, most reading happens for homework, discussion happens both in-class and online.

**During class:**
- Bring required materials (notebook/laptop, readings if assigned, assignment sheets)
- Participate in generative writing activities
- Contribute to small group discussions
- Ask questions when you're confused
- Respect others' speaking time (don't dominate; don't withdraw)

**Laptops/tablets:** Allowed for course-related work. If I notice devices creating distraction, I'll address it individually.

### Online Discussion (if applicable)

**Canvas discussion boards** (if used) operate asynchronously:
- Initial posts due by stated deadline
- Responses to peers due by stated deadline
- Posts should extend conversation, not just agree ("Great point!")
- Cite specific passages from readings when relevant

**Justification**: [[communication-expectations-reasons-v101#Discussion Design|Why these formats?]]

---

## Response Time Expectations (Both Ways)

### What You Can Expect from Me

**Email:** 24 hours on weekdays (48 hours if detailed response needed)

**Fragment feedback:** Unpredictable which fragments, but 3-5 per student during semester

**Reflective one-pager feedback:** Within one week

**Peer review setup:** At least one week notice before each peer review cycle

**Office hours:** Available during posted times; flexible for appointments

**Grade questions:** Discussed in office hours (not email)

### What I Expect from You

**Submitting work:** By stated deadlines (late penalties apply)

**Responding to my feedback:** Acknowledge in your revision or explain why you chose not to follow it (portfolio cover letter is good place for this)

**Scheduling meetings:** At least 24 hours notice if you need to schedule outside office hours

**Canceling appointments:** Email ASAP if you can't make a scheduled appointment

**Reading syllabus and assignment sheets:** Before emailing questions answered there

**Justification**: [[communication-expectations-reasons-v101#Reciprocal Expectations|Why mutual accountability?]]

## Communication Challenges

### If You're Struggling

**With the course:**
- Come to office hours (we can discuss strategies)
- Be specific about what's difficult (content, time management, specific skills)
- Ask early (Week 3 is better than Week 13)

**With me:**
- If my feedback doesn't make sense, ask me to clarify
- If you feel I've been unfair, let's discuss it (office hours are best for this)
- If communication isn't working, we can try different approaches

### If I Need to Reach You

**I'll use your WSU email** for all course communication. Check it regularly.

**If you don't respond:** I may reach out via Canvas message or speak to you in class

**If there's an academic concern:** I'll contact you directly before taking any formal action (grade warnings, academic integrity issues)

### Respectful Communication

**Basic expectations:**
- Professional tone in email and formal communication
- Respectful disagreement is fine; dismissiveness or hostility is not
- Recognize that I'm a person with limits on time and energy (as are you)
- No communication is better than hostile communication (if you're upset, wait 24 hours before sending email)

**If there's a conflict:** Let's address it directly rather than letting it fester

**Justification**: [[communication-expectations-reasons-v101#Conflict Resolution|Why address tensions?]]

---

## Implementation

### Communication

**Week 1:** This policy introduced in syllabus and discussed in class

**Ongoing:** 
- Remind students of communication channels as relevant ("This is an office-hours question, not an email question")
- Model good communication practices in my emails and feedback
- Check in mid-semester: Are communication channels working for you?

### Exceptions & Flexibility

**Documented emergencies or accommodations:**
- If illness/crisis prevents you from meeting deadlines or attending office hours, email me ASAP
- We'll work out alternative arrangements
- DRS accommodations may include modified communication methods

**Technology access:**
- If you can't access email regularly, let me know and we'll find alternative check-in method
- If you can't attend office hours due to work/family schedule, we'll schedule alternative times

**Language or communication differences:**
- If you're more comfortable with written or verbal communication, we can emphasize one
- If English is not your first language and you need extra time to compose emails or understand feedback, that's fine—just let me know

**Justification**: [[communication-expectations-reasons-v101#Implementation Approach|Philosophy]]

## Student Support

### Resources

**Email Help:**
- WSU Guide to Professional Email: [link if available]
- Writing Center can help with professional communication

**Office Hours Help:**
- Don't know what to ask? Start with "I'd like feedback on my draft" or "I'm confused about the assignment"
- Bring specific sections of writing or specific questions

**Peer Review Help:**
- Eli Review tutorials: Available in Canvas
- Practice peer review in class before first cycle
- Sample feedback examples posted on Canvas

### Common Questions

**Q: How do I know if my question is too small for office hours?**
**A:** There are no too-small questions. If you're wondering about it, it's worth discussing. Even "I just wanted to check in about my progress" is a valid reason to come to office hours.

**Q: What if I'm too nervous to come to office hours?**
**A:** I get it—office hours can feel intimidating. Try emailing first to schedule an appointment (less awkward than dropping in). Bring a friend from class if that helps. Or just show up and say "I'm nervous but I wanted to talk about my writing." We'll figure it out together.

**Q: Can I email you my draft for feedback instead of coming to office hours?**
**A:** I prefer office hours for draft feedback because it's more productive to discuss your writing in real-time. But if you absolutely can't make office hours (work schedule, family obligations), email me and we'll work something out.

**Q: What if I disagree with peer feedback I received?**
**A:** You're not required to use all peer feedback. In your revision plan, explain why you're not using specific suggestions. If you want to discuss whether peer feedback is on-track, bring it to office hours.

**Q: Do I need to respond to your feedback on my fragments?**
**A:** Not directly, but you should use the feedback when revising. Your portfolio cover letter is a good place to cite specific instructor feedback that shaped your revision.
