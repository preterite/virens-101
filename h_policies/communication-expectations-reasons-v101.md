## Design Philosophy

### Core Pedagogical Principle

Communication is not merely logistical infrastructure for a course—it's central to learning itself. Writing develops through dialogue: between writer and reader, between draft and feedback, between current understanding and revised understanding. This policy treats communication channels as **pedagogical tools** with different affordances for different kinds of learning.

The course's emphasis on **process documentation** and **iteration** requires **timely, substantive feedback** through multiple channels. Students need to learn when to use synchronous communication (office hours, in-class discussion) versus asynchronous (email, Eli Review), when to seek instructor feedback versus peer feedback, and how to integrate feedback into revision. These are not just logistical skills—they're **professional communication competencies** and **metacognitive practices** that support transfer beyond the course.

### Theoretical Grounding

**Feedback as Dialogue:**
- Traditional feedback models position instructor as authoritative evaluator delivering one-way pronouncements
- Dialogic feedback models (Nicol, Sommers) position feedback as part of ongoing conversation that students actively interpret and apply
- This policy structures multiple feedback loops (peer, instructor, self-assessment) rather than single evaluative moment

**Key Sources:**
- Nicol, David. "From Monologue to Dialogue: Improving Written Feedback Processes in Mass Higher Education." *Assessment & Evaluation in Higher Education* 35.5 (2010): 501-517.
  - Feedback most effective when students actively engage with it, not passively receive it
- Sommers, Nancy. "Responding to Student Writing." *College Composition and Communication* 33.2 (1982): 148-156.
  - Teacher comments should facilitate revision, not justify grades; should be formative, not summative
- Ferris, Dana R. *Treatment of Error in Second Language Student Writing*. U of Michigan P, 2002.
  - Timing and type of feedback matter; not all errors need correcting at all stages

**Concepts Applied:**
- **Dialogic feedback**: Revision plans require students to interpret and respond to feedback, not just accept it
- **Formative assessment**: Most feedback given before grading, during development
- **Peer learning**: Students learn by giving feedback, not just receiving it
- **Metacognition**: Explaining decisions about which feedback to use develops self-awareness

## Policy Rationale

### Purpose & Goals

**What student behavior/learning does this policy support:**

1. **Strategic communication channel use**: Students learn when email is appropriate vs. when synchronous discussion is needed
2. **Professional communication skills**: Email etiquette, scheduling, respectful disagreement
3. **Peer review as learning**: Students develop critical reading and evaluative skills by reviewing others
4. **Active engagement with feedback**: Students interpret, evaluate, and apply feedback rather than passively receiving it
5. **Process documentation**: Communication about writing process (in revision plans, office hours) makes invisible labor visible

**What this policy prevents:**

1. **Passive feedback reception**: "Revision plan" requirement prevents students from ignoring feedback
2. **Last-minute panic**: Clear timelines and deadlines help students plan ahead
3. **Mismatched communication channels**: Email guidelines steer complex questions toward office hours
4. **Peer review as box-checking**: Quality criteria ensure substantive engagement
5. **Instructor bottleneck**: Peer review provides formative feedback; instructor feedback is strategic

### Pedagogical Philosophy

**Alignment with course values:**

| VIRENS Principle | Communication Policy Application |
|-----------------|----------------------------------|
| **Process documentation** | Revision plans document how feedback was interpreted; office hours conversations become part of process |
| **Iteration and revision** | Multiple feedback loops (peer, instructor, self) across semester support iterative development |
| **Failure-as-diagnostic** | Peer review feedback identifies what's not working; revision plan explains how to address it |
| **Accumulation over episodes** | Fragments receive selective feedback to encourage consistent production; portfolio receives comprehensive feedback |
| **Constraint sequencing** | Peer review criteria gradually increase in complexity across semester |

**Channel-specific pedagogical purposes:**

**Email:**
- **Affordance**: Asynchronous, documented, good for simple questions and scheduling
- **Limitation**: Poor for complex discussion, lacks tone/nuance, easy to misinterpret
- **Pedagogical use**: Logistics, quick clarifications, maintaining connection
- **NOT for**: Writing feedback (too slow, lacks dialogue), grade discussions (requires back-and-forth)

**Office hours:**
- **Affordance**: Synchronous dialogue, can show examples, can ask follow-up questions
- **Limitation**: Requires scheduling, intimidating for some students, limited capacity
- **Pedagogical use**: Deep discussion of writing, grade clarification, complex questions, building relationship
- **Prioritized for**: Draft feedback, conceptual questions, individual writing development

**Peer review (Eli):**
- **Affordance**: Multiple perspectives, timely (embedded in writing process), students learn by reviewing
- **Limitation**: Peers not expert readers, variable quality, requires structure
- **Pedagogical use**: Formative feedback, practicing evaluative skills, exposure to multiple approaches
- **Why structured**: Describe-Evaluate-Suggest pattern teaches systematic critical reading

**In-class discussion:**
- **Affordance**: Immediate, communal, low-stakes, builds on others' ideas
- **Limitation**: Fleeting (not documented), favors verbal processors, time-limited
- **Pedagogical use**: Generative thinking, collaborative problem-solving, building class community
- **Why flipped model**: Writing in class ensures all students have material to discuss; reading at home uses asynchronous time efficiently

## Implementation Approach

### Communication Strategy

**Week 1:**
- Full policy in syllabus
- Class discussion: When have you received helpful feedback? What made it helpful?
- Practice email: Students compose professional email to me with fake question, exchange with peer for review

**Week 2:**
- First office hours push: Everyone should come at least once during first four weeks
- Model peer review process in class (without Eli, just practice describing-evaluating-suggesting)

**Week 3:**
- First peer review cycle in Eli
- Debrief: What was helpful? What was confusing? How can you improve as reviewer?

**Ongoing:**
- After each peer review cycle: Revision plan reflection ("Which feedback will you use? Why?")
- Mid-semester check-in (Week 8): Are communication channels working for you?
- Model responding to feedback in sample student work (with permission)

### Enforcement Philosophy

**Firm deadlines on peer review:**
- **Why**: Cycles depend on synchronous participation; one person's late submission impacts 3-4 peers
- **How**: Eli Review closes submissions at deadline; no late submissions possible
- **Equity consideration**: Clear advance notice (at least one week) allows planning

**Flexible on email/office hours:**
- **Why**: Life happens; communication shouldn't be punitive
- **How**: Flexible scheduling, alternative meeting times if needed
- **Equity consideration**: Students with work/family obligations may need evening/weekend options

**Quality expectations on peer feedback:**
- **Why**: Low-quality feedback ("Good job!") doesn't help writer or reviewer learn
- **How**: Eli analytics track helpfulness ratings (peers rate each other's feedback); instructor spot-checks
- **Equity consideration**: Explicit criteria (Describe-Evaluate-Suggest) give all students access to "good feedback" model

### Equity Considerations

**Office hours access:**
- **Barrier**: Students with jobs, family obligations, commutes may struggle to attend daytime office hours
- **Mitigation**: Offer some evening/early morning appointments by request; Zoom option for students who can't come to campus
- **Barrier**: First-generation or marginalized students may feel intimidated by professor's office
- **Mitigation**: Normalize office hours in Week 1; make first visit low-stakes (no agenda needed); welcome students to bring classmate

**Peer review participation:**
- **Barrier**: Students who miss class due to illness/emergency miss peer review cycle entirely (0 for that cycle)
- **Mitigation**: Clear advance notice allows planning; DRS accommodations may include modified peer review requirements
- **Barrier**: Multilingual students or students with writing anxiety may feel self-conscious sharing drafts
- **Mitigation**: Peer review early in semester is low-stakes; feedback criteria focus on content/ideas, not surface correctness

**Email/technology access:**
- **Barrier**: Some students check email infrequently or lack consistent internet access
- **Mitigation**: Communicate deadlines in class and via Canvas; critical information repeated in multiple channels
- **Barrier**: Students unfamiliar with professional email norms may send inappropriate messages
- **Mitigation**: Week 1 practice email with feedback; explicit guidelines in policy; grace for first offense

**Feedback interpretation:**
- **Barrier**: Instructor feedback may use unfamiliar terminology (rhetoric, claims, evidence)
- **Mitigation**: Feedback written in accessible language; students encouraged to ask for clarification; office hours used to discuss confusing feedback
- **Barrier**: Students from educational contexts that don't emphasize revision may not know how to use feedback
- **Mitigation**: Revision plan template scaffolds response to feedback; reflection on feedback process built into course

## Theoretical Grounding

### Research Base

**Feedback Effectiveness:**

- Nicol, David. "From Monologue to Dialogue: Improving Written Feedback Processes in Mass Higher Education." *Assessment & Evaluation in Higher Education* 35.5 (2010): 501-517.
  - **Principle**: Feedback works when students actively engage with it, compare it to their self-assessment, and use it to regulate future learning
  - **Application**: Revision plans require students to actively interpret feedback and decide how to apply it

- Sommers, Nancy. "Responding to Student Writing." *College Composition and Communication* 33.2 (1982): 148-156.
  - **Principle**: Teacher comments should facilitate revision, not justify grades; "rubber-stamping" existing drafts doesn't help
  - **Application**: Formative feedback during semester; summative evaluation only on portfolio

- Straub, Richard. "The Student, the Text, and the Classroom Context: A Case Study of Teacher Response." *Assessing Writing* 7.1 (2000): 23-55.
  - **Principle**: Effective feedback is timely, specific, actionable, and linked to course goals
  - **Application**: Fragment feedback targets specific patterns; portfolio feedback references course outcomes

**Peer Review Pedagogy:**

- Lundstrom, Kristi, and Wendy Baker. "To Give Is Better Than to Receive: The Benefits of Peer Review to the Reviewer's Own Writing." *Journal of Second Language Writing* 18.1 (2009): 30-43.
  - **Principle**: Students learn more from giving feedback than from receiving it (develops evaluative judgment)
  - **Application**: Peer review valued as learning activity, not just service to peers

- Cho, Kwangsu, and Charles MacArthur. "Student Revision with Peer and Expert Reviewing." *Learning and Instruction* 20.4 (2010): 328-338.
  - **Principle**: Peer feedback effective when combined with expert feedback and structured revision process
  - **Application**: Peer review + instructor feedback + revision plan = multiple feedback sources

- Topping, Keith. "Peer Assessment Between Students in Colleges and Universities." *Review of Educational Research* 68.3 (1998): 249-276.
  - **Principle**: Structured peer assessment (with criteria) more effective than unstructured
  - **Application**: Describe-Evaluate-Suggest framework; assignment-specific rubrics in Eli

**Communication and Transfer:**

- Beaufort, Anne. *College Writing and Beyond: A New Framework for University Writing Instruction*. Utah State UP, 2007.
  - **Principle**: Professional communication skills (email, scheduling, responding to feedback) transfer beyond academic contexts
  - **Application**: Policy teaches communication as transferable professional competency

- Anson, Chris M., and Jessie L. Moore. *Critical Transitions: Writing and the Question of Transfer*. WAC Clearinghouse, 2016.
  - **Principle**: Metacognitive reflection on communication practices supports transfer
  - **Application**: Revision plans require students to articulate decision-making about feedback use

**Process Pedagogy:**

- Flower, Linda, and John R. Hayes. "A Cognitive Process Theory of Writing." *College Composition and Communication* 32.4 (1981): 365-387.
  - **Principle**: Writing is recursive; revision is central, not peripheral
  - **Application**: Multiple feedback loops across semester support recursive revision process

- Elbow, Peter. *Writing with Power: Techniques for Mastering the Writing Process*. 2nd ed. Oxford UP, 1998.
  - **Principle**: Different stages of writing need different kinds of feedback (early: generative; late: critical)
  - **Application**: Fragment feedback formative/generative; portfolio feedback evaluative

## Email Guidelines

### Why Specific Email Expectations?

Professional email is a genre with conventions students may not have encountered. Explicit instruction (subject line, greeting, clarity, signature) teaches transferable communication skill. Many students have primarily communicated with instructors via Canvas messages or informal texting; professional email norms are not intuitive.

**Research supporting explicit email instruction:**
- Beason, Larry. "Ethos and Error: How Business People React to Errors." *College Composition and Communication* 53.1 (2001): 33-64.
  - Professional readers make judgments about competence based on communication quality
  
**Application:** Week 1 practice email gives students low-stakes opportunity to learn/practice conventions before real communication

### Why 24-Hour Response Time (Not Faster)?

**Student expectations**: Some students expect instant response (influenced by texting norms)

**Instructor capacity**: Responding to 24 students' emails requires time; immediate response is unsustainable

**Pedagogical rationale**: 
- Teaching students that not all communication is instant is part of professional development
- Encouraging students to plan ahead rather than expect last-minute help
- Modeling work-life boundaries (I don't answer emails at 11pm)

**Equity consideration**: 
- Clear timeline prevents "squeaky wheel gets oil" dynamic (students who email repeatedly don't get faster service)
- Students with urgent needs can identify them (subject line: URGENT)

## Office Hours Philosophy

### Why Prioritize Face-to-Face Over Email for Writing Feedback?

**Pedagogical reasons:**
1. **Dialogue is more productive than monologue**: Can ask follow-up questions, check understanding, adjust based on student's response
2. **Writing is complex**: Hard to discuss rhetorical choices asynchronously; easier to point to specific passages and discuss in real-time
3. **Builds relationship**: Students more likely to engage with feedback from instructor they've talked with
4. **Metacognition**: Verbalizing writing choices helps students understand their own process

**Practical reasons:**
1. **Time efficiency**: 15-minute conversation more efficient than multiple email exchanges
2. **Preventing misinterpretation**: Tone hard to convey in text; easier to clarify in person
3. **Reducing email overload**: If all 24 students email drafts, responding to each is unsustainable

**Research base:**
- Eckstein, Grant. "Grammar Correction in the Writing Centre: Expectations and Experiences of Monolingual and Multilingual Writers." *Canadian Modern Language Review* 72.3 (2016): 360-382.
  - One-on-one feedback conversation more effective than written comments for complex issues

### Why "No Too-Small Questions"?

**Barrier**: Students often think their questions are too trivial for office hours

**Impact**: Students don't get help they need because they're embarrassed to ask

**Mitigation**: Explicit messaging that all questions are valid; normalizing office hours as routine, not emergency-only

**Pedagogical benefit**: 
- Students who come regularly build relationship with instructor
- Small questions often reveal larger conceptual gaps that can be addressed
- Office hours become low-stakes space for thinking aloud about writing

## Peer Review Design

### Why Eli Review (Structured Platform)?

**Advantages over informal peer review:**
1. **Ensures participation**: System tracks who reviewed whom; can't skip without it being visible
2. **Structured feedback**: Prompts guide students through Describe-Evaluate-Suggest framework
3. **Analytics**: Instructor can see quality of feedback (peers rate each other's helpfulness)
4. **Revision planning**: Built-in space for students to respond to feedback they received
5. **Timing control**: Can set deadlines to ensure synchronous participation

**Disadvantages:**
1. **Learning curve**: Students need to learn system (mitigated by in-class tutorial in Week 2)
2. **Rigid deadlines**: Can't accommodate late submissions (mitigated by clear advance notice)
3. **Cost**: Students pay ~$12/semester (mitigated by replacing more expensive textbook)

**Why worth it:** Structure and accountability outweigh learning curve and cost

### Why Describe-Evaluate-Suggest Framework?

**Describe**: 
- Forces reviewer to actually read and comprehend before criticizing
- Helps writer see how their intended message is/isn't landing
- Prevents "I liked it!" or "This is bad" non-feedback

**Evaluate**:
- Teaches criteria-based assessment (using rubric)
- Develops evaluative judgment reviewer will use on own writing
- Gives writer specific understanding of strengths/weaknesses

**Suggest**:
- Requires actionable advice, not just criticism
- Models revision thinking (if this isn't working, what would?)
- Balances critical reading with constructive support

**Research base:**
- Cho, Young Hoan, and Kwangsu Cho. "Peer Reviewers Learn from Giving Comments." *Instructional Science* 39.5 (2011): 629-643.
  - Structured feedback prompts improve both feedback quality and reviewer learning

### Why Firm Peer Review Deadlines?

**Pedagogical rationale:**
- Synchronous participation is essential: if Student A submits late, Students B, C, and D have nothing to review
- Teaches professional accountability: in workplace, missing collaborative deadlines impacts team

**Practical rationale:**
- Eli Review system closes at deadline; manual overrides are labor-intensive and disrupt cycle timing
- If deadline is soft, students wait until last minute; if firm, students plan ahead

**Equity consideration:**
- Clear advance notice (at least one week) allows students to plan around work/family obligations
- DRS accommodations may include modified deadlines for documented needs
- Multiple peer review cycles means one missed cycle doesn't fail student

---

## Feedback Strategy

### Why Selective Fragment Feedback (Not All Fragments)?

**Student expectation**: Some students expect feedback on every piece of writing

**Instructor capacity**: Providing detailed feedback on 3-4 fragments/week Ã— 24 students = 72-96 fragments/week (unsustainable)

**Pedagogical rationale:**
- **Encourages intrinsic motivation**: Students write fragments for their own development, not for teacher's approval
- **Prevents "teaching to the comments"**: If students don't know which fragments will receive feedback, they can't game the system
- **Values peer feedback**: Eli Review provides formative feedback on all substantial drafts; instructor feedback is strategic addition, not sole source
- **Portfolio focus**: Comprehensive instructor feedback at end, when stakes are highest and revision most purposeful

**Research base:**
- Elbow, Peter. "Ranking, Evaluating, and Liking: Sorting Out Three Forms of Judgment." *College English* 55.2 (1993): 187-206.
  - Not all writing needs evaluative feedback; sometimes acknowledgment of labor is enough

### Why One Week for Reflective One-Pager Feedback?

**These are highest-value feedback targets because:**
1. Reflective one-pagers synthesize learning across multiple fragments
2. They prepare students for portfolio cover letter (most important metacognitive writing)
3. They're short (500-750 words) so detailed feedback is feasible
4. They're tied to course outcomes, making feedback directly relevant to final assessment

**One week timeline:**
- Allows thoughtful, detailed response
- Still timely enough to inform next reflective one-pager
- Balances instructor capacity with student need

---

## Reciprocal Expectations

### Why Mutual Accountability?

**Traditional model**: Instructor has power; students have obligations

**Problem with traditional model**: 
- Creates compliance-based relationship rather than collaborative learning
- Students become passive recipients rather than active agents
- Obscures that teaching-learning is shared work

**Alternative model (this policy):**
- Instructor commits to response times, feedback quality, availability
- Students commit to meeting deadlines, engaging with feedback, asking questions
- Both parties accountable for making communication productive

**Pedagogical benefit:**
- Models professional relationships (mutual expectations, not hierarchical control)
- Encourages students to advocate for their needs
- Builds trust (I'm reliable; you can count on me if you're reliable too)

**Research base:**
- hooks, bell. *Teaching to Transgress: Education as the Practice of Freedom*. Routledge, 1994.
  - Education most transformative when it's collaborative rather than hierarchical

## Known Tensions

### Potential Issues

**Issue**: Students may email complex questions (requiring long response) instead of coming to office hours
**Response**: Email response will be "This is an office-hours question—let's schedule time to discuss" with link to scheduling

**Issue**: Some students never come to office hours, even when struggling
**Response**: Mid-semester check-in (Week 8) identifies at-risk students; I'll reach out proactively to invite them

**Issue**: Peer review quality may be uneven (some students give great feedback, others just go through motions)
**Response**: Eli analytics track helpfulness ratings; I'll follow up with students whose feedback is consistently rated unhelpful

**Issue**: Students may submit weak drafts to peer review (not taking it seriously)
**Response**: Completion-based grading for peer review submission means low-quality drafts still get 0 if peers can't review them; revision plan requires explaining what changes you'll make, which is hard if draft was truly weak

**Issue**: Email expectations may be culturally specific (some students from other educational systems have different communication norms)
**Response**: Frame email guidelines as "U.S. academic context conventions" rather than universal rules; provide grace for first offense; offer Writing Center as resource

### Competing Values

**Value tension**: **Accessibility vs. boundaries**
- Students need access to help when they need it
- Instructor needs work-life boundaries to be sustainable
- **Resolution**: Clear response times (24 hours) balance accessibility with boundaries; office hours offer intensive help without 24/7 availability

**Value tension**: **Peer feedback vs. expert feedback**
- Peer feedback is more timely and develops reviewer's skills
- Expert (instructor) feedback is more authoritative and detailed
- **Resolution**: Both are valuable; peer feedback is formative and frequent; instructor feedback is strategic and selective

**Value tension**: **Structure vs. flexibility**
- Firm deadlines teach accountability and enable synchronous collaboration
- Flexibility accommodates life circumstances and varying needs
- **Resolution**: Firm on peer review deadlines (where one person's lateness impacts others); flexible on email/office hours (individual communication)

**Value tension**: **Professional communication vs. accessibility**
- Teaching professional email norms is transferable skill
- Strict formality may intimidate students or create barriers
- **Resolution**: Professional but friendly (not stiff); explicit instruction lowers barrier; grace for learning curve

## Evidence & Iteration

### Evidence to Collect

**Communication effectiveness**:
- [ ] How many students come to office hours at least once? (Target: 75%+)
- [ ] Email response time tracking (am I meeting 24-hour commitment?)
- [ ] Student mid-semester survey: Are communication channels working for you?

**Peer review quality**:
- [ ] Eli analytics: Average helpfulness ratings across cycles (should improve over semester)
- [ ] Sample peer feedback: Does it follow Describe-Evaluate-Suggest framework?
- [ ] Revision plans: Are students substantively engaging with feedback or just summarizing?

**Feedback use**:
- [ ] Portfolio cover letters: Do students cite specific instructor/peer feedback that informed revision?
- [ ] Student interviews: Did you find feedback helpful? Why/why not?

**Equity indicators**:
- [ ] Office hours attendance by student demographics (are some groups under-represented?)
- [ ] Peer review participation rates (are some students consistently missing cycles?)
- [ ] Email communication patterns (are some students over-emailing due to confusion?)

### Revision Notes

**Based on piloting, consider adjusting:**

- **Office hours format**: If drop-in feels intimidating, switch to appointment-only (more structure, less anxiety)
- **Peer review timing**: If Week 3 first cycle is too early (students don't have enough to review), move to Week 4
- **Email examples**: If students still sending unclear emails after Week 1 practice, add more examples to policy
- **Feedback timing**: If one-week turnaround on reflective one-pagers isn't sustainable, communicate revised timeline early
- **Revision plan template**: If students struggle with "Which feedback will you use?", provide more structured prompts
