## Policy Statement

### Campus Safety is Shared Responsibility

Classroom and campus safety are paramount at Washington State University. This policy provides essential information about emergency procedures, but **you are responsible for familiarizing yourself with full WSU safety protocols**.

**Key principle**: **Alert, Assess, Act**
- **Alert**: Notice emergencies through direct observation or notification
- **Assess**: Evaluate your specific situation
- **Act**: Take the safest action for yourself and others

**Official WSU safety information**: https://oem.wsu.edu/

**Justification**: [[emergency-procedures-reasons-v101#Policy Rationale|University compliance]]

---

## Emergency Alert System

### Sign Up for Notifications

**WSU Alert:**
WSU sends emergency notifications via text, email, and phone for campus emergencies (active threats, severe weather, building evacuations, etc.).

**Sign up:**
1. Log in to myWSU
2. Go to "Emergency Alerts"
3. Verify your contact information
4. Add mobile number for text alerts

**Why this matters:**
In an emergency, you may not be in this classroom. Alerts reach you wherever you are on campus.

**Official signup**: https://alert.wsu.edu

**Justification**: [[emergency-procedures-reasons-v101#Alert System|Why enrollment matters]]

---

## Active Threat Response

### Run, Hide, Fight

WSU follows the **"Run, Hide, Fight"** protocol for active shooter incidents:

**1. RUN if you can**
- Escape if there's a safe path
- Leave belongings behind
- Help others if possible, but don't wait for them
- Call 911 when safe

**2. HIDE if you can't run**
- Lock and barricade doors
- Turn off lights and silence phones
- Hide behind large objects (desks, file cabinets)
- Stay quiet and still

**3. FIGHT as last resort**
- Only if your life is in immediate danger
- Act with aggression and improvised weapons
- Commit fully to incapacitating the threat

**In this classroom specifically:**
- Exit doors: [instructor will identify during Week 1]
- Best hiding spots: [instructor will identify during Week 1]
- Improvised barriers: desks, chairs

**Video and full protocol**: https://oem.wsu.edu/emergency-procedures/active-shooter/

**Justification**: [[emergency-procedures-reasons-v101#Active Threat|Preparedness reduces panic]]

## Building Evacuation

### When to Evacuate

**Fire alarm or evacuation order:**
- Leave immediately via nearest exit
- **Do not** use elevators
- **Do not** stop to gather belongings
- Assist those who need help if safe to do so

**Evacuation route from this classroom:**
- Primary exit: [instructor will identify during Week 1]
- Secondary exit (if primary blocked): [instructor will identify during Week 1]
- Assembly point: [instructor will identify during Week 1—typically 100+ feet from building]

**After evacuating:**
- Stay at assembly point until "all clear" given
- Do not re-enter building until authorities say it's safe
- Check on classmates—report anyone missing to first responders

**If you cannot evacuate** (wheelchair user, mobility impairment, injury):
- Go to nearest stairwell landing
- Call 911 and give your location
- Wait for rescue personnel
- Have a buddy system (classmate who will alert first responders to your location)

**Justification**: [[emergency-procedures-reasons-v101#Evacuation Protocol|Building-specific procedures]]

---

## Medical Emergency

### If Someone Needs Help

**Call 911 immediately if:**
- Loss of consciousness
- Chest pain or difficulty breathing
- Severe bleeding or injury
- Severe allergic reaction
- Suspected overdose or poisoning
- Mental health crisis with risk of harm

**What to tell dispatcher:**
- Location (building name, room number)
- Nature of emergency
- Condition of person (conscious? breathing?)
- Your contact information

**While waiting for help:**
- Do NOT move injured person unless immediate danger
- Send someone to meet first responders at building entrance

**For non-emergency medical issues:**
- Cougar Health Services: 509-335-3575
- 24/7 nurse line: 509-335-3575 (after hours)

**Justification**: [[emergency-procedures-reasons-v101#Medical Response|Life-threatening vs. urgent]]

## Severe Weather

### Tornado, Severe Storms, Extreme Cold

**Tornado warning** (tornado spotted or indicated on radar):
- Move to lowest floor of building

Pullman is in low seismic risk zone, but earthquakes can occur.
