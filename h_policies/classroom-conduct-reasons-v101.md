## Design Philosophy

### Core Pedagogical Principle

Classroom conduct policy should **create conditions for collaborative learning** rather than simply prohibit bad behavior. This course depends on peer review, shared writing, and intellectual risk-taking—all of which require psychological safety and mutual respect. The policy frames conduct expectations as **enabling learning**, not just maintaining order.

The policy addresses **both interpersonal dynamics** (respect, collaboration) and **institutional requirements** (discrimination/harassment policies, mandatory reporting). It emphasizes restorative rather than punitive approaches to minor disruptions while maintaining clear boundaries for serious misconduct.

### Theoretical Grounding

**Collaborative Learning Theory:**
- Learning happens through social interaction and dialogue
- Peer feedback more effective when based on trust and respect
- Students must feel safe to share imperfect writing and receive criticism

**Key Sources:**
- Bruffee [[@bruffee1984collb]], Kenneth. "Collaborative Learning and the 'Conversation of Mankind.'" *College English* 46.7 (1984): 635-652.
  - Learning as social process requiring conversational norms
- hooks, bell. *Teaching to Transgress: Education as the Practice of Freedom*. Routledge, 1994.
  - Classroom as community; mutual responsibility for learning environment

**Concepts Applied:**
- **Psychological safety**: Students more willing to take intellectual risks when they feel respected
- **Peer accountability**: Collaboration requires reliability and follow-through
- **Growth mindset**: Mistakes (including interpersonal ones) are learning opportunities

## Policy Rationale

### Purpose & Goals

**What this policy accomplishes:**
1. **Establishes norms** for respectful, productive interaction
2. **Supports collaboration**: Peer review and group work require trust
3. **Protects all students**: Discrimination and harassment prohibited
4. **Provides clarity**: Students know what's expected and what to do if problems arise
5. **Legal compliance**: Meets university requirements for non-discrimination and mandatory reporting

**Why emphasize collaboration:**
Course structure requires substantial peer interaction. Students can't opt out of collaboration, so policy must create conditions where collaboration works for everyone.

## Respectful Engagement

### Why These Standards

**"Respect for persons":**
- Basic dignity regardless of agreement/disagreement with ideas
- Distinguishes ad hominem attack from critique of argument
- Enables productive disagreement

**"Respect for diverse identities":**
- Composition of WSU student body increasingly diverse
- Writing classroom explores personal and cultural experiences
- Students must feel their identities honored, not erased or stereotyped

**"Respect for learning process":**
- Arriving late disrupts in-class writing and peer groups
- Not doing readings limits contribution to discussion
- Disengagement affects collaborative partners

**Research base:**
- Ambrose, Susan A., et al. *How Learning Works: Seven Research-Based Principles for Smart Teaching*. Jossey-Bass, 2010.
  - Principle #7: "Students' motivation determines, directs, and sustains what they do to learn" (climate affects motivation)

**Application:**
Policy creates climate where students feel their contributions valued, which increases motivation to engage.

## Collaborative Learning

### Why Collaboration Requires Explicit Norms

**Without norms, collaboration can fail:**
- Dominant students monopolize; quiet students withdraw
- Low-quality feedback wastes everyone's time ("Good job!")
- Unreliable partners create resentment and unequal labor

**With norms, collaboration succeeds:**
- "Be helpful" → specific, actionable feedback (Describe-Evaluate-Suggest)
- "Be reliable" → submit work on time so partners can review
- "Be generous" → share thinking process, not just final product

**Research base:**
- Johnson, David W., Roger T. Johnson, and Mary Beth Stanne. "Cooperative Learning Methods: A Meta-Analysis." University of Minnesota, 2000.
  - Collaborative learning effective when includes positive interdependence, individual accountability, and promotive interaction
  - Policy operationalizes these principles

**Why "helping others helps you":**
- Lundstrom & Baker (2009) research: Students learn more from giving feedback than receiving it
- Policy frames peer review as learning activity, not just service to others

---

## Participation Philosophy

### Why Balance Matters

**Problem with unbalanced participation:**
- Few students dominate → others disengage
- Everyone quiet → no collective thinking happens
- Some students speak thoughtlessly → wastes class time

**Policy encourages self-monitoring:**
- "If you tend to speak a lot, make space" → invites reflection from verbose students
- "If you tend to stay quiet, challenge yourself" → encourages quieter students without shaming

**Why "quality over quantity":**
- One substantive comment moves discussion forward
- Five superficial comments ("I agree," "Good point") add nothing
- Policy values depth, not just volume

**Research base:**
- Rocca, Kelly A. "Student Participation in the College Classroom." *Communication Education* 59.2 (2010): 185-213.
  - Effective participation requires both quality expectations and inclusive invitation

---

## Managing Disruption

### Graduated Response Approach

**Why start with informal address:**
- Most disruptions are unintentional (student doesn't realize they're loud, etc.)
- Informal conversation preserves relationship and dignity
- Gives student chance to self-correct

**When to escalate:**
- Repeated disruption after informal conversation
- Disruption affecting others' learning significantly
- Behavior that violates university conduct code (harassment, threats, etc.)

**Why not zero-tolerance:**
- Zero-tolerance policies (e.g., "one late arrival = kicked out") are punitive, not pedagogical
- Students deserve opportunity to explain and adjust
- Context matters (chronic lateness due to work schedule vs. disregard for class)

**Research base:**
- Restorative justice principles: Address harm, understand root causes, repair relationships
- Application: Minor conduct issues handled through conversation, not punishment

---

## University Compliance

### Legal and Ethical Obligations

**Mandatory reporting:**
- Title IX and WSU policy require faculty to report sexual harassment/misconduct
- Policy makes this clear so students can make informed decisions about disclosure
- Directs students to confidential resources if they want support without triggering report

**Non-discrimination:**
- ADA, Title VI, Title IX prohibit discrimination
- Policy affirms expectation that all identities respected
- Provides reporting channels if discrimination occurs

**Why explicit about protected characteristics:**
- Students may not know discrimination based on sexuality, gender identity, disability, religion, veteran status is illegal
- Naming characteristics makes clear what kinds of comments/behavior are prohibited

**Instructor's dual role:**
- Support students experiencing discrimination/harassment
- Report to appropriate offices (can't promise confidentiality except for confidential resources)

---

## Intellectual Risk-Taking

### Supporting Difficult Conversations

**Why writing courses address controversial topics:**
- Argument and persuasion inherently involve disagreement
- Students explore complex social/political issues through writing
- Critical thinking requires examining multiple perspectives, including uncomfortable ones

**Why guidelines matter:**
- "Critique ideas, not people" → prevents attacks on classmates
- "Assume complexity" → discourages reductive thinking
- "Stay grounded in evidence" → elevates discussion above opinion-shouting

**When to pause:**
- Discussion becomes personal attack
- Students experiencing trauma-related distress
- Conversation no longer productive (just repeating positions)

**Research base:**
- Brookfield, Stephen D., and Stephen Preskill. *Discussion as a Way of Teaching*. 2nd ed. Jossey-Bass, 2005.
  - Effective discussion requires ground rules, skilled facilitation, and awareness of power dynamics

**Application:**
Policy provides ground rules; instructor provides facilitation; policy acknowledges power dynamics (some topics affect people personally).

## Technology Use

### Why Allow Laptops Despite Distraction Risk?

**Pedagogical reasons:**
- In-class writing requires typing (faster, more fluent than handwriting for most)
- Peer review conducted in Eli (digital platform)
- Assignment sheets, readings accessible via Canvas

**Distraction risk:**
- Research shows laptops can distract both user and nearby students (Mueller & Oppenheimer, 2014)
- Multitasking reduces learning (Ophir, Nass, & Wagner, 2009)

**Why not ban laptops:**
- Course structure requires them for in-class writing
- Students with disabilities may need assistive technology
- Teaching students to manage technology attention is transferable skill

**Policy approach:**
- Permit laptops for course work
- Address misuse individually rather than blanket ban
- Frame as student responsibility to manage attention

**Research base:**
- Mueller, Pam A., and Daniel M. Oppenheimer. "The Pen Is Mightier Than the Keyboard." *Psychological Science* 25.6 (2014): 1159-1168.
  - Longhand notes lead to better conceptual understanding, but course requires digital writing

---

## Conflict Resolution

### Open Communication Approach

**Why encourage students to report concerns:**
- Instructor can't address problems they don't know about
- Early intervention prevents small issues from becoming major conflicts
- Students deserve support when experiencing harassment or discrimination

**Why confidentiality matters:**
- Student reporting peer's behavior doesn't want to be identified as "snitch"
- Instructor addresses issue without revealing source
- Protects reporting student from retaliation

**Why offer multiple pathways:**
- Some students comfortable talking to instructor
- Others prefer formal channels (OEO, Dean of Students)
- Confidential resources available for those who don't want reports made

**When informal resolution doesn't work:**
- Persistent disruption → may need Dean of Students involvement
- Harassment → may need OEO or Title IX investigation
- Instructor maintains records of conversations, patterns of behavior

---

## Implementation Approach

### Inclusive Design

**Accommodating different communication styles:**
- Introverts may prefer written reflection over verbal discussion
- Policy values both: online discussion forums, in-class participation, peer review
- "Participation" defined broadly (not just talking in class)

**Cultural differences:**
- Turn-taking norms vary across cultures
- Some cultures value deference to authority; others value challenging instructor
- Policy makes expectations explicit rather than assuming shared norms

**Neurodiversity:**
- Students with ADHD may struggle with sustained quiet focus
- Students with autism may find eye contact or social cues difficult
- DRS accommodations may include modified participation expectations

**Why model, not just state:**
- Students learn norms from instructor behavior more than policy text
- I model: thanking students for contributions, acknowledging good questions, respectfully disagreeing, admitting when I'm wrong

---

## Known Tensions

### Potential Issues

**Issue**: Student doesn't realize their behavior is disruptive (side conversations, laptop use)
**Response**: Quick, private word after class or email: "I noticed X; can we chat?" Frame as helping them succeed, not punishment.

**Issue**: Student feels peer feedback was harsh or unfair
**Response**: Validate concern, review feedback together, discuss what makes feedback helpful vs. harmful. Use as teaching moment for whole class (anonymized) if pattern emerges.

**Issue**: Discrimination occurs but student doesn't want to report formally
**Response**: Respect student's choice about formal reporting while still addressing behavior. Can address generally with class ("I've noticed some comments that aren't respectful") without identifying specific incident.

**Issue**: Student claims conduct policy restricts their free speech
**Response**: Clarify difference between free speech (legal concept protecting speech from government censorship) and classroom norms (pedagogical standards for productive learning). Policy doesn't prohibit expressing unpopular views; it requires expressing them respectfully with evidence.

## Evidence & Iteration

### Evidence to Collect

**Classroom climate**:
- [ ] Mid-semester survey: Do students feel respected? Safe sharing writing? Comfortable disagreeing?
- [ ] Peer review helpfulness ratings: Are students giving constructive feedback?
- [ ] Office hours visits: Are students bringing concerns about classroom dynamics?

**Participation patterns**:
- [ ] Who's contributing to discussions (tracking for patterns of exclusion/dominance)?
- [ ] Are online discussion forums more inclusive than in-class discussion?

**Conflict/disruption**:
- [ ] How many conduct conversations needed?
- [ ] What issues most common (lateness, technology distraction, disrespect)?
- [ ] Were interventions effective (behavior changed)?

### Revision Notes

**Based on piloting, consider adjusting:**
- **Participation expectations**: If introverted students still struggling, add more written reflection options
- **Technology policy**: If laptop distraction widespread, consider designated "laptop-free" portions of class
- **Conflict resolution**: If students not reporting concerns, emphasize confidentiality more strongly
- **Difficult topics**: If discussions regularly become heated, add more structured protocols (fishbowl, think-pair-share)
