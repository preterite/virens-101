## Design Philosophy

### Core Pedagogical Principle

The grading system must reward **sustained engagement with writing processes** while recognizing that both **writing-as-verb (labor/process)** and **writing-as-noun (capital/product)** have value. Students should be incentivized to:

1. **Accumulate textual capital** through daily writing practice
2. **Engage meaningfully with feedback** from peers and instructor
3. **Revise substantively** rather than superficially
4. **Document their processes** for metacognitive growth
5. **Produce polished work** that demonstrates course outcomes

The grading structure operationalizes the course's rejection of episodic "big assignment" thinking in favor of accumulative, recursive writing practices.

### Theoretical Grounding

**Key Sources:**
- Elbow, Peter. "Ranking, Evaluating, and Liking: Sorting Out Three Forms of Judgment." *College English* 55.2 (1993): 187-206.
- Inoue, Asao B. *Labor-Based Grading Contracts: Building Equity and Inclusion in the Compassionate Writing Classroom*. WAC Clearinghouse, 2019.

- Broad, Bob. *What We Really Value: Beyond Rubrics in Teaching and Assessing Writing*. Utah State UP, 2003.

**Concepts Applied:**
- **Portfolio assessment** as holistic evaluation that honors revision and growth
- **Labor-based grading** principles that reward engagement while maintaining quality standards
- **Completion-based formative assessment** to reduce grading burden and anxiety while valuing process
- **Metacognitive reflection** as evidence of learning and transfer potential

---

## Policy Rationale

### Purpose & Goals

This grading policy addresses several challenges common in first-year composition:

**Challenge 1: Students view grades as rewards for compliance rather than evidence of learning**
- **Solution:** Portfolio (50%) assesses learning outcomes holistically; formative work (50%) rewards engagement

**Challenge 2: Traditional assignment-based grading creates episodic thinking**
- **Solution:** Fragment accumulation (15%) and ongoing process documentation (10%) value continuous work

**Challenge 3: Students don't revise meaningfully because revision isn't explicitly rewarded**
- **Solution:** Revision & Feedback component (20%) specifically rewards engaging with and responding to feedback

**Challenge 4: Late work in accelerated cycles disrupts peer review and feedback**
- **Solution:** Graduated late penalties (20%/30%/50%) incentivize timeliness while allowing recovery

**Challenge 5: Attendance matters in process-based courses but universities limit penalties**
- **Solution:** Daily quizzes with built-in forgiveness (lowest 10 dropped = 1.5 weeks free absences)

### Pedagogical Philosophy

The grading structure embodies three principles:

**1. Value both process and product**
- Formative work (50%) assesses process, labor, engagement
- Portfolio (50%) assesses product, outcomes, transfer potential
- Neither alone tells the full story of student learning

**2. Make expectations explicit and achievable**
- Completion criteria are clear (150+ words, claim + evidence, cites feedback)
- Grade ranges are explicitly tied to behaviors ("complete all work on time" = B-range)
- Multiple opportunities to demonstrate learning (fragments, peer review, reflections, portfolio)

**3. Build in forgiveness while maintaining standards**
- Dropped quizzes (10 of 40) = grace for life events
- Late work accepted with penalties (not rejected outright)
- Portfolio can showcase growth even if earlier work was weak
- But: peer review deadlines are hard (synchronous dependency), portfolio must meet threshold

---

## Grading Options Considered

### Option A: Split Portfolio Model

**Structure:**
- Portfolio: 50% (Polished 30%, Process 10%, Cover letter 10%)
- Formative: 50% (Fragments 15%, Peer review 15%, Quizzes 10%, Reflections 10%)

**Pros:**
- Explicitly splits process and product within portfolio
- Significant weight on peer review (15%)
- Built-in forgiveness via dropped quizzes

**Cons:**
- Doesn't explicitly reward revision as distinct from accumulation
- Students could hit fragment target with low quality, panic-revise for portfolio
- No mechanism to reward "used feedback well"

**Rejected because:** Doesn't explicitly incentivize revision

---

### Option B: Milestone + Portfolio Model

**Structure:**
- Portfolio: 50%
- Movement Milestones: 30% (M1, M2, M3 checkpoints at 10% each)
- Ongoing Participation: 20% (Peer review 10%, Quizzes 10%)

**Pros:**
- Forces revision at regular intervals
- Matches four-Movement pedagogical structure
- Students get formative grades predicting portfolio success

**Cons:**
- Three milestone grades feel like "assignments" (contradicts accumulation model)
- Might recreate episodic structure we're trying to avoid
- Students might game it: "I'll skip M1, catch up later"

**Rejected because:** Reintroduces episodic thinking through milestones

---

### Option C: Feedback-Responsive Revision Model

**Structure:**
- Portfolio: 50%
- Peer Review + Responsive Revision: 25% (Eli 10%, Documented revision 15%)
- Fragment Accumulation: 10%
- Process Documentation: 10%
- Attendance: 5%

**Pros:**
- Explicitly rewards using feedback to revise (15% for documented revision)
- Separates "made fragments" (10%) from "improved them via feedback" (15%)
- Process documentation gets its own category
- Highest weight on activities that produce learning

**Cons:**
- "Documented revision cycles" might be unclear to students initially
- Requires careful grading of reflective one-pagers
- Fragment accumulation might feel under-weighted at only 10%

**Rejected because:** Fragment accumulation under-weighted given course emphasis on building corpus

---

### Option D: Labor-Based with Quality Checkpoints

**Structure:**
- Portfolio: 50% (threshold standards for each outcome)
- Labor Completion: 40% (Fragments 15%, Peer review 10%, Process docs 10%, Quizzes 5%)
- Metacognitive Reflection: 10% (Four reflective one-pagers at 2.5% each)

**Pros:**
- Values labor (doing the work) heavily
- Fragment accumulation well-weighted (15%)
- Completion-based grading reduces burden
- Reflective one-pagers as separate category

**Cons:**
- Labor-based doesn't explicitly reward revision quality
- Students might accumulate junk fragments if only completion counts
- Portfolio becomes high-stakes if pass/fail threshold

**Rejected because:** Doesn't sufficiently balance labor with quality

---

### Option E: Hybrid Points + Completion Model (SELECTED)

**Structure:**
- Portfolio: 50%
- Formative: 50%
  - Fragment Accumulation: 15% (Completion 12%, Quality baseline 3%)
  - Revision + Feedback: 20% (Peer review 10%, Reflective one-pagers 10%)
  - Process Documentation: 10%
  - Attendance/Participation: 5%

**Pros:**
- **Balances accumulation (15%) with revision incentive (20%)**
- Reflective one-pagers explicitly reward citing feedback and showing revisions
- Peer review weighted significantly (10%)
- Completion-based where appropriate (reduces burden)
- Built-in forgiveness via dropped quizzes
- 70% of non-portfolio grade under student control

**Selected because:**
1. Honors course's dual emphasis on accumulation AND revision
2. Reflective one-pagers are linchpin: force metacognition, reward engagement with feedback, prepare portfolio
3. Fragment quality baseline (3%) prevents "junk accumulation" while keeping most credit completion-based
4. Grade distribution targets 82-87% for "complete everything competently" students (splits difference between instructor's 79-84% tendency and department's 81-86% norm)

---

## Stress-Test Analysis

To verify Option E's robustness, we tested five student scenarios:

### Scenario Matrix

| Student Type | Expected Grade Range | Rationale |
|-------------|---------------------|-----------|
| **Good Student** (completes all, quality varies) | 85-95% (B to A) | Gets most formative points (45-49%), portfolio quality determines final grade |
| **No-Show** (misses 4-6 weeks, late catch-up) | 55-70% (F to C-) | Loses quiz points, late penalties on fragments, misses peer review cycles |
| **Check-Box** (attends, minimal engagement) | 72-82% (C- to B-) | Gets completion points but low portfolio/reflection scores |
| **Game-System** (exploits loopholes) | 70-85% (C- to B) | Can hit targets but struggles with quality baseline and reflective one-pagers |
| **Overachiever** (high volume, variable quality) | 85-98% (B to A+) | Volume gets accumulation points, but portfolio determines if truly exceptional |

### Key Insights from Stress-Test

**Strengths:**
- Good students who engage thoughtfully land in B to A range (appropriate)
- No-show students struggle significantly (peer review deadlines create hard floor)
- System rewards engagement more than gaming

**Vulnerabilities:**
- Overachiever scenario: volume could override quality if quality baseline (3%) not rigorously enforced
- Game-system scenario: savvy students might hit all targets with minimal engagement

**Mitigation:**
- Fragment quality baseline must be meaningfully enforced (spot-check for claim + evidence, genuine engagement)
- Reflective one-pagers must require specific citation of feedback received and revisions made (not generic reflection)
- Portfolio holistic assessment includes conventions and polish, not just process evidence

## Grade Distribution Calibration

### Target Distribution

**Goal:** Center grades at 82-87% (B- to B+) for students who complete all work with reasonable quality

**Rationale:**
- Departmental norm: 81-86% (B- to B+)
- Instructor's typical distribution: 79-84% (C+ to B)
- Compromise: Target 82-87% rewards engagement while maintaining standards

### How the Math Works

**Check-box student (minimal engagement):**
- Fragments: 12 + 1 = 13% (hits target, minimal quality)
- Peer review: 7% (completes but unhelpful)
- Reflections: 5% (generic, doesn't cite feedback)
- Process docs: 10% (completion only)
- Quizzes: 5%
- **Formative total: 40%**
- Portfolio: 32% (64% quality = D-level portfolio)
- **Final grade: 72% (C-)**

**Complete-competently student:**
- Fragments: 12 + 3 = 15% (target + quality)
- Peer review: 10% (helpful feedback)
- Reflections: 9% (cites feedback, shows revision)
- Process docs: 10%
- Quizzes: 5%
- **Formative total: 49%**
- Portfolio: 38% (76% quality = C-level portfolio)
- **Final grade: 87% (B+)**

**Exceptional student:**
- Formative: 50% (full credit)
- Portfolio: 45% (90% quality = A-level portfolio)
- **Final grade: 95% (A)**

This calibration ensures B-range is achievable for students who engage consistently and produce competent work.

---

## Implementation Approach

### Communication Strategy

**Week 1:**
- Full grading breakdown in syllabus
- Class discussion of how formative/portfolio split works
- Emphasize that B-range is expected for "complete all work competently"

**Ongoing:**
- Canvas gradebook updated after each major component
- Visual progress trackers (fragment count, peer review completion)
- Individual check-ins during office hours

**Week 8:**
- Mid-semester grade reports
- Identify students at risk
- Discuss portfolio planning

### Enforcement Philosophy

**Completion-based components (strict but fair):**
- Fragment target: Either you reach 40-50 or you don't
- Peer review: Either you complete the cycle or you don't (hard deadlines)
- Process docs: Either you write workflow logs 2×/week or you don't

**Quality-assessed components (holistic, standards-based):**
- Fragment quality baseline: Spot-check for genuine engagement
- Reflective one-pagers: Must cite specific feedback and show specific revisions
- Portfolio: Holistic rubric across all seven outcomes

**Late work (graduated penalties to incentivize timeliness):**
- 20% penalty < 1 week: Mild deterrent, allows catch-up
- 30% penalty 1-2 weeks: Stronger deterrent
- 50% penalty > 2 weeks: Significant but not complete loss

### Equity Considerations

**Built-in flexibility:**
- 10 dropped quizzes = 1.5 weeks grace for illness, emergencies, life events
- Late work accepted (with penalties) rather than rejected
- Portfolio can showcase growth even if earlier work was weak

**Potential inequities:**
- Daily quizzes require physical presence (disadvantages students with transportation/childcare issues)
  - Mitigation: Generous drop policy, DRS accommodations
- Eli Review cycles have hard deadlines (disadvantages students with unpredictable schedules)
  - Mitigation: Clear advance notice of all peer review dates, can still pass without perfect peer review record
- Fragment accumulation assumes consistent access to technology
  - Mitigation: Index cards as analog option, campus computer labs available

## Theoretical Grounding

### Research Base

**Portfolio Assessment:**
- Yancey, Kathleen Blake. "Postmodernism, Palimpsest, and Portfolios: Theoretical Issues in the Representation of Student Work." *College Composition and Communication* 55.4 (2004): 738-761.
  - **Principle:** Portfolios represent learning-over-time, not performance-at-moment
  - **Application:** 50% of grade from portfolio assessed at semester's end allows growth

**Labor-Based Grading:**
- Inoue, Asao B. *Labor-Based Grading Contracts*. WAC Clearinghouse, 2019.
  - **Principle:** Labor itself has value; grading should acknowledge effort and engagement
  - **Application:** Formative work (50%) largely completion-based with quality gates

**Metacognition and Transfer:**
- Yancey, Robertson, and Taczak. *Writing Across Contexts: Transfer, Composition, and Sites of Writing*. Utah State UP, 2014.
  - **Principle:** Metacognitive reflection supports transfer of learning
  - **Application:** Reflective one-pagers (10%) prepare students for transfer by making learning explicit

**Revision Pedagogy:**
- Sommers, Nancy. "Revision Strategies of Student Writers and Experienced Adult Writers." *College Composition and Communication* 31.4 (1980): 378-388.
  - **Principle:** Meaningful revision requires more than surface-level changes
  - **Application:** Reflective one-pagers must cite specific feedback received and revisions made

## Known Tensions

### Potential Issues

**Issue 1: "I completed everything but got a C"**
- **Cause:** Portfolio was low-quality despite completing formative work
- **Response:** Formative work is 50%; portfolio is other 50%. Completion ≠ mastery. Portfolio must demonstrate outcomes.

**Issue 2: "My peer reviews were helpful but I got marked down"**
- **Cause:** Eli Review helpfulness metrics are algorithmic
- **Response:** Explain that "helpful" means substantive, specific, actionable. Generic praise ("good job!") scores low.

**Issue 3: "I accumulated 50 fragments but they're all low-quality"**
- **Cause:** Student gamed the completion system
- **Response:** Quality baseline (3%) is for this scenario. Instructor spot-checks; junk fragments don't count toward target.

**Issue 4: "Late penalties are too harsh"**
- **Cause:** Student perspective that work completed = work that should get full credit
- **Response:** Late work in accelerated cycles misses feedback opportunities. Penalties reflect real costs.

**Issue 5: "Why is peer review so heavily weighted?"**
- **Cause:** 10% seems high for "just reading others' work"
- **Response:** Peer review is where learning happens. Reading critically, providing feedback, and receiving feedback are all essential composing processes.

### Competing Values

**Rigor vs. Forgiveness:**
- Tension: Hard deadlines (peer review) vs. acceptance of late work (fragments)
- Resolution: Synchronous activities (peer review) have hard deadlines; asynchronous activities (fragments, reflections) accept late work with penalties

**Process vs. Product:**
- Tension: 50% portfolio seems product-focused in process-oriented course
- Resolution: Portfolio includes process evidence (drafts, logs, maps). Product assessment honors that process produces capital.

**Completion vs. Quality:**
- Tension: Completion-based grading could reward volume over substance
- Resolution: Quality baseline (3%), reflective one-pagers requiring cited feedback, and holistic portfolio assessment prevent gaming

## Evidence & Iteration

### Evidence to Collect

- [x] Mid-semester grade distributions: Are students clustered in B-range as expected?
- [x] Portfolio quality vs. formative scores: Do high formative scores predict high portfolio scores?
- [x] Fragment quality spot-checks: Are students meeting 150+ word, claim + evidence minimum?
- [x] Reflective one-pager analysis: Are students citing specific feedback and showing specific revisions?
- [x] Late work patterns: Are penalties effective deterrent or just punitive?
- [x] Student feedback: Anonymous mid-semester survey on grading clarity and fairness

### Revision Notes

**After pilot semester:**
- Adjust fragment target if 40-50 proves too ambitious or too easy
- Revise late penalties if patterns show they're ineffective or overly punitive
- Consider whether quality baseline (3%) needs clearer criteria or stronger enforcement
- Evaluate whether reflective one-pagers at 2.5% each provide sufficient incentive for quality

**Potential modifications:**
- Increase fragment quality baseline to 5% if volume-over-quality gaming persists
- Decrease late penalties to 15%/25%/40% if current penalties discourage risk-taking
- Add "revision evidence" requirement to portfolio to further incentivize engagement with feedback
