## Policy Statement

### Technology in This Course

This course uses technology intentionally to support learning, but **technology is a tool, not the point**. You'll use digital tools for writing, peer review, organization, and process documentation—all of which support the course's focus on accumulation, iteration, and reflection.

**Required tech:** Index cards (analog!), Microsoft OneDrive/Word, Zotero, Eli Review, Canvas  
**Optional tech:** Laptops/tablets for in-class writing  
**Total cost:** Approximately $30-35 for semester

**Justification**: [[technology-use-reasons-v101#Policy Rationale|Why this tech stack]]

---

## Required Tools and Platforms

### What You Must Use

**1. Index cards (3x5 or 4x6)**
- **Cost**: $3-5 for semester supply
- **Use**: Analog fragment writing, sorting, constraint experiments
- **Why**: Tactile, portable, forces concision, makes connections visual
- **Where to buy**: WSU Bookie, any office supply store

**2. Microsoft OneDrive and Word**
- **Cost**: Free with WSU student account
- **Use**: Digital fragment writing, collaborative drafting, portfolio assembly
- **Why**: Cloud sync, real-time collaboration, accessible from any device
- **Setup**: Log in with WSU credentials at https://portal.office.com

**3. Zotero (citation manager)**
- **Cost**: Free (core software); $20/year for storage upgrade (optional)
- **Use**: Managing sources, generating citations, organizing research
- **Why**: Industry-standard tool; transferable skill for future courses
- **Setup**: Download from https://www.zotero.org

**4. Eli Review (peer feedback platform)**
- **Cost**: $10 access code for semester
- **Use**: Submitting drafts, giving/receiving peer feedback, revision planning
- **Why**: Structured peer review with analytics; asynchronous flexibility
- **Purchase**: Via Canvas link (provided Week 1)

**5. Canvas (LMS)**
- **Cost**: Free
- **Use**: Accessing readings, assignment sheets, submitting work, discussion forums
- **Why**: WSU's official LMS; all materials posted here
- **Access**: https://canvas.wsu.edu

**Total required cost**: ~$15-20 (index cards + Eli) or ~$30-35 (if you upgrade Zotero storage)

**Justification**: [[technology-use-reasons-v101#Tool Selection|Why these specific tools]]

---

## Classroom Technology Use

### Laptops and Tablets

**In-class use is permitted (and encouraged) for:**
- In-class writing activities
- Taking notes on readings/discussions
- Accessing Canvas for assignment sheets
- Peer review in Eli
- Workflow log entries
- Reference materials (online dictionaries, Zotero library)

**Not permitted during class:**
- Social media (unless it's part of a specific course activity)
- Shopping, gaming, entertainment
- Work for other courses
- Messaging unrelated to class

**Why the distinction:**
This course does most writing in class, so laptops/tablets support learning. But distracted device use hurts both you and those around you (research shows it's contagious).

**Justification**: [[technology-use-reasons-v101#Classroom Device Policy|Research on laptops and learning]]

---

## Managing Technology Attention

### Digital Distraction is Real

**Research shows:**
- Multitasking reduces learning and retention
- Laptops can distract both user and nearby students
- Notifications fragment attention

**Strategies for success:**

**Before class:**
- Close unnecessary tabs/apps
- Turn off notifications (or use "Do Not Disturb")
- Prepare your digital workspace (Canvas open, Word ready, etc.)

**During class:**
- Use full-screen mode for writing tasks to minimize distractions
- Keep phone in bag (not on desk) unless using for specific activity
- If you get distracted, close the distraction and refocus—don't spiral

**If you're struggling:**
- Try analog writing (index cards, paper notebook) for in-class work
- Sit away from outlets if dead battery forces you to focus
- Talk to me about strategies—I'm here to help

**Justification**: [[technology-use-reasons-v101#Attention Management|Why attention matters]]

---

## Phones in Class

### Basic Expectations

**Phones should be:**
- Silenced or on vibrate
- Put away (in bag or pocket, not on desk)
- Used only for emergencies or specific course activities

**Appropriate phone use during class:**
- Quick reference (dictionary, thesaurus, search)
- Timer for timed writing exercises
- Photo of whiteboard notes (if you ask first)
- Emergency call/text (step outside to take it)

**Not appropriate:**
- Scrolling social media
- Texting friends
- Shopping or browsing
- Gaming

**If your phone is a tool you need:**
Some students use phones for accessibility (screen readers, assistive apps) or to manage ADHD (timers, reminders). That's fine—just let me know so I understand.

**Justification**: [[technology-use-reasons-v101#Phone Policy|Why put phones away]]

---

- Video recording requires everyone's permission (ask before recording faces)

**Why permission matters:**
- Students should feel safe sharing ideas without fear of public exposure
- Federal law (FERPA) protects student privacy
- Unauthorized recording can be academic misconduct

**If you need recordings for accommodations:**
- DRS can arrange official note-taker or recording permission
- This ensures accommodation while protecting privacy

**Justification**: [[technology-use-reasons-v101#Recording Privacy|Legal and ethical boundaries]]

## Common Questions

**Q: Do I have to bring my laptop to every class?**
**A:** Not required, but helpful. You can use index cards for in-class writing and type up fragments later. Most students prefer having laptops for in-class work.

**Q: Can I use Google Docs instead of Word?**
**A:** For personal notes, yes. For submitted work and portfolio, no—OneDrive/Word required for collaboration features and compatibility.

**Q: What if I prefer handwriting to typing?**
**A:** Totally fine! Write on index cards or paper, then type up for submission. Process documentation can include photos of handwritten work.

**Q: I already know how to use Zotero. Do I still have to attend the workshop?**
**A:** No, but verify your setup works for MLA citation style (we'll use MLA in this course). Attend if you want refresher.
