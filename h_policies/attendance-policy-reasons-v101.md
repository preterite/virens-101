## Design Philosophy

### Core Pedagogical Principle

Attendance policies should **support learning rather than police compliance**. This policy treats attendance as interconnected with the course's central pedagogical commitments: in-class collaborative writing, iterative revision through peer feedback, and process documentation. The quiz-based approach **verifies both presence and engagement** while building in substantial forgiveness for life's unpredictability.

The course's **flipped classroom model** (writing in class, reading at home) makes attendance functionally different from lecture-based courses. Missing class doesn't just mean missing content delivery—it means **missing opportunities to write, to receive peer feedback, and to participate in collaborative knowledge-building**. The attendance policy acknowledges this without punishing students for circumstances beyond their control.

### Theoretical Grounding

**Attendance and Learning:**
- Traditional attendance policies assume correlation between physical presence and learning
- Research shows engagement matters more than mere presence
- This policy attempts to verify engagement (via exit ticket reflection) rather than just presence

**Key Sources:**
- Credé, Marcus, Sylvia G. Roch, and Urszula M. Kieszczynka. "Class Attendance in College: A Meta-Analytic Review of the Relationship of Class Attendance with Grades and Student Characteristics." *Review of Educational Research* 80.2 (2010): 272-295.
  - Attendance correlates with grades, but relationship is complex and mediated by engagement
- Friedman, Paul, Fred Rodriguez, and Joe McComb. "Why Students Do and Do Not Attend Classes." *College Teaching* 49.4 (2001): 124-133.
  - Students make strategic decisions about attendance based on perceived value and competing demands

**Concepts Applied:**
- **Process over product**: Quiz exit ticket asks for reflection on learning process, not content regurgitation
- **Formative engagement**: Attendance policy part of formative assessment structure, not punitive
- **Equity and flexibility**: Generous forgiveness policy acknowledges different student circumstances
- **Collaborative dependency**: Peer review structure makes attendance affect others, not just individual

## Policy Rationale

### Purpose & Goals

**What student behavior/learning does this policy support:**
1. **Regular attendance**: 10-quiz buffer incentivizes consistent attendance while allowing flexibility
2. **Engaged participation**: Exit ticket question prompts metacognitive reflection on daily learning
3. **Responsibility and planning**: Students learn to manage their grace period strategically
4. **Professional habits**: Showing up reliably is transferable workplace skill

**What this policy prevents:**
1. **Excessive absences disrupting learning**: Beyond 10 absences, students miss too much collaborative work to succeed
2. **Grade penalty for minor illnesses**: Grace period accommodates routine sickness without documentation burden
3. **Punishing students for circumstances beyond control**: Flexible forgiveness vs. rigid threshold

**What this policy acknowledges:**
1. **Students have complex lives**: Jobs, family obligations, health issues, mental health needs
2. **Not all absences are equal**: Missing peer review day has different impact than missing lecture
3. **Presence ≠ engagement**: Can be physically present but mentally absent; quiz verifies both

### Pedagogical Philosophy

**Alignment with course values:**

| VIRENS Principle | Attendance Policy Application |
|-----------------|-------------------------------|
| **Process documentation** | Exit ticket question documents what students noticed/learned |
| **Failure-as-diagnostic** | Absences signal need for support, not moral failure |
| **Iteration and revision** | Regular attendance enables iterative peer review cycles |
| **Collaborative labor** | Peer review dependency makes attendance matter to others |
| **Accumulation over episodes** | Consistent attendance supports fragment accumulation |

**Why quizzes instead of attendance sheets:**

**Attendance sheets verify presence only:**
- Instructor calls roll or passes sign-in sheet
- Students physically present but may be mentally absent
- No verification that students engaged with class content or activities

**Quizzes verify presence + engagement:**
- Word of the day confirms presence (can't get it without being there)
- Exit ticket confirms engagement (requires reflection on class activities)
- Provides instructor with formative feedback on what resonated/confused students

**Additional benefits of quiz approach:**
- Canvas automatically tracks and calculates (less instructor labor)
- Students can monitor their own attendance in gradebook
- Exit ticket data helps instructor adjust future classes based on what was "muddy"

## Quiz Design

### Why This Format?

**Question 1: Word of the Day**
- **Purpose**: Verify physical presence at start of class
- **Why simple**: Low-stakes, quick, accessible to all students
- **Why displayed at start**: Prevents students from skipping first 30 minutes
- **Why displayed for 10-15 min**: Accommodates slight lateness without penalty

**Question 2: Exit Ticket Reflection**
- **Purpose**: Verify engagement with class activities and prompt metacognition
- **Why "Memorable, Muddy, or More"**: Three-option frame provides structure while allowing authentic reflection
- **Why open-ended**: Students write in own words rather than multiple-choice (deeper engagement)
- **Instructor benefit**: Exit tickets reveal what concepts are unclear or what activities were most effective

**Why both questions:**
Presence without engagement = wasted time
Engagement without presence = impossible in flipped classroom model

**Research base:**
- Hattie, John. "The Applicability of Visible Learning to Higher Education." *Scholarship of Teaching and Learning in Psychology* 1.1 (2015): 79-91.
  - Feedback to teachers about what students are learning improves instruction
- Angelo, Thomas A., and K. Patricia Cross. *Classroom Assessment Techniques: A Handbook for College Teachers*. 2nd ed. Jossey-Bass, 1993.
  - "Muddiest point" exit tickets reveal where instruction needs clarification

### Why Quiz Stays Open All Class?

**Accommodates different engagement patterns:**
- Some students work better by completing quiz immediately
- Others prefer to reflect at end of class when they've seen full picture
- Students who arrive late can still complete

**Prevents disruption:**
- No "everybody stop and take quiz now" moment
- Students complete asynchronously as works for their process

**Equity consideration:**
- Students with ADHD or executive function challenges may need flexibility in when they complete
- Students who arrive late (bus, childcare) not automatically penalized

---

## Forgiveness Policy

### Why 10 Dropped Quizzes?

**Calculation:**
- 40 quizzes across 15-week semester
- 10 dropped quizzes = 25% forgiveness
- Equivalent to **1.5 weeks of absences** (approximately 4.5 class meetings in 3x/week schedule)

**Why 1.5 weeks:**
- WSU Academic Regulation 72 historically allowed "two weeks of free absences, no questions asked"
- 1.5 weeks balances flexibility with attendance necessity for collaborative course
- More generous than typical courses (which often allow 3-4 absences total)

**Why automatic drop (not choice):**
- Students don't have to track which absences to "use"
- System automatically drops lowest 10 at end of semester
- Reduces administrative burden (no "can I drop quiz #7?" emails)

**Research base:**
- Tough, Paul. *The Years That Matter Most: How College Makes or Breaks Us*. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2019.
  - Low-income and first-generation students face more life disruptions; generous attendance policies increase equity
- Kuh, George D., et al. *Student Success in College: Creating Conditions That Matter*. Jossey-Bass, 2005.
  - Flexibility in policies correlates with higher retention for at-risk students

### Why No Arbitrary "After X Absences, You Fail"?

**Rejected approaches:**

**Hard threshold (e.g., "4 unexcused absences = automatic F"):**
- **Problem**: Punitive rather than pedagogical
- **Problem**: Doesn't account for when absences occur or what's missed
- **Problem**: Single crisis can doom a student (car accident, family emergency)

**Percentage-based (e.g., "miss 20% of classes = fail"):**
- **Problem**: Still arbitrary
- **Problem**: Treats all absences as equal (missing peer review ≠ missing lecture)

**This course's approach:**
- **Graduated consequences**: 1-10 absences = grace period (no penalty)
- **11+ absences**: Grade affected through lower quiz points, but not automatic failure
- **Indirect effects**: Missing class affects fragment accumulation, peer review quality, learning
- **Crisis support**: Extended absences addressed individually with incomplete/withdrawal options

**Pedagogical rationale:**
Students deserve opportunity to recover from crisis without automatic course failure. The real consequence of excessive absences is missed learning, which will show in portfolio quality.

---

## Peer Review Dependency

### Why Latecomer Groups?

**Logistical reality:**
Peer review cycles require synchronous participation. When Student A misses the draft submission deadline, Students B, C, and D have nothing to review.

**Options considered:**

**Option A: Zero credit for missed cycle**
- **Rejected**: Too punitive; single absence shouldn't tank grade
- Doesn't solve logistical problem (peers still have no draft to review)

**Option B: Allow make-up reviews**
- **Rejected**: Disrupts cycle timing; creates instructor labor to manually reassign
- Unfair to students who submitted on time (their reviews less useful if delayed)

**Option C: Latecomer groups (selected)**
- **How it works**: Students who miss deadline are grouped together for that cycle
- **Natural consequence**: Late submissions → rushed reviews → lower quality feedback
- **Not punitive**: Students still receive credit for participation
- **Educational**: Students learn that collaborative work has different stakes than individual work

**Historical evidence:**
In previous semesters, latecomer groups consistently receive lower "helpfulness" ratings on peer feedback because:
1. Reviewers wrote drafts hastily (less thoughtful work to review)
2. Reviewers had less time to give feedback (cycle already compressed)
3. Writers receive fewer suggestions (rushed peers = minimal feedback)

This is not an imposed penalty—it's the natural consequence of missing collaborative deadlines.

**Research base:**
- Bruffee [[@bruffee1984collb]], Kenneth. "Collaborative Learning and the 'Conversation of Mankind.'" *College English* 46.7 (1984): 635-652.
  - Collaborative learning depends on mutual accountability; one person's absence affects group

### Why Firm Peer Review Deadlines?

**Pedagogical rationale:**
- Writing-to-learn happens through cycles: draft → feedback → revision
- Delaying one cycle compresses time for next iteration
- Course design requires 6 peer review cycles; missing any reduces total feedback opportunities

**Professional development:**
- In workplace, missing collaborative deadlines affects team
- Learning to meet deadlines when others depend on you is transferable skill

**Equity consideration:**
- Clear advance notice (at least one week before each cycle)
- Eli Review platform accessible from anywhere (students don't have to attend class to submit)
- Extensions possible for documented emergencies, but must be requested in advance

---

## Excused Absences

### University Policy Compliance

WSU policies require accommodation for:
- **Military service**: Federal law (USERRA) requires accommodation
- **Religious observances**: State and university policy mandates reasonable accommodation
- **Official university activities**: Athletics, debate, academic conferences require Class Absence Request

**This course complies** while minimizing documentation burden:
- Students notify instructor within first two weeks (religious observances)
- Class Absence Request form required for university activities (standard process)
- Alternative arrangements made for missed work

### Why Documentation Only for Extended Absences?

**Routine absences (1-10)**: Covered by drop policy, no documentation needed
- **Pedagogical reason**: Reduces surveillance; treats students as adults
- **Equity reason**: Low-income students may lack access to medical care for documentation
- **Practical reason**: Reduces instructor labor verifying minor absences

**Extended absences (11+)**: Documentation may be required
- **Pedagogical reason**: Verifies legitimate crisis vs. chronic disengagement
- **Equity reason**: Documentation triggers additional support (Dean of Students, DRS, CAPS)
- **Practical reason**: University may require documentation for incomplete or withdrawal

**Research base:**
- Slade, Catherine, Keith Trigwell, and Denise Chalmers. "Building Presence in a Blended Learning Environment." *Journal of Educational Media* 28.1 (2003): 37-49.
  - Trust-based attendance policies (vs. surveillance) correlate with higher engagement

---

## Deadline Policy

### Why Absences Don't Extend Deadlines

**Pedagogical reasons:**
1. **Collaborative dependencies**: If Student A gets extension because of absence, but Student B's peer review depends on Student A's draft, cascade effect ensues
2. **Process-based learning**: Course design assumes consistent accumulation; delaying work disrupts iterative cycles
3. **Professional development**: In workplace, deadlines often inflexible; learning to work ahead when absences foreseeable is valuable skill

**Practical reasons:**
1. **Instructor capacity**: Individualized deadline extensions for 24 students = unsustainable tracking
2. **Fairness**: Students who attend despite challenges (work, childcare) shouldn't be disadvantaged vs. students who skip and get extensions

**Exceptions:**
1. **Documented emergencies**: Extended illness, family crisis, etc. can warrant extensions
2. **DRS accommodations**: May include modified deadlines as part of accommodation plan
3. **Pre-arranged absences**: Religious observances, university activities discussed in advance

**Implementation:**
- Policy stated clearly in syllabus and reinforced in class
- Students encouraged to work ahead if they know they'll be absent
- Individual circumstances addressed case-by-case in office hours

## Grade Impact

### Direct vs. Indirect Effects

**Direct impact (5%):**
- 40 quizzes × 1 point = 40 points total
- 40 points out of 1000 total = 4% (rounded to 5% in grade breakdown)
- With 10 dropped, can miss 10 classes without grade impact

**Indirect impact (much larger):**

| Course Component | How Attendance Affects It |
|-----------------|--------------------------|
| **Fragment accumulation (14%)** | In-class writing generates fragments; absences = fewer fragments |
| **Peer review (9%)** | Missing peer review days → latecomer groups → lower-quality feedback |
| **Process documentation (10%)** | Workflow logs document in-class sessions; absences = fewer logged sessions |
| **Portfolio (50%)** | Missed instruction → weaker portfolio; missed peer feedback → less revision |

**Total potential indirect impact**: 83% of grade affected by what you miss when absent

**Pedagogical message:**
The quiz grade is the least important reason to attend. The real cost of absences is missed learning, collaborative work, and writing practice.

---

## Tardiness Approach

### Why Flexible on Tardiness?

**Quiz structure accommodates moderate lateness:**
- Word of the day displayed for 10-15 minutes (allows time to arrive)
- Quiz open all class (can complete even if arrive late)
- No separate "tardy" penalty beyond missing activities

**Equity considerations:**
- Students with bus-dependent commutes may face unpredictable delays
- Students with childcare responsibilities may occasionally run late
- Students with disabilities may need extra time navigating campus

**When tardiness becomes problematic:**
- Chronic pattern disrupts class and indicates deeper issue
- Address individually in office hours rather than punitive policy

**Research base:**
- Rocca, Kelly A. "Student Participation in the College Classroom: An Extended Multidisciplinary Literature Review." *Communication Education* 59.2 (2010): 185-213.
  - Punitive tardiness policies correlated with lower overall engagement; flexible policies maintain classroom climate

---

## Implementation Approach

### Communication Strategy

**Week 1:**
- Full policy explained in syllabus
- Class discussion: Why does attendance matter in THIS course? (Not generic "because I said so")
- Demonstration of quiz format and Canvas gradebook tracking

**Ongoing:**
- Word of the day displayed prominently at start of class
- Verbal reminder to complete quiz at beginning and end of class
- Individual outreach if absence patterns emerge (5+ absences by Week 8)

### Monitoring and Intervention

**Automated tracking:**
- Canvas gradebook shows all quiz grades
- Students can self-monitor their absences

**Instructor monitoring:**
- Week 8 check: Identify students with 5+ absences
- Email or in-person check-in: "I notice you've missed several classes—is everything okay? Can I help?"
- Referral to student support services if needed (CAPS, Student Care Network, DRS)

**Proactive support:**
- If attendance pattern indicates crisis, reach out before student fails
- Offer paths forward: incomplete, withdrawal, modified timeline
- Connect student to resources beyond course (counseling, academic coaching)

### Flexibility

**DRS accommodations may include:**
- Modified attendance requirements
- Alternative ways to verify engagement (e.g., written reflections instead of in-class quizzes)
- Extended time for in-class writing activities

**Religious accommodations:**
- Pre-arranged absences for holy days don't use grace period
- Alternative assignments for missed peer review or in-class activities
- Student responsible for initiating conversation in first two weeks

---

## Emergency Provisions

### Extended Illness or Crisis

**When to contact instructor:**
- Extended illness (more than 3-4 consecutive class meetings)
- Family crisis (death, serious illness)
- Personal crisis (mental health, housing instability, financial emergency)

**Options available:**
1. **Modified timeline**: Adjust deadlines for specific assignments
2. **Incomplete grade**: Complete coursework after semester ends (requires Dean of Students approval)
3. **Withdrawal**: Drop course without academic penalty (depending on timing)
4. **Continued enrollment with support**: Referrals to CAPS, Student Care Network, food pantry, etc.

**Documentation:**
- Dean of Students can provide "student absence notification" for crises
- Medical documentation for extended illness
- Not required for routine use of 10-quiz grace period

---

## Known Tensions

### Potential Issues

**Issue**: Students may "save" all 10 dropped quizzes for end of semester and then skip constantly
**Response**: Quiz drop is automatic (lowest 10), so strategic saving doesn't work. If students skip frequently at end, it signals either (a) they're already failing and given up, or (b) they've calculated they can pass without attending. Either way, indirect grade impacts (missed learning) will show in portfolio.

**Issue**: Latecomer groups feel like punishment
**Response**: Frame as natural consequence of collaborative work, not imposed penalty. Emphasize that students who submit on time benefit from better peer review. Acknowledge frustration but maintain structure.

**Issue**: Some students may feel 10 dropped quizzes is too generous (encourages skipping)
**Response**: Data from previous semesters will show whether most students exhaust grace period or not. If abuse is widespread, reduce to 8 dropped quizzes. However, generosity likely benefits students who genuinely need it more than it enables skipping.

**Issue**: Exit ticket reflections may be superficial ("It was good")
**Response**: Model good exit tickets in early weeks. Highlight exemplary responses (anonymized). Remind students that thoughtful reflection is part of engagement. Don't grade exit ticket quality (completion only) but use feedback to adjust instruction.

### Competing Values

**Value tension**: **Flexibility vs. accountability**
- Generous forgiveness policy supports flexibility
- Peer review firm deadlines enforce accountability
- **Resolution**: Different components have different needs; attendance quizzes flexible, peer review deadlines firm

**Value tension**: **Individual circumstances vs. collaborative obligations**
- Individual students face life challenges requiring absences
- Collaborative work depends on everyone showing up
- **Resolution**: Grace period accommodates individual needs; latecomer groups protect students who show up on time

**Value tension**: **Trust vs. verification**
- Trust-based approach (no doctor's notes for routine absences)
- But verification needed to ensure presence and engagement
- **Resolution**: Quiz format verifies without surveillance; documentation only for extended crises

---

## Evidence & Iteration

### Evidence to Collect

**Policy effectiveness**:
- [ ] What percentage of students exhaust their 10-quiz grace period?
- [ ] How many students have 11+ absences by end of semester?
- [ ] Are latecomer groups consistently rated as less helpful than on-time groups?
- [ ] Do exit ticket reflections provide useful formative feedback on instruction?

**Student outcomes**:
- [ ] Correlation between quiz grades and portfolio grades (does attendance predict learning?)
- [ ] Correlation between absences and fragment accumulation (as expected)
- [ ] Mid-semester survey: Do students understand and appreciate grace period?

**Equity indicators**:
- [ ] Are certain student populations (first-gen, low-income, students of color) absent more frequently?
- [ ] If so, why? (Transportation, work schedules, feeling unwelcome, illness)
- [ ] Are accommodations reaching students who need them?

### Revision Notes

**Based on piloting, consider adjusting:**

- **Dropped quiz number**: If 10 is too generous (widespread abuse), reduce to 8. If too stingy (many students at 11-12 absences), increase to 12.
- **Quiz format**: If exit ticket reflections are consistently superficial, add more structured prompts or drop exit ticket requirement
- **Latecomer group messaging**: If students perceive as punishment rather than natural consequence, revise framing in policy language
- **Intervention timing**: If Week 8 check-in is too late for at-risk students, move to Week 5-6
- **Documentation requirements**: If extended absence requests become burdensome, clarify what level of documentation is expected
