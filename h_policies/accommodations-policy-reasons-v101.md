## Design Philosophy

### Core Pedagogical Principle

Accommodations should be **normalized rather than exceptional**. While formal accommodations require DRS approval for legal and institutional reasons, the course's design philosophy treats accessibility as integral to good pedagogy for all students, not special treatment for disabled students. This aligns with Universal Design for Learning (UDL) principles: flexible formats, multiple means of representation/action/expression, and built-in supports benefit everyone.

The policy is intentionally **brief and primarily procedural** because accommodation details are individualized and covered by DRS letter. The course policy's role is to (a) point students to proper channels, (b) commit to timely implementation, and (c) maintain confidentiality.

### Theoretical Grounding

**Universal Design for Learning (UDL):**
- Rather than retrofitting accessibility for disabled students, design for variability from the start
- Multiple formats (index cards, digital text, audio workflow logs) serve different learning preferences and accessibility needs
- Flexible deadlines and forgiveness structures accommodate disability-related absences without requiring disclosure

**Key Sources:**
- Rose [[@rose1989livet]], David H., and Anne Meyer. *Teaching Every Student in the Digital Age: Universal Design for Learning*. ASCD, 2002.
  - UDL framework provides multiple means of engagement, representation, and action/expression
- Dolmage, Jay Timothy. *Academic Ableism: Disability and Higher Education*. U of Michigan P, 2017.
  - Higher education structures often assume "normal" student; UDL disrupts this assumption

**Concepts Applied:**
- **Process documentation flexibility**: Workflow logs can be text, audio, video—accommodates different processing styles
- **Portfolio structure**: Allows recovery from earlier struggles; values growth over consistent perfection
- **Forgiveness mechanisms**: 10 dropped quizzes, late work penalties (vs. rejection), graduated consequences

## Policy Rationale

### Purpose & Goals

**What this policy accomplishes:**
1. **Compliance**: Meets legal requirements (ADA, Section 504) and WSU institutional policy
2. **Clarity**: Directs students to proper channels (DRS) while committing to implementation
3. **Confidentiality**: Protects student privacy regarding disability information
4. **Accessibility**: Embeds accessible design principles into course structure for all students

**Why brief policy:**
- Accommodations are individualized; can't predict all scenarios in policy document
- DRS letter specifies exactly what accommodations apply; course policy doesn't need to duplicate
- Implementation happens through individual conversation, not policy text
- Overly detailed policy might inadvertently exclude accommodations not listed

---

## Access Center Process

### Why Accommodations Require DRS Approval

**Legal requirements:**
- ADA and Section 504 require "reasonable accommodations" but don't define specifics
- DRS provides expertise in determining what accommodations are appropriate for specific disabilities
- DRS documentation protects both student (ensures accommodation) and instructor (verifies need)

**Institutional reasons:**
- Consistency across courses (same disability → same accommodation)
- Professional staff trained in disability law and accommodation strategies
- Coordination with other campus services (testing center, note-takers, etc.)

**Why instructor can't provide accommodations without DRS letter:**
- Liability: Instructor isn't qualified to determine what accommodations are medically necessary
- Fairness: Without DRS vetting, creates potential for discrimination ("I believe Student A but not Student B")
- Capacity: Instructor can't verify documentation or navigate complex medical/legal requirements

**Alternative for informal support:**
For minor, temporary issues or when student chooses not to pursue formal accommodations, instructor can offer flexibility (extensions, alternative arrangements) on case-by-case basis. But this is distinct from formal ADA accommodations.

## Implementation Examples

### How Course Structure Supports Accommodations

Different accommodations interact with course structure in different ways:

**Extended time:**
- **In-class writing**: Student stays after class or uses separate session with timer
- **Peer review**: Eli Review cycles have multi-day windows; extended time typically unnecessary
- **Portfolio**: No time limit; extended time not applicable
- **Daily quizzes**: Quiz open throughout class provides natural extended time; can remain open longer if needed

**Modified attendance:**
- **Grace period**: 10 dropped quizzes already provides substantial flexibility (1.5 weeks)
- **Additional flexibility**: Student with chronic illness might need more; DRS letter specifies
- **Implementation**: Track actual absences vs. accommodation allowance; no penalty within approved limit

**Alternative formats:**
- **Reading materials**: Can provide digital text, audio recordings, large print versions
- **Assignments**: Fragments can be dictated rather than typed; portfolio can include multimodal elements
- **Process documentation**: Workflow logs can be audio journals instead of written logs

**Note-taking support:**
- **Peer note-taker**: DRS arranges; student receives notes after each class
- **Recording lectures**: Student can record class sessions (with permission; stated in syllabus)
- **Digital handouts**: All slides, assignment sheets posted to Canvas

**Testing accommodations:**
- **Not heavily applicable**: Course has minimal testing (daily quizzes only; no midterm/final exams)
- **Quizzes**: Can be administered in quiet room with extended time if DRS letter specifies
- **Portfolio**: Self-paced; extended time not typically needed

---

## Confidentiality and Disclosure

### Privacy Protections

**What instructor knows:**
- Student has DRS-approved accommodations (accommodation letter states specifics)
- What accommodations to provide (extended time, alternative formats, etc.)

**What instructor doesn't need to know:**
- Specific diagnosis or medical details
- Student's entire accommodation history (only current letter applies)
- Personal information about how disability affects student outside class

**Student controls disclosure:**
- Can share as much or as little as they want about their disability
- Can choose whether to disclose to peers (e.g., explaining why they leave class to use testing center)
- Instructor maintains confidentiality unless student gives permission to share

**Legal protection:**
- FERPA protects accommodation information as part of education records
- ADA prohibits discrimination based on disability
- Instructor violating confidentiality could face legal consequences

**Pedagogical reason for privacy:**
Creating safe, trusting environment where students feel comfortable requesting accommodations requires absolute confidentiality. If students fear disclosure, they may forgo needed accommodations.

## Universal Design

### Accessibility for All

**UDL principle**: Features designed for accessibility often benefit all students.

**Examples from this course:**

| Feature | Designed For | Benefits Everyone |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| Flexible formats (index cards OR digital) | Students with motor disabilities | Students with different writing preferences |
| Audio workflow logs option | Students who struggle with writing | Verbal processors, students who drive long commutes |
| 10 dropped quizzes | Students with chronic illness | All students facing routine illness, emergencies |
| Multiple feedback sources (peer, instructor, self) | Students with learning disabilities | All students benefit from diverse perspectives |
| Portfolio revision structure | Students needing extended time | All students benefit from revision without penalty |

**Why UDL reduces need for accommodations:**
- Some students who might otherwise need formal accommodations find built-in flexibility sufficient
- Reduces stigma (accessible features aren't marked as "special")
- Improves learning for everyone (multiple modalities, clear expectations, forgiveness)

**Research base:**
- Rose, David H., Wendy S. Harbour, Catherine Sam Johnston, Samantha G. Daley, and Linda Abarbanell. "Universal Design for Learning in Postsecondary Education." *Journal of Postsecondary Education and Disability* 19.2 (2006): 135-151.
  - UDL implementation in higher ed improves outcomes for disabled and non-disabled students

## Mental Health Parity

### Why Mental Health Accommodations Matter

**Historical context:**
- Mental health disabilities long stigmatized and excluded from accommodation frameworks
- ADA Amendments Act (2008) clarified mental health conditions qualify for accommodations

**Common mental health accommodations:**
- **Attendance flexibility**: Depression, anxiety can make attendance unpredictable
- **Extended time**: Anxiety can slow processing; ADHD makes sustained focus difficult
- **Reduced course load**: Managing mental illness while taking full course load may be impossible
- **Quiet testing environment**: Anxiety, sensory processing issues benefit from low-stimulus space

**Why course structure supports mental health:**
- Quiz grace period accommodates mental health days without disclosure
- Portfolio structure allows recovery from crisis periods (late semester surge possible)
- Process documentation valued (showing engagement) even if productivity inconsistent
- Peer review provides supportive feedback, not just evaluative judgment

**Reducing stigma:**
- Policy mentions mental health explicitly (normalizes it)
- CAPS resources listed alongside DRS
- Language emphasizes wellness, not deficit

**Research base:**
- Fleming, Alicia R., et al. "Best Practice Models of Effective Vocational Rehabilitation Service Delivery in the Public Rehabilitation Program." *Rehabilitation Counseling Bulletin* 56.3 (2013): 146-159.
  - Mental health accommodations improve retention and success rates

## Timing and Retroactivity

### Why Encourage Early Request

**Practical reasons:**
- DRS process takes 2-3 weeks; starting early ensures accommodations in place from Day 1
- Some accommodations (note-takers, testing center space) require advance arrangement
- Instructor and student need time to discuss implementation logistics

**Pedagogical reasons:**
- Students benefit from accommodations throughout semester, not just at end
- Early accommodations prevent small struggles from becoming failing grades
- Proactive support more effective than crisis intervention

**Why accommodations not retroactive:**
- **Legal**: ADA requires "prospective" accommodations, not retroactive grade changes
- **Fairness**: Changing past grades based on new accommodations creates inequities vs. students who had accommodations from start
- **Practical**: Can't redo peer review cycles, undo missed classes, or recreate past learning opportunities

**What "not retroactive" means:**
- Cannot change grades on work submitted before accommodation approved
- Cannot excuse absences that occurred before accommodation in place
- CAN apply accommodations to all future work starting immediately

**Exception:**
If DRS letter is delayed due to DRS processing (not student delay), instructor may exercise discretion in applying accommodations to recent work. But this is instructor choice, not requirement.

---

## Temporary vs Permanent

### Why Temporary Accommodations Exist

**Examples:**
- Broken arm → 6-8 weeks unable to write by hand
- Concussion → 2-4 weeks needing reduced screen time, extended deadlines
- Surgery recovery → 1-2 weeks absence, then gradual return
- Pregnancy complications → variable timeline, potentially entire semester

**DRS process for temporary:**
- Medical documentation required (states expected duration)
- Accommodation letter includes end date
- Renewal possible if condition lasts longer than expected

**When informal arrangement more practical:**
- Very brief issue (1-2 weeks)
- Simple accommodation (dictation instead of typing)
- Late in semester (formal process would take longer than condition lasts)

**Risk of informal:**
- No formal documentation if issue escalates or student later alleges discrimination
- Inconsistent application across students
- Instructor not qualified to determine medical necessity

**Best practice:**
Encourage DRS process even for temporary issues unless truly brief (<2 weeks) AND simple accommodation AND student prefers informal approach.

## Shared Responsibility

### Partnership Model

**Student responsibilities:**
- Initiate DRS process
- Share accommodation letter with instructor
- Communicate about needs and implementation logistics
- Follow through on using accommodations (extended time, testing center, etc.)

**Instructor responsibilities:**
- Implement accommodations promptly and fully
- Maintain confidentiality
- Communicate clearly about course requirements and how accommodations apply
- Be flexible when standard accommodations don't quite fit course structure

**DRS responsibilities:**
- Determine what accommodations are appropriate
- Provide accommodation letters
- Coordinate services (note-takers, testing center)
- Mediate if disputes arise

**Why partnership:**
Accommodations work best when everyone communicates and collaborates. Top-down ("instructor grants accommodation to passive student") OR bottom-up ("student demands accommodation from resistant instructor") models create friction. Partnership emphasizes shared goal: student success.

**When partnership breaks down:**
If student and instructor can't agree on accommodation implementation, DRS mediates. DRS determination is final (instructor must comply).

## Instructor Obligations

### Legal and Ethical Requirements

**Legal (ADA, Section 504):**
- Must provide approved accommodations
- Cannot question need or require student to disclose diagnosis
- Must maintain confidentiality
- Cannot retaliate against student for requesting accommodations

**Ethical (professional responsibility):**
- Create welcoming environment where students feel safe requesting accommodations
- Proactively design accessible course (UDL principles)
- Respond promptly to accommodation requests
- Flexibility when formal accommodations don't quite fit or when student faces barriers

**What instructor can do:**
- Discuss HOW to implement accommodations in this specific course
- Suggest student consult DRS about additional accommodations that might help
- Provide informal flexibility for minor issues not requiring formal accommodations

**What instructor cannot do:**
- Refuse approved accommodations
- Require medical documentation (DRS handles this)
- Share student's disability information without permission
- Provide accommodations without DRS approval (creates liability)

---

## Known Tensions

### Potential Issues

**Issue**: Student requests accommodation that fundamentally changes course learning objectives
**Response**: This is rare, but if it happens, DRS mediates. Example: Student requests to skip all peer review because of social anxiety. Peer review is essential learning objective, not peripheral activity. DRS would work with student to find alternative (e.g., asynchronous peer review, smaller groups) that preserves learning objective while accommodating disability.

**Issue**: Student shares accommodation letter late in semester, then struggles because they didn't have accommodations earlier
**Response**: Apply accommodations going forward, but emphasize early request benefits them. Can't retroactively change grades, but can discuss incomplete or withdrawal if student is too far behind to recover.

**Issue**: Student with accommodation misses deadline and claims accommodation covers it, but DRS letter doesn't specify
**Response**: Refer to DRS letter for specifics. If letter says "attendance flexibility," clarify what that means (how many additional absences beyond standard grace period). If letter doesn't cover deadline extensions, student doesn't automatically get them.

**Issue**: Informal accommodations create precedent other students reference
**Response**: Be cautious about informal flexibility. If provided to one student, be prepared to provide to others with similar circumstances. Better to encourage DRS process for consistency.

## Evidence & Iteration

### Evidence to Collect

**Accommodation effectiveness**:
- [ ] Are accommodations implemented successfully from instructor and student perspectives?
- [ ] Do students with accommodations succeed at similar rates to non-accommodated students?
- [ ] Are there barriers to accommodation implementation in this course structure?

**Access and inclusion**:
- [ ] What percentage of students have DRS accommodations? (National average ~10-15%)
- [ ] Do students feel comfortable requesting accommodations? (survey question)
- [ ] Are UDL features serving all students as intended?

**Process improvement**:
- [ ] Do students request accommodations within first two weeks as policy encourages?
- [ ] Are there common accommodation requests that could be built into course design for everyone?

### Revision Notes

**Based on piloting, consider adjusting:**
- **UDL features**: If audio workflow logs or other flexible formats widely adopted, emphasize as standard option (not just accommodation)
- **Accommodation meeting**: If meetings not happening, build in required check-in for all DRS students Week 2
- **Mental health support**: If many students struggling with mental health, increase CAPS visibility and normalize seeking support
- **Temporary accommodations**: If many students have temporary issues, create clearer guidance on when to use DRS vs. informal arrangement
