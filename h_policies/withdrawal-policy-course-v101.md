## Policy Statement

### University Withdrawal Policies

Course withdrawal is governed by **Washington State University Academic Regulations**, not by individual instructors. This policy provides course-specific guidance and points you to official university procedures.

If you're considering withdrawal, **please talk to me first** so we can discuss alternatives and ensure you understand the implications.

**Official WSU policies**: https://registrar.wsu.edu/academic-regulations/

**Justification**: [[withdrawal-policy-reasons-v101#Policy Rationale|Why discuss before withdrawing]]

## When to Consider Withdrawal

### Withdrawal May Be Appropriate If:

**You're facing circumstances that prevent course completion:**
- Extended illness or hospitalization
- Family crisis or emergency
- Significant life changes (job relocation, family needs)
- Mental health crisis requiring intensive treatment

**Your academic situation has changed:**
- You're significantly behind and can't realistically catch up
- You're failing and withdrawal would prevent F on transcript
- Course is wrong level or not what you expected

**Financial or scheduling conflicts:**
- You need to reduce credit load for financial aid reasons
- Work schedule changed and you can't attend class

### Talk to Me Before Withdrawing

**We can discuss:**
- Whether you're actually as far behind as you think
- Whether incomplete grade might be better option (see below)
- What grade you'd likely earn if you continue
- Strategies for catching up or finishing strong
- Whether withdrawal is reversible decision or necessary

**I can provide:**
- Honest assessment of your current standing
- Information about what work remains
- Support if you choose to continue
- Understanding if you choose to withdraw

**Justification**: [[withdrawal-policy-reasons-v101#Advising Role|Why instructor consultation matters]]

## Withdrawal Deadlines and Process

### Important Dates

**WSU withdrawal deadlines change each semester.** Check the official academic calendar:
https://registrar.wsu.edu/academic-calendar/

**Typical timeline (verify for your specific semester):**

**Week 1-2: Add/Drop Period**
- Drop with full tuition refund
- No record of enrollment on transcript
- Process: myWSU self-service

**Week 3-10: Withdrawal Period**
- W (Withdrawal) appears on transcript
- Partial or no tuition refund (depends on timing)
- Process: Requires instructor signature (I will sign)

**After Week 10: Petition Required**
- Must petition Dean of Students for late withdrawal
- Requires documented emergency or extenuating circumstances
- W appears on transcript if approved

**Final Exam Week: No Withdrawal**
- Cannot withdraw after final exam period begins
- Must complete course or receive grade earned

### How to Withdraw

**During official withdrawal period:**
1. Talk to me first (strongly recommended, not required)
2. Go to myWSU → Student Center → Enrollment
3. Drop the course (will show as W on transcript)
4. Verify in myWSU that withdrawal processed

**After official withdrawal period:**
1. Talk to me about your situation
2. Contact Dean of Students office to request late withdrawal petition
3. Provide documentation of extenuating circumstances
4. Dean reviews petition and approves/denies
5. If approved, Registrar processes withdrawal

**Justification**: [[withdrawal-policy-reasons-v101#University Procedures|Standard process]]

## Incomplete Grades

### When Incomplete (I) Is Appropriate

An **incomplete grade (I)** allows you to finish coursework after the semester ends.

**Incomplete is appropriate when:**
- You've completed substantial portion of course (typically 75%+)
- Circumstances beyond your control prevent completion (illness, emergency)
- You can reasonably complete work within one semester

**Incomplete is NOT appropriate when:**
- You're simply behind due to poor time management
- You've completed less than 75% of course
- You're failing and incomplete would just delay F
- You haven't attended or engaged with course consistently

### How Incompletes Work

**Process:**
1. Contact me to request incomplete
2. We discuss what work remains and create completion timeline
3. I submit incomplete grade with contract specifying requirements
4. You have up to one year to complete (but we'll set shorter deadline)
5. Once completed, I change I to earned grade
6. If not completed by deadline, I automatically becomes F

**What you need to complete:**
- Any missing major assignments (reflective one-pagers, portfolio)
- Portfolio assembly and cover letter
- Any other work specified in incomplete contract

**What carries over:**
- Fragments already submitted
- Peer reviews already completed  
- Quiz grades already earned

**Justification**: [[withdrawal-policy-reasons-v101#Incomplete Philosophy|When incompletes serve learning]]

## Financial Aid Implications

### Impact of Withdrawal

**Withdrawing from this course may affect:**

**Financial aid eligibility:**
- Must maintain minimum credit hours for financial aid (typically 12 for full-time)
- Dropping below threshold can trigger repayment or loss of aid
- Multiple withdrawals may affect satisfactory academic progress (SAP)

**Tuition refund:**
- Timing of withdrawal determines refund percentage
- After certain point, you owe full tuition even if you withdraw
- Check WSU refund schedule: https://admission.wsu.edu/tuition-fees/

**Academic standing:**
- W doesn't affect GPA (not counted as F)
- But excessive Ws on transcript can raise red flags for graduate schools, scholarships

**Veteran's benefits:**
- VA education benefits have specific withdrawal rules
- Contact WSU Veterans Services before withdrawing: 509-335-6366

**International students:**
- F-1 visa requires full-time enrollment (12 credits undergraduate)
- Withdrawing might drop you below requirement
- Contact International Programs before withdrawing: 509-335-4508

**ALWAYS talk to Financial Aid Office before withdrawing:**
- Location: Lighty Student Services Building 280
- Phone: 509-335-9711
- Email: financialaid@wsu.edu
- Website: https://financialaid.wsu.edu

## Alternatives to Withdrawal

### Options to Consider First

**If you're struggling but haven't exhausted options:**

**1. Late work with penalties**
- This course accepts late work (20-50% penalties depending on lateness)
- Better to submit late and take penalty than not submit at all
- Portfolio grading means you can still recover

**2. Incomplete grade**
- If you've done most of the work but facing crisis
- Allows finishing over break or next semester
- Better outcome than W if you can complete within timeline

**3. Modified timeline**
- Talk to me about adjusting specific deadlines
- May be possible for documented emergencies
- Requires DRS accommodation or Dean of Students support

**4. Focus on portfolio**
- Formative work already completed still counts
- Strong portfolio can compensate for weaker formative work
- You might be closer to passing than you think

**5. Support services**
- **Academic Success and Career Center**: Study skills, time management coaching
  - https://ascc.wsu.edu
- **Cougar Health Services**: If illness is barrier
  - 509-335-3575
- **CAPS**: If mental health is affecting performance
  - 509-335-2159
- **Student Care Network**: For complex life circumstances
  - https://studentcare.wsu.edu

## If You Do Withdraw

### What Happens Next

**Immediate effects:**
- You're no longer enrolled in course
- Cannot access Canvas after semester ends
- No longer required to attend or submit work
- W appears on transcript

**Long-term considerations:**
- Will you retake ENGL 101? (It's required for degree)
- How does this affect your graduation timeline?
- What did you learn about your needs/capacity that will help next time?

### If You Plan to Retake

**What I recommend:**

**Before next semester:**
- Reflect on what made this semester difficult
- Address underlying issues (time management, health, academic preparation)
- Consider different semester timing (fall vs. spring, summer intensive)

**When you retake:**
- Apply for DRS accommodations if you need them (even if you didn't this time)
- Start strong—don't skip early weeks thinking they're "just introduction"
- Use office hours early and often
- Don't wait until you're failing to ask for help

**Justification**: [[withdrawal-policy-reasons-v101#Learning from Withdrawal|Growth mindset approach]]

## Emergency Withdrawal

### Campus-Wide Crisis or Personal Emergency

**University emergency withdrawal:**
- Available during campus emergencies (pandemic, natural disaster, etc.)
- Dean of Students coordinates campus-wide process
- Typically allows withdrawal from all courses without petition

**Personal emergency withdrawal:**
- Requires petition to Dean of Students

## Common Questions

**Q: Will withdrawal show on my transcript?**
**A:** Yes. W appears on transcript if you withdraw during official withdrawal period (typically Week 3-10). W does not affect GPA.

**Q: Can I withdraw after the deadline?**
**A:** Only with Dean of Students approval for documented emergency. Contact Dean's office to discuss petition.

**Q: Should I withdraw if I'm failing?**
**A:** Talk to me first. Portfolio structure means you might be able to recover. W is better than F on transcript, but I might be better if you can finish.

**Q: Can I get a refund if I withdraw?**
**A:** Depends on timing. Early withdrawal = partial refund. After certain point, no refund. Check WSU refund schedule.

**Q: If I withdraw, can I retake the course pass/fail?**
**A:** ENGL 101 must be taken for grade (A-F). Cannot take pass/fail because it's required for degree.
