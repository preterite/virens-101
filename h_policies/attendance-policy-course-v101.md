## Policy Statement

### Why Attendance Matters

This is a course about writing, and we do much of the writing in class. The course uses a flipped classroom model: most writing happens in class, most reading happens for homework, and discussion happens both in-class and online. You need to be in class to do the writing, participate in peer review, and engage in collaborative activities.

Attendance is also about professionalization. Showing up on time and doing the work required of you are fundamental professional habits that transfer beyond this class.

**This course does not use traditional attendance sheets.** Instead, attendance and engagement are verified through **daily participation quizzes** with a generous forgiveness policy built in.

**Justification**: [[attendance-policy-reasons-v101#Policy Rationale|Why this approach?]]

## How Attendance Works: Daily Quizzes

### Quiz Format

Most class meetings include a brief participation quiz (approximately 40 total across the semester, worth 1 point each = 5% of final grade).

**Quiz structure:**
- **Question 1**: Enter the "word of the day" shown on the board at the start of class
- **Question 2** (exit ticket): "What about today's class was Memorable, Muddy, or made you want to know More?"

**Quiz remains open throughout class period** so you can complete it at any point during the session (beginning, middle, or end).

### Why Quizzes Instead of Attendance Sheets?

Quizzes verify two things simultaneously:
1. **Presence**: You were in class (word of the day)
2. **Engagement**: You participated in and thought about class activities (exit ticket reflection)

Unlike attendance sheets (which only track presence), quizzes ensure you're both physically and mentally present.

**Justification**: [[attendance-policy-reasons-v101#Quiz Design|Why this method?]]

---

## Grace Period: Dropped Quizzes

**Your lowest 10 quiz grades are automatically dropped.**

This gives you approximately **1.5 weeks of "free" absences** throughout the semester for:
- Illness
- Family emergencies
- Medical appointments
- Job interviews
- Personal mental health days
- Religious observances (see below for additional accommodations)
- Any other reason—no questions asked

**You don't need to explain or justify these absences.** The drop policy builds in flexibility for life's unpredictability.

### How to Use Your Grace Period Wisely

**Strategic use:**
- Save some dropped quizzes for late-semester illness or stress
- Don't use all 10 in the first month unless absolutely necessary
- Remember: Once you've used 10, additional absences affect your grade

**What the grace period covers:**
- Missing class entirely (0 on quiz)
- Arriving late and missing the word of the day
- Having an off day and not engaging fully

**What it doesn't cover:**
- Peer review deadlines (see below)
- Assignment due dates (late work has separate penalties)

**Justification**: [[attendance-policy-reasons-v101#Forgiveness Policy|Why 10 dropped quizzes?]]

---

## Absences and Peer Review

### The Latecomer Group Challenge

Peer review cycles in Eli Review have **firm deadlines** because they depend on synchronous participation. If you miss the class when peer review drafts are assigned or when they're due, you create complications for your review group.

**What happens if you miss peer review day:**

You'll be sorted into the **"latecomer group"** with other students who missed that cycle's deadline. Historically, latecomer groups produce lower-quality peer reviews because:
- Reviewers are rushed (didn't have full time to draft)
- Writers receive fewer or less thoughtful reviews
- The cycle is already compressed by the delay

**This is not a punishment—it's a practical consequence.** When collaborative work depends on everyone showing up, absences affect not just you but your peers.

**Justification**: [[attendance-policy-reasons-v101#Peer Review Dependency|Why this structure?]]

### How to Avoid Latecomer Groups

1. **Prioritize peer review days**: Mark them on your calendar at the beginning of the semester
2. **Submit work on time even if you're absent**: You can upload drafts to Eli from anywhere if you can't attend class
3. **Plan ahead**: Use your dropped quizzes strategically, but don't miss peer review cycles if possible

### If You Must Miss Peer Review

**You still receive a grade for peer review completion/quality**—but being in a latecomer group typically means:
- Less helpful feedback on your draft
- Lower "helpfulness" ratings on your reviews (because they're rushed)
- Missing the in-class peer review workshop activities

## Excused Absences

### University-Recognized Absences

The following absences are officially recognized by WSU and may receive additional accommodation beyond the 10-quiz drop:

**Military service:**
- Requires official documentation
- Contact instructor as soon as orders are received

**Religious observances:**
- WSU policy requires reasonable accommodation for religious holidays
- Notify instructor **within the first two weeks of the semester**
- Include specific dates for absences
- We'll work out alternative arrangements for missed work

**Official university activities** (athletics, debate, etc.):
- Requires Class Absence Request form signed by supervising faculty/staff
- Must be submitted **at least one week in advance**
- Work must be submitted prior to leaving for the event

**Disability Resource Services (DRS) accommodations:**
- If your accommodation includes modified attendance requirements, we'll discuss implementation
- Contact instructor **within first two weeks** to arrange

**Justification**: [[attendance-policy-reasons-v101#Excused Absences|University policy compliance]]

---

## Extended Illness or Crisis

### When Absences Exceed Grace Period

If you face **extended illness, family crisis, or other significant life circumstances** that cause you to miss more than 1.5 weeks of class:

**Contact me as soon as possible** (ideally before you've exhausted your 10 dropped quizzes, if the situation is foreseeable).

**We will discuss options:**
- Modified timeline for assignments
- Alternative ways to demonstrate engagement
- Incomplete grade (if late in semester)
- Withdrawal from course (see [[withdrawal-policy-course-v101|Withdrawal Policy]])

**Documentation may be required** for extended absences due to medical or family emergencies:
- Doctor's note for extended illness
- Documentation from Dean of Students for crisis situations
- Not required for short-term absences covered by drop policy

**Justification**: [[attendance-policy-reasons-v101#Emergency Provisions|Support for crisis situations]]

---

## Absences Do Not Extend Deadlines

**Critical principle**: Missing class does not automatically extend assignment deadlines.

**Your responsibilities when absent:**
- Check Canvas for missed announcements and assignments
- Review the schedule for what was covered
- Complete any in-class writing activities on your own time
- Submit work by original deadlines unless you've arranged an extension

**If you need a deadline extension:**
- Email instructor ASAP (ideally before the deadline)
- Explain circumstances
- Propose new deadline
- Extensions granted on case-by-case basis for documented emergencies

**Justification**: [[attendance-policy-reasons-v101#Deadline Policy|Why absences don't extend deadlines]]

## Attendance and Your Grade

### Direct Impact: 5%

Daily quizzes = 40 points total = 5% of your final grade

With 10 dropped quizzes, you can miss 10 classes and still earn full quiz points.

### Indirect Impact: More Significant

Attendance affects your grade indirectly through:

**Fragment accumulation (14% of grade):**
- In-class writing produces fragments
- Missing class = missing opportunities to generate material

**Peer review (9% of grade):**
- Missing peer review days puts you in latecomer groups
- Rushed peer reviews typically receive lower helpfulness ratings

**Process documentation (10% of grade):**
- Workflow logs document in-class writing sessions
- Missing class = fewer documented writing sessions

**Learning and portfolio quality (50% of grade):**
- Class activities introduce concepts and practices you'll use in portfolio
- Missing instruction makes portfolio work harder

**Bottom line**: The 5% quiz grade is the least important reason to attend. The real cost of absences is the missed learning and collaborative work.

**Justification**: [[attendance-policy-reasons-v101#Grade Impact|Why attendance matters beyond quizzes]]

---

## Tardiness

### Late Arrival

**Quiz structure accommodates moderate lateness:**
- Word of the day is displayed for first 10-15 minutes of class
- Quiz remains open throughout class period
- If you arrive late but complete the quiz, you earn full credit

**Chronic lateness becomes a problem when:**
- You miss in-class writing activities and instructions
- You disrupt class by arriving during focused work time
- You miss peer review group formation or instructions

**If you're chronically late:** Let's talk in office hours about what's causing the pattern and how to address it.

### Early Departure

**If you must leave early:**
- Complete the quiz before departing
- Inform me at the beginning of class if possible
- Catch up on anything you missed via Canvas

**Justification**: [[attendance-policy-reasons-v101#Tardiness Approach|Why flexibility within limits]]

---

## Monitoring Your Attendance

### Checking Your Status

**Canvas gradebook** shows your current quiz score:
- Total quizzes taken
- Points earned
- Remember: Lowest 10 will be dropped at end of semester

**To calculate absences:**
- Count number of 0s in quiz column
- First 10 zeros = no impact (they'll be dropped)
- Beyond 10 = affecting your grade

### When to Be Concerned

**Yellow flag** (5-7 absences):
- You're using most of your grace period
- Consider whether you need to adjust schedule/priorities

**Red flag** (8+ absences):
- You're approaching or exceeding grace period
- Contact me to discuss strategies for success
- May indicate need for DRS accommodations or other support

**Critical** (12+ absences):
- Significant impact on learning and grade
- Likely need to discuss incomplete or withdrawal options

### Common Questions

**Q: Do I need to email you every time I'm absent?**
**A:** No. The 10-quiz drop policy covers routine absences. Only contact me if (a) you need an excused absence for religious/military/university activity, or (b) you're facing extended illness/crisis beyond the grace period.

**Q: What if I'm sick on a peer review day?**
**A:** Submit your draft to Eli anyway if you're physically able (you can do it from home). If you're too sick to write, you'll be sorted into the latecomer group for that cycle.

**Q: Can I make up a missed quiz?**
**A:** No. Quizzes cannot be made up because they verify presence. However, your lowest 10 quiz grades are dropped, so early absences don't hurt you as long as you don't exceed 10 total.

**Q: What if I have a job interview or medical appointment during class?**
**A:** Use one of your 10 dropped quizzes. You don't need permission or documentation for absences covered by the drop policy.

**Q: I'm struggling with anxiety/depression and it's affecting my attendance. What should I do?**
**A:** Please reach out. Contact CAPS for counseling support, and contact me or DRS to discuss possible accommodations. Mental health is a valid reason to seek support, and we can work together to keep you on track.
