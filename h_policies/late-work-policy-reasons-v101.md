## Design Philosophy

### Core Pedagogical Principle

Late work policy must balance three competing needs:

**1. Student flexibility** — Life circumstances vary; rigid deadlines can punish students for factors beyond their control

**2. Peer review integrity** — Late submissions disrupt feedback cycles, affecting other students' learning

**3. Learning process** — Writing development requires timely engagement with feedback, not end-of-semester cramming

The graduated penalty structure (20%/30%/50%) acknowledges that **late work is better than no work** while still incentivizing timeliness for the benefit of the collaborative learning community.

### Theoretical Grounding

**Key Sources:**
- Inoue, Asao B. "Grading Contracts: Assessing Their Effectiveness on Different Racial Formations." *Race and Writing Assessment*. Eds. Inoue and Poe. Peter Lang, 2012.
- Stommel, Jesse. "How to Ungrade." *Hybrid Pedagogy*, 2018.
- Nilson, Linda B. *Specifications Grading: Restoring Rigor, Motivating Students, and Saving Faculty Time*. Stylus, 2014.
- Conference on College Composition and Communication. "Students' Right to Their Own Language" (Revised 2014).

**Concepts Applied:**
- **Equity-minded grading** that recognizes differential access to time and resources
- **Process-based learning** that requires timely engagement with feedback cycles
- **Compassionate accountability** that balances flexibility with standards
- **Harm reduction** approach (partial credit better than zero)

## Policy Rationale

### Purpose & Goals

This late work policy addresses several challenges in first-year writing:

**Challenge 1: Peer review requires timeliness**
- **Problem**: If Student A submits draft late, Student B has nothing to review
- **Solution**: Penalties incentivize on-time submission for peers' benefit
- **Why graduated**: Sliding scale reflects degree of disruption (1 day late = minor; 8 days = misses entire cycle)

**Challenge 2: Rigid deadlines harm equity**
- **Problem**: Zero-tolerance policies disproportionately affect students with work/family obligations, illness, or crises
- **Solution**: Late work accepted with penalties (partial credit acknowledges effort)
- **Why important**: Research (Inoue 2012) shows strict late policies harm students from marginalized communities

**Challenge 3: End-of-semester dumping undermines learning**
- **Problem**: If all work can be submitted at end, students miss feedback/revision cycles
- **Solution**: Penalties increase with lateness (50% at 8+ days makes cramming unattractive)
- **Why this matters**: Writing development requires timely engagement, not retroactive completion

**Challenge 4: Students need grace for emergencies**
- **Problem**: Unexpected crises happen (illness, family emergency, mental health)
- **Solution**: Extension process for documented emergencies + built-in forgiveness (dropped quizzes)
- **Why compassionate**: Recognizes students as whole humans with lives outside classroom

**Challenge 5: Portfolio should showcase growth, not penalize early struggles**
- **Problem**: If portfolio graded with late penalties, early difficulties have lasting impact
- **Solution**: Portfolio exempt from penalties—final submission is what counts
- **Why pedagogically sound**: Allows students to recover through strong final work

## Penalty Calculation

### Why 20%/30%/50% Structure?

**1-2 days late: -20%**

**Rationale**:
- Minimal disruption to peer review (reviewers still have most of review window)
- Could be time management challenge rather than genuine emergency
- Penalty incentivizes timeliness without being punitive
- Students can recover (80% credit for quality work still contributes to grade)

**Why 20% specifically**:
- Substantial enough to matter (~2 points on 10-point assignment)
- Not so harsh that one slip destroys grade
- Comparable to "one letter grade down" in traditional grading

**3-7 days late: -30%**

**Rationale**:
- Significant disruption (likely misses entire peer review cycle)
- More serious time management issue or moderate emergency
- Penalty reflects greater impact on learning community
- Still allows 70% credit (substantial partial credit preserved)

**Why 30% specifically**:
- Represents missing substantial part of learning process
- Approximates "two letter grades down" equivalence
- Creates meaningful distinction from 1-2 day lateness
- Severe enough to deter but not eliminate late work

**8+ days late: -50%**

**Rationale**:
- Misses entire feedback cycle, potentially multiple cycles
- Suggests either serious emergency (should request extension) or chronic avoidance
- At this point, late work provides limited learning value
- Half credit acknowledges completion while reflecting missed opportunity

**Why 50% specifically**:
- Represents missing most of learning process associated with assignment
- Still better than zero (incentivizes submission for partial credit)
- Severe enough that cramming becomes unattractive
- Creates clear threshold: beyond this, work has minimal pedagogical value

**Why not steeper penalties or zero credit after deadline?**
Research (Stommel 2018, Inoue 2012) shows:
- Zero-credit policies harm equity (disproportionate impact on marginalized students)
- Even very late work has learning value (better to do it than not)
- Partial credit maintains student engagement rather than creating "why bother?" effect
- Graduated structure allows students to self-assess severity and make strategic decisions

## Assignment Types

### Why Different Treatment for Different Work?

**Fragments, Eli Reviews, Reflective One-Pagers: Standard penalties**

**Why**:
- These are formative work tied to peer review cycles
- Timeliness matters for collaborative learning
- Multiple opportunities across semester (missing one hurts but isn't devastating)
- Students can recover through subsequent submissions

**Daily Quizzes: Not accepted late**

**Why**:
- Designed to verify attendance and reading completion
- Value is in day-of participation
- Built-in forgiveness (10 lowest dropped = ~1.5 weeks free absences)
- Accepting late quizzes would require tracking/grading outside class time
- Purpose (attendance incentive) doesn't work if retroactive completion allowed

**Portfolio: Exempt from penalties**

**Why**:
- Due at end of semester (no subsequent work disrupted by lateness)
- Represents culmination of learning (should showcase growth, not penalize process)
- Extensions available through formal university processes for documented emergencies
- High-stakes nature requires flexibility
- Pedagogically sound: allows students who struggled early to demonstrate learning through final work

**Process Documentation: Standard penalties on check-ins**

**Why**:
- Periodic check-ins (Weeks 4, 8, 12) maintain accountability
- Dev logs document ongoing process, not single submissions
- Penalties apply to readiness at check-in, not to entire log
- Students can catch up and show progress at next check-in

## Grace Periods

### Why Technical Buffers Matter

**11:59 PM Friday = technically Saturday morning**

**Why this grace period**:
- Accounts for students working until midnight
- Canvas submission takes time (upload, confirm, etc.)
- Students shouldn't be penalized for submitting 12:01 AM vs. 11:59 PM
- Common practice across university courses

**2-hour buffer for Canvas outages**

**Why this matters**:
- Technical failures beyond student control shouldn't count as lateness
- Students must email immediately when issue noticed (prevents gaming)
- Screenshot requirement ensures good faith
- Rare but important equity consideration

**Email submission accepted if Canvas fails**

**Why**:
- Alternative pathway preserves deadline when system fails
- Timestamp on email provides evidence
- Prevents technical issues from becoming late submissions
- Students' work shouldn't suffer from institutional tech problems

**These buffers don't extend deadlines—they protect students from technical failures beyond their control.**

---

## Implementation Approach

### How This Works in Practice

**Clear communication**:
- Deadlines posted in three places: Canvas calendar, assignment sheet, in-class announcement
- 24-hour reminder for major deadlines (Canvas announcement)
- Students taught to use Canvas calendar + personal reminders

**Why redundancy**: Students manage multiple courses, work, family—clear communication prevents "I didn't know" issues

**Transparent calculation**:
- Canvas gradebook shows penalty applied
- Comment explains: "Submitted 3 days late: 10 points - (10 × 0.30) = 7 points"
- Students can verify calculation

**Why transparency**: Removes perception of arbitrary grading, teaches students how policies work mathematically

**Tracking systems**:
- Canvas timestamps provide objective record
- Instructor monitors submission patterns for students who need outreach
- Week 8 midterm check includes late work pattern discussion if needed

**Why proactive**: Early intervention helps students recover before situation becomes critical

## Equity Considerations

### Who Does This Policy Serve?

**Advantages for equity**:
- **Late work accepted** (zero-tolerance policies disproportionately harm marginalized students)
- **Partial credit preserved** (50% for very late work still better than zero)
- **Built-in forgiveness** (dropped quizzes account for life circumstances)
- **Extension process** (documented emergencies accommodated)
- **Portfolio exempt** (students can recover from difficult semester start)

**Potential disadvantages**:
- **Penalties still hurt** (students without time/resource stability more likely to submit late)
- **Documentation required for extensions** (not all emergencies are documentable; some students lack access to healthcare for notes)
- **Peer review disruption** (students without stable schedules may struggle to meet collaborative deadlines)

**Mitigations implemented**:
- **Graduated structure** (20% for minor lateness less punitive than zero)
- **Dean of Students coordination** (emergency situations can be verified without student providing medical details)
- **Office hours outreach** (instructor monitors patterns, offers support proactively)
- **Multiple submission opportunities** (fragments weekly; missing one doesn't derail semester)

**Ongoing question**: Does penalty structure adequately balance flexibility with peer review needs? Alternative: ungraded peer review with completion-only credit?

## Pedagogical Philosophy

### Why Deadlines Matter in Process-Based Course

**Traditional argument for deadlines**:
- "Teaches time management"
- "Prepares students for workplace expectations"
- "Prevents procrastination"

**Why this reasoning is insufficient**:
- Assumes students lack discipline (deficit framing)
- Ignores structural inequities (work/family obligations, access to resources)
- Treats writing as product delivered on schedule, not process developed over time

**VIRENS 101's argument for deadlines**:
- **Peer review requires coordination** (Student A's draft becomes Student B's learning material)
- **Feedback timing matters** (early feedback more useful than late feedback)
- **Revision cycles build on each other** (late work misses opportunities to iterate)
- **Process documentation requires ongoing engagement** (can't retroactively create authentic dev log)

**This shifts focus from deadline compliance to collaborative responsibility and learning process integrity.**

## Grade Impact

### Why Penalties Are Meaningful But Not Devastating

**Scenario analysis** (from student-facing policy):

**Occasional lateness (3-4 late assignments)**: ~1-2% final grade impact
- **Why this matters**: Single slip-up won't destroy grade
- **Pedagogical message**: We all have off weeks; built-in flexibility

**Chronic lateness (15+ late assignments)**: ~7-10% final grade impact  
- **Why this matters**: Pattern of lateness significantly affects formative score
- **Pedagogical message**: Consistent engagement matters for learning

**Extreme lateness (most work 8+ days late)**: ~15-20% final grade impact
- **Why this matters**: Missing most learning process reflected in grade
- **Pedagogical message**: This course values process; can't shortcut it

**Recovery mechanisms**:
- Fragment accumulation assessed across semester (can catch up in lighter weeks)
- Portfolio worth 50% of grade (strong final work can compensate)
- Dropped quizzes build in forgiveness for absences

**Why this calibration**:
- Penalties incentivize timeliness without being punitive
- Students can recover from difficult periods
- Grade reflects both process engagement and final achievement
- Doesn't create "I'm already too far behind" despair

## Alternative Approaches Considered

### Option A: Zero Tolerance (Rejected)

**Policy**: No late work accepted; zero credit after deadline

**Rejected because**:
- Harms equity (Inoue 2012)
- Doesn't acknowledge that life circumstances vary
- Creates "why bother?" effect if student falls behind
- Contradicts course's compassionate pedagogy

### Option B: Unlimited Extensions (Rejected)

**Policy**: Accept all work until end of semester, no penalties

**Rejected because**:
- Undermines peer review cycles (students would have nothing to review)
- Enables procrastination (everything due Week 15)
- Defeats purpose of process-based learning (can't cram writing development)
- Unfair to students who manage time effectively

### Option C: Contract-Based (Rejected for this course)

**Policy**: Students contract for grade; completing all work on time = B, late work = C or lower

**Rejected because**:
- Department requires traditional grading
- Less flexible than graduated penalties (binary on-time/late distinction)
- Doesn't account for degrees of lateness
- Strong model but not feasible in institutional context

### Option D: Specifications Grading (Rejected for this course)

**Policy**: Work assessed as meets/doesn't meet specs; late work can't meet specs

**Rejected because**:
- Too rigid for writing assessment (quality is spectrum, not binary)
- Late work can still demonstrate learning
- Doesn't fit departmental grading expectations
- Better for STEM than humanities contexts

### Option E: Graduated Penalties (SELECTED)

**Policy**: 20%/30%/50% penalties based on lateness, portfolio exempt

**Selected because**:
1. Balances flexibility with accountability
2. Incentivizes timeliness without punishing emergencies
3. Partial credit better than zero for equity
4. Reflects pedagogical value of timely engagement
5. Portfolio exemption allows recovery

## Evidence & Iteration

### Evidence to Collect

To assess whether late work policy achieves goals:

- [ ] **Late submission patterns**: What percentage of work is submitted late? Which students?
- [ ] **Penalty impact analysis**: How do late penalties affect different student populations?
- [ ] **Grade correlation**: Does late work predict lower portfolio scores? Or do some students recover?
- [ ] **Student survey**: Do students find policy fair? Too harsh? Too lenient?
- [ ] **Peer review quality**: Does late work submission correlate with lower helpfulness ratings (fewer peers to review)?
- [ ] **Extension requests**: How often? For what reasons? Which students?

### Revision Notes

**If too many students submitting late (>40% of assignments)**:
- Revisit deadline timing (are they realistic given workload?)
- Increase reminders and time management support
- Consider whether penalties are severe enough to incentivize timeliness

**If late penalties disproportionately affect certain student groups**:
- Examine structural barriers (work schedules, family obligations, health issues)
- Increase flexibility mechanisms (more dropped assignments, extension options)
- Partner with Dean of Students for systemic support

**If peer review suffers due to late submissions**:
- Consider making peer review completion-based regardless of partner's lateness
- Build in backup review assignments if peer submits late
- Increase communication about collaborative responsibility

**If portfolio scores don't correlate with formative engagement**:
- Question whether late penalties on formative work are pedagogically meaningful
- Consider reducing formative weight or increasing portfolio weight
- Investigate whether students can "game" system by focusing only on portfolio
