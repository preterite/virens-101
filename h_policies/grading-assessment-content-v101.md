## Policy Statement

### Policy Text

This course rewards sustained engagement with writing processes. Your grade reflects both the quality of your final portfolio and your consistent participation in the daily work of the course.

**Grade Distribution Philosophy:**

Students who **attend regularly, complete all work on time, engage thoughtfully with feedback, and submit a complete portfolio** will earn grades in the **B-range (83-89%)**. 

Students who **complete work with minimal engagement or submit work late** will earn grades in the **C-range (70-82%)**.

Students whose **portfolios demonstrate exceptional command of course outcomes** will earn grades in the **A-range (90-100%)**.

**Justification**: [[grading-assessment-reasons-v101#Policy Rationale|Why this policy?]]

## Grade Breakdown

### Portfolio: 50%

Your final portfolio, submitted at the end of the semester, is assessed holistically using rubrics aligned with all seven course learning outcomes. The portfolio must include:

- **Polished final pieces** (selected from your accumulated fragments and revised through multiple cycles)
- **Process evidence** (drafts showing revision, peer feedback you received)
- **Reflective cover letter** (arguing for your grade based on documented evidence)

**Portfolio submissions are exempt from late work penalties** - the portfolio is due at the end of the semester as specified in the course calendar.

### Formative Work: 50%

The other half of your grade comes from consistent engagement throughout the semester:

| Component | Percentage | Description |
|-----------|------------|-------------|
| **Fragment Accumulation** | 15% | Building your textual corpus across the semester |
| **Revision & Feedback** | 20% | Engaging with peer review and reflecting on revisions |
| **Process Documentation** | 10% | Maintaining workflow logs and system maps |
| **Attendance & Participation** | 5% | Daily engagement with course activities |

**Detailed breakdown below.**

## Formative Work Components

### Fragment Accumulation: 15%

**Target:** 40-50 textual fragments by Week 12

**Breakdown:**
- **Fragment completion (12%):** Reach the 40-50 fragment target by Week 12
  - Fragments must meet minimum standards: 150-400 words, contain one claim with supporting evidence
  - Submitted on time through your OneDrive folder structure
- **Quality baseline (3%):** Instructor spot-checks random fragments for genuine engagement
  - Fragments show effort to develop ideas, not placeholder text
  - Fragments demonstrate engagement with course concepts

**What counts as a fragment:**
- Daily in-class writing
- Response to readings
- Exploratory drafting
- Source analysis using BEAM framework
- Constraint experiments
- Revision attempts

**What doesn't count:**
- Fragments under 150 words (unless instructor approves specific exercise)
- Fragments without identifiable claim + evidence
- Duplicate submissions

### Revision & Feedback: 20%

**Peer Review via Eli Review (10%):**
- Complete all assigned peer review cycles on time
- Provide helpful, substantive feedback to peers
- Eli Review tracks completion and helpfulness metrics
- **No late submissions accepted** - peer review cycles close when scheduled

**Reflective One-Pagers (10%):**
- Four reflective one-pagers due on "publication days" (end of major revision cycles)
- Due at midnight on the assignment due date (you may draft during class on due date)
- Each one-pager worth 2.5% of final grade

**What reflective one-pagers must include:**
- Specific feedback you received from peers or instructor
- Specific revisions you made in response to feedback
- Analysis of what you learned from the revision cycle
- Discussion of what you would do differently next time

These one-pagers become raw material for your portfolio cover letter.

### Process Documentation: 10%

**Workflow Logs (7%):**
- Write brief workflow logs 2× per week (approximately 30 total across semester)
- Simple completion-based: Did you write it? Y/N
- Format: What I did / What happened / What I learned
- Logs demonstrate consistent engagement with writing process

**System Maps (3%):**
- Draft system map in Week 3
- Revised system map in final portfolio
- Maps visualize your writing infrastructure, tools, and organizational strategies

### Attendance & Participation: 5%

**Daily Participation Quizzes:**
- Short quizzes administered most class meetings (approximately 40 total)
- **Lowest 10 quiz grades dropped** (effectively 1.5 weeks of "free" absences)
- Quiz format:
  - Question 1: Enter "word of the day" shown on board at start of class
  - Question 2 (exit ticket): "What about today's class was Memorable, Muddy, or made you want to know More?"
- Keep quiz open throughout class period

**Quizzes cannot be made up** - they verify presence and engagement during class.

## Late Work Policy

### Late Submission Penalties

Work submitted after the due date receives the following grade reductions:

| Lateness | Penalty |
|----------|---------|
| Less than 1 week late | 20% reduction |
| 1-2 weeks late | 30% reduction |
| More than 2 weeks late | 50% reduction |

**What these penalties apply to:**
- Fragments (for fragment accumulation credit)
- Reflective one-pagers
- Process documentation (workflow logs, system maps)

**Exemptions from late penalties:**
- **Portfolio:** No late penalty (due at end of semester)
- **Peer review in Eli:** No late submissions accepted (cycles close on schedule)
- **Daily quizzes:** Cannot be made up (require presence)

### Why This Policy?

In a course with accelerated production, review, and feedback cycles, late work creates challenges:

1. **Peer review dependency:** Late fragments miss their peer review cycles - you lose the opportunity for feedback
2. **Instructor feedback capacity:** Late work submitted close to deadlines may not receive detailed instructor feedback for revision
3. **Incremental progress:** The course design assumes you're building a corpus progressively; catching up at the end is difficult

**The policy is designed to help you stay on track while allowing recovery if you fall behind.**

### Grace Period: The Drop Policy

Your lowest 10 daily quiz grades are dropped, giving you approximately 1.5 weeks of "free" absences throughout the semester for illness, emergencies, or personal needs. Use this grace period wisely.

## Implementation

### Communication

**Week 1:** Full grading breakdown presented in syllabus and discussed in class

- Quizzes: Check Canvas (remember: lowest 10 dropped)

**Portfolio (50%):** Assessed at end of semester

### Exceptions & Flexibility

## Student Support

### Resources

**Canvas Gradebook:** Check anytime to see current standing

**Office Hours:** Discuss your progress, get feedback on portfolio plans, ask questions about grading

**Mid-Semester Check-In (Week 8):** Individual grade reports showing progress toward targets

**Peer Review in Eli:** Provides ongoing feedback on your writing before formal grading

**Reflective One-Pagers:** Help you track what you're learning and prepare portfolio cover letter

### Common Questions

**Q: What if I'm falling behind on fragments?**<br/>
**A:** Come to office hours ASAP. We can discuss strategies for catching up, but remember that late fragments (a) receive grade penalties and (b) may miss peer review cycles.

**Q: Can I submit reflective one-pagers late?**<br/>
**A:** Yes, with late penalties: 20% reduction if less than 1 week late, 30% if 1-2 weeks late, 50% if more than 2 weeks late. However, they're most useful when completed on time because they help you process feedback while it's fresh.

**Q: I missed a peer review cycle in Eli. Can I make it up?**<br/>
**A:** No. Peer review cycles close on schedule because they depend on synchronous groups. Missing a cycle means 0 for that cycle. Plan ahead and prioritize peer review deadlines.

**Q: What grade do I get if I complete all the work?**<br/>
**A:** If you complete all work on time, engage thoughtfully with feedback, and submit a competent portfolio, you'll earn in the B-range (83-89%). A-range grades require exceptional portfolio work that demonstrates sophisticated command of course outcomes.

**Q: How do I know if my portfolio is "exceptional"?**<br/>
**A:** Your reflective cover letter should argue for your grade using evidence from your portfolio. Exceptional portfolios show: sophisticated understanding of all seven course outcomes, evidence of substantial revision informed by feedback, metacognitive awareness of your growth as a writer, and polished final products that meet professional standards.

**Q: What if I have a DRS accommodation?**<br/>
**A:** Please schedule a meeting with me in the first two weeks of the semester so we can discuss how to implement your accommodations in the context of this course's structure.
