## Design Philosophy

### Core Pedagogical Principle

Withdrawal policy should **support informed student decision-making** rather than create barriers or shame. While withdrawal is governed by university regulations (not instructor control), the course policy's role is to (a) direct students to accurate information, (b) encourage consultation before withdrawing, and (c) present alternatives when appropriate.

The policy treats withdrawal as **sometimes necessary, not as failure**. Life circumstances, mismatched expectations, or insurmountable barriers can make withdrawal the responsible choice. The policy's purpose is ensuring students make that choice with full information about implications and alternatives.

### Theoretical Grounding

**Student Retention and Success:**
- High withdrawal rates signal systemic problems (unclear expectations, inadequate support)
- But preventing withdrawal through pressure or barriers doesn't improve learning
- Goal is informed choice, not retention at all costs

**Key Concept:**
- **Advising relationship**: Instructor provides honest assessment and explores options
- **Student agency**: Final decision belongs to student
- **Growth mindset**: Withdrawal is data point, not character judgment

## Policy Rationale

### Purpose & Goals

**What this policy accomplishes:**
1. **Clarifies university procedures**: Directs students to official deadlines, processes
2. **Encourages consultation**: Asks students to discuss with instructor before withdrawing
3. **Presents alternatives**: Incomplete grades, late work, modified timelines
4. **Acknowledges financial implications**: Connects students to Financial Aid, Veterans Services
5. **Reduces stigma**: Frames withdrawal as sometimes appropriate, not moral failure

**Why primarily point to university resources:**
- Withdrawal governed by university policy, not course policy
- Deadlines and procedures change semester-to-semester
- Financial aid, visa status, veteran's benefits require specialized knowledge
- Course policy can't comprehensively cover all scenarios

**Why encourage instructor consultation:**
- Students often don't know current grade or whether they can recover
- Instructor can explain course-specific options (late work, portfolio focus)
- Early conversation prevents hasty decisions based on incomplete information

---

## Advising Role

### Why Instructor Consultation Matters

**What instructor knows that student may not:**

1. **Current grade**: Students often think they're further behind than they are
2. **Recovery potential**: Portfolio structure allows recovery from weak formative work
3. **Course-specific options**: Late work, incomplete, focusing on remaining assignments
4. **Relative standing**: Student doing "badly" might still be passing or close

**What instructor can provide:**

**Honest assessment:**
- "You're currently at 62%, but strong portfolio could bring you to 75% (C)"
- "You've missed too much to pass; withdrawal is better than F"

**Strategic advice:**
- "Focus on portfolio—formative work already completed counts"
- "Submit late fragments with penalties—still better than zero"

**Resource connection:**
- "Have you talked to CAPS about anxiety affecting attendance?"
- "Financial Aid can explain how this affects your scholarship"

**Why this matters:**
Prevents students from withdrawing when they could pass OR staying when they'll fail. Informed decision benefits student either way.

**Research base:**
- Braxton [[@braxton2004under]], John M., Amy S. Hirschy, and Shederick A. McClendon. *Understanding and Reducing College Student Departure*. Jossey-Bass, 2004.
  - Faculty-student interaction correlates with retention, but only when meaningful (not just procedural)

## University Procedures

### Why Policy Points to Official Sources

**Withdrawal deadlines change:**
- Semester calendar varies (16-week fall/spring vs. summer terms)
- University occasionally adjusts deadlines in response to crises (pandemic, etc.)
- Course policy with specific dates would be immediately outdated

**Procedures are standardized:**
- Withdrawal process same across all courses
- Dean of Students handles late withdrawal petitions uniformly
- No course-specific variations

**Specialized knowledge required:**
- Financial aid implications complex (Pell grants, loans, scholarships all have different rules)
- International student visa status governed by federal regulations
- Veteran's education benefits require VA compliance

**Why course policy stays high-level:**
- Directs students to expert resources
- Avoids providing outdated or incorrect information
- Instructor not qualified to advise on financial aid, visa status, etc.

## Incomplete Philosophy

### When Incompletes Serve Learning

**Incompletes appropriate when:**
- Student engaged consistently until crisis hit
- Substantial work completed (75%+)
- Student can reasonably finish within extension period
- Crisis is genuinely beyond student's control (illness, family emergency)

**Incompletes inappropriate when:**
- Student chronically disengaged (incomplete delays inevitable F)
- Minimal work completed (need to retake course, not finish this one)
- Student unlikely to complete (past pattern suggests won't follow through)
- "Crisis" is poor time management

**Why 75% threshold:**
- Demonstrates student was on track before crisis
- Ensures extension won't require repeating entire semester
- Completion contract manageable (typically just portfolio)

**Research base:**
- Connelly [[@connelly2013cours]], Anne, and Katelynn Ryan. "The Course Incomplete: A Necessary Option or a Hindering Crutch?" *Journal of the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning* 13.1 (2013): 107-114.
  - Incompletes effective when truly temporary crisis; problematic when used to delay failure

**Implementation in this course:**
Most incomplete contracts require:
- Completing portfolio (including cover letter)
- Submitting any missing reflective one-pagers
- Process documentation for work completed during extension

Fragments and peer reviews already completed count toward grade. Extension focuses on synthesizing existing work into portfolio.

## Financial Considerations

### Why Financial Implications Matter

**Withdrawal affects more than transcript:**

**Financial aid:**
- Pell Grant: Withdrawal might trigger repayment if you don't complete minimum percentage of enrolled credits
- Student loans: Same issue; dropping below half-time might trigger repayment
- Scholarships: Many require minimum GPA AND continuous enrollment
- Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP): Multiple withdrawals can put you on financial aid probation

**Tuition:**
- Early withdrawal = partial refund
- Late withdrawal = owe full tuition
- Students may not realize no refund after Week 3-4

**Degree progress:**
- Withdrawing delays graduation
- May extend borrowing, cost additional tuition later
- ENGL 101 is prerequisite for many other courses

**Policy's role:**
Direct students to Financial Aid Office BEFORE withdrawing so they understand financial consequences. Instructor can't provide this advising (not qualified), but can emphasize importance of checking.

## Alternative Pathways

### Supporting Completion Over Withdrawal

**Course structure offers multiple recovery paths:**

**1. Late work with penalties**
- Better to submit late with 50% penalty than get 0
- Penalties are graduated, not catastrophic

**2. Portfolio focus**
- Formative work already completed still counts (50% of grade)
- Strong portfolio (50% of grade) can compensate for weaker formative work
- Students closer to passing than they think if they've been attending/writing

**3. Quiz grace period**
- 10 dropped quizzes = 25% forgiveness on attendance
- Students who think they're "failing due to absences" might actually be okay

**4. Peer review recovery**
- Missing one peer review cycle isn't fatal
- Can focus on remaining cycles to bring average up

**When alternatives don't help:**
If student has completed <50% of work, missed most peer review cycles, and has minimal fragments, withdrawal or incomplete likely necessary. But for student who's engaged but struggling, alternatives exist.

**Research base:**
- Tinto [[@tinto1993leavi]], Vincent. *Leaving College: Rethinking the Causes and Cures of Student Attrition*. 2nd ed. U of Chicago P, 1993.
  - Students leave when they feel they can't succeed; providing pathways to success reduces attrition

## Learning from Withdrawal

### Growth Mindset Approach

**If student withdraws, policy encourages reflection:**

**Questions to consider:**
- What made this semester difficult?
- What would you do differently if you retake?
- Do you need accommodations (DRS) or support services (CAPS, tutoring)?
- Is fall vs. spring vs. summer better timing for you?

**Why this matters:**
Withdrawal isn't end of story. Most students retaking ENGL 101 after withdrawal do better second time because they:
- Know what to expect (no longer surprised by workload)
- Have addressed underlying issues (got ADHD diagnosed, reduced work hours, etc.)
- Start strong instead of catching up

**Policy frames withdrawal as learning opportunity:**
Not "you failed"
But "this didn't work; what will you do differently next time?"

**Research base:**
- Dweck [[@dweck2006minds]], Carol S. *Mindset: The New Psychology of Success*. Random House, 2006.
  - Growth mindset treats setbacks as information, not character flaws

---

## Crisis Support

### University Safety Net

**Emergency withdrawal policies exist for reason:**
Sometimes crises make course completion impossible (hospitalization, family death, housing loss).

**University response:**
- Dean of Students coordinates emergency support
- Can facilitate withdrawal from all courses
- Connects student to campus resources (food pantry, emergency housing, counseling)

**Course policy's role:**
Point students to Dean of Students if facing crisis. Instructor can't solve housing crisis or provide therapy, but can connect student to those who can.

**Why this matters:**
Students in crisis often don't know support exists. Course withdrawal policy is opportunity to make them aware.

---

## Instructor Limitations

### Role Boundaries

**What instructor can do:**
- Assess current grade and recovery potential
- Explain course-specific options
- Sign withdrawal forms
- Write incomplete contracts
- Refer to appropriate resources

**What instructor cannot do:**
- Override university withdrawal deadlines
- Make financial aid decisions
- Grant late withdrawal (only Dean can)
- Provide medical or mental health treatment
- Solve housing, food, transportation crises

**Why boundaries matter:**
Students sometimes see instructor as one-stop problem solver. Clarifying role boundaries helps students get to appropriate resources faster.

**Ethical consideration:**
Instructor should not pressure student to stay in course if withdrawal is appropriate. "I want you to succeed" doesn't mean "I want you to stay in my class regardless of circumstances."

---

## Known Tensions

### Potential Issues

**Issue**: Student withdraws impulsively without checking grade or considering alternatives
**Response**: Policy encourages "talk to me first" but can't prevent hasty decisions. If student withdraws without consulting, instructor can email with current grade and "if you reconsider withdrawal, here's your standing."

**Issue**: Student stays too long, fails when withdrawal would've been better
**Response**: Proactive mid-semester check-in (Week 8) identifies at-risk students. Instructor can initiate "let's discuss your options" conversation rather than waiting for student to ask.

**Issue**: Incomplete contract not completed; I becomes F
**Response**: Set realistic completion timeline. Follow up at midpoint of extension period. If student not making progress, contact again to discuss whether to complete or accept F.

**Issue**: Financial aid consequences not understood until too late
**Response**: Policy emphasizes "talk to Financial Aid BEFORE withdrawing" in bold/caps. Can't force students to consult, but making warning prominent reduces risk.

## Evidence & Iteration

### Evidence to Collect

**Withdrawal patterns**:
- [ ] How many students withdraw from course each semester?
- [ ] When do most withdrawals occur (early vs. late)?
- [ ] Do students consult instructor before withdrawing?
- [ ] How many students granted incompletes? How many complete?

**Outcomes**:
- [ ] For students who withdrew: Do they retake ENGL 101? Do they pass second time?
- [ ] For students granted incompletes: Completion rate? Final grades?
- [ ] For students who considered withdrawal but stayed: Did they pass? Was staying the right choice?

**Equity indicators**:
- [ ] Are withdrawal rates higher for specific populations (first-gen, low-income, students of color)?
- [ ] If so, why? Lack of support? Mismatched expectations? Financial barriers?

### Revision Notes

**Based on piloting, consider adjusting:**
- **Incomplete threshold**: If too many incompletes not completed, raise threshold to 85% work done (instead of 75%)
- **Consultation requirement**: If students withdrawing without talking to instructor, require email confirmation "I understand my current grade and options"
- **Proactive outreach**: If at-risk students not seeking help, increase mid-semester check-ins
- **Alternative pathways**: If many students unaware of recovery options, add "recovery plan" conference opportunity
