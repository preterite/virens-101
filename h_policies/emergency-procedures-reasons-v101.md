## Design Philosophy

### Core Pedagogical Principle

Emergency procedures policy should **point students to authoritative resources** (WSU Office of Emergency Management) while providing **classroom-specific context** (evacuation routes from our room, where to hide in active threat). The policy emphasizes **preparedness reduces panic**: students who know protocols respond more effectively in emergencies.

This policy is **primarily compliance-driven** (university requires it) but serves genuine safety purpose. The instructor's role is ensuring students know (a) university-wide protocols, (b) building-specific procedures, and (c) classroom-specific details that only instructor can provide.

### Theoretical Grounding

**Safety and Learning:**
- Maslow's hierarchy: Safety is foundational need; students can't focus on learning if they feel unsafe
- Predictable environments (including emergency procedures) reduce anxiety

**Key Principle:**
- **Preparedness, not paranoia**: Information empowers, but over-focus on rare dangers creates climate of fear
- Policy provides essential information without dwelling on worst-case scenarios

---

## Policy Rationale

### Purpose & Goals

**What this policy accomplishes:**
1. **University compliance**: Meets WSU requirement for emergency procedures in syllabi
2. **Student preparedness**: Students know what to do if emergency occurs
3. **Reduces panic**: Practiced procedures prevent chaos in crisis
4. **Resource awareness**: Students know where to find detailed information (OEM website)
5. **Classroom specificity**: Evacuation routes, hiding places, etc. for our specific room

**Why point to university resources:**
- Emergency protocols change (university updates based on training, incidents)
- Detailed procedures (100+ pages) don't belong in syllabus
- Authoritative source (OEM) more reliable than instructor summary

---

## Alert System

### Why Enrollment Matters

**WSU Alert system:**
- Text, email, phone notifications for campus emergencies
- Only works if students enroll and keep contact info current
- Takes 2-3 minutes to enroll via myWSU

**Historical precedent:**
Active shooter situations at other universities show communication failures when students not enrolled in alert systems or alerts sent too late.

**Policy emphasizes enrollment because:**
- Many students don't know system exists
- Default enrollment often uses outdated contact info
- Students responsible for adding mobile numbers

---

## Active Threat

### Preparedness Reduces Panic

**Run, Hide, Fight protocol:**
- Research-based (FBI, Department of Homeland Security)
- Prioritizes escape over confrontation
- Provides decision framework in chaotic situation

**Why classroom-specific orientation:**
- Generic protocol not enough: students need to know *where* exits are, *where* to hide in *this* room
- 10 minutes Week 1 orientation familiarizes students with space

**Instructor's role:**
- Walk through evacuation routes
- Identify best hiding spots (behind large desks, away from door sightlines)
- Discuss improvised barriers (desks, chairs)

**Research base:**
- After-action reports from campus shootings show students who knew exits/hiding spots had better survival outcomes
- Practiced procedures reduce decision paralysis

---

## Evacuation Protocol

### Building-Specific Procedures

**Why evacuation plan matters:**
- Fire alarms, hazmat incidents, bomb threats all require evacuation
- Students unfamiliar with building don't know secondary exits
- Mobility-impaired students need planned assistance

**Instructor responsibilities:**
- Know primary and secondary evacuation routes
- Identify assembly point (100+ feet from building, upwind if hazmat)
- Establish buddy system for students with mobility needs

**Accessibility planning:**
- Elevators unavailable during emergencies
- Students who can't use stairs need stairwell refuge areas
- 911 dispatcher needs exact location to send rescue personnel

**Research base:**
- ADA compliance requires evacuation planning for disabled students
- Buddy system proven effective in ensuring no one left behind

---

## Medical Response

### Life-Threatening vs. Urgent

**Policy distinguishes:**
- **Call 911**: Life-threatening (unconscious, not breathing, severe bleeding, chest pain)
- **Cougar Health Services**: Urgent but not immediately life-threatening (sprained ankle, flu, moderate injury)

**Why this matters:**
- 911 resources finite; misuse delays response to true emergencies
- Students often unsure when to call 911 vs. seek clinic care

**Instructor's role:**
- Call 911 if student loses consciousness, has chest pain, severe allergic reaction, etc.
- Stay with student until help arrives
- Send runner to meet EMS at building entrance (speeds response)

**First aid limitations:**
- Instructors not required to provide first aid (Good Samaritan laws protect, but not obligated)
- CPR/AED only if trained and comfortable
- Primary role: call for help, keep student safe until professionals arrive

---

## Mental Health Emergency

### De-stigmatizing Crisis Response

**Why explicit mental health section:**
- Suicide is leading cause of death for college students
- Students often unsure how to help suicidal friend (don't want to overreact or make it worse)
- Policy normalizes crisis response: better to call 988 and be wrong than not call and lose someone

**Crisis vs. non-crisis:**
- **Crisis**: Immediate risk of harm (suicidal plan, self-injury, psychosis)
- **Non-crisis**: Struggling but safe (depression, anxiety, grief)

**Policy provides both:**
- Crisis resources (988, WSU Police)
- Non-crisis resources (CAPS, Student Care Network)

**Research base:**
- Gatekeeper training research: Peers who know how to respond to suicidal ideation save lives
- Reducing stigma increases help-seeking behavior

---

## Weather Preparedness

### Regional Specificity

**Pullman climate:**
- Heavy snow (30-50 inches annual) but campus rarely closes
- Extreme cold (wind chill -20°F possible)
- Tornadoes rare but possible (eastern Washington occasionally gets them)

**Why weather in syllabus:**
- Out-of-state students unfamiliar with high-desert cold
- International students may come from climates without snow/cold
- Frostbite and hypothermia real risks

**Policy approach:**
- Dress in layers for winter
- Check WSU Alert for rare closures
- If unsafe to travel, email instructor (we'll work it out)

**Regional contrast:**
Policies in other climates would emphasize different weather risks (hurricanes, extreme heat, wildfires).

---

## Low-Probability Events

### Preparedness Despite Low Risk

**Earthquakes in Pullman:**
- Low seismic zone (not on major fault)
- Rare but possible (1936 M6.1 Milton-Freewater earthquake felt in Pullman)
- Drop-Cover-Hold still appropriate response

**Why include despite low probability:**
- Takes 30 seconds to explain
- If earthquake does occur, prepared students respond correctly
- Cost of inclusion minimal; benefit potentially life-saving

**Policy approach:**
- Brief, factual, not fear-inducing
- Standard earthquake protocol (applies anywhere)

---

## Building Context

### Space-Appropriate Response

**Standard classroom vs. lab:**
- This course meets in standard classroom (no chemicals, gas lines, hazardous equipment)
- Hazmat emergencies unlikely but possible (adjacent labs, maintenance areas)
- Policy reflects building context (generic evacuation plan, not lab-specific decontamination)

**If course met in different space:**
- Computer lab: Electrical fire risk higher
- Chemistry lab: Hazmat procedures more detailed
- Outdoor space: Weather considerations, no evacuation plan needed

---

## Contingency Planning

### Communication Protocols

**When class can't meet:**
- University closure (WSU Alert)
- Building closure (email)
- Instructor absence (email)

**Why explicit communication plan:**
- Students waste time arriving at closed building if not notified
- Clear "wait 15 minutes" rule prevents confusion
- Email backup ensures communication even if Canvas down

**Historically:**
- Power outages occasionally cancel classes
- Rare but occasional water main breaks or HVAC failures
- Instructor illness/emergency

---

## Student Agency

### Empowering Preparedness

**Individual responsibility:**
- Enroll in WSU Alert (university can't do it for you)
- Know evacuation routes (walk them yourself if instructor doesn't show)
- Save emergency numbers (don't assume you'll remember them in crisis)

**Mutual aid:**
- Buddy system for mobility-impaired classmates
- Help others evacuate when safe
- Check on classmates after emergency

**Why emphasize student role:**
- Instructor can't guarantee they'll be present during every emergency (could happen before/after class, when instructor off campus)
- Prepared students can respond even without instructor leadership

---

## Classroom-Specific Orientation

### Context Matters

**10-minute Week 1 orientation:**
- Walk to exits (primary and secondary)
- Note location of assembly point outside
- Discuss hiding places if Run-Hide-Fight scenario
- Show fire alarm locations, AED cabinet

**Why classroom-specific:**
- Generic university protocols insufficient
- Building layout varies
- Our room's exits, hiding spots, evacuation route unique

**Instructor preparation:**
- Walk evacuation routes before semester starts
- Identify safe assembly point
- Note accessibility considerations (stairs, heavy doors, etc.)

---

## Known Tensions

### Potential Issues

**Issue**: Student doesn't take orientation seriously (jokes during Run-Hide-Fight explanation)
**Response**: Acknowledge discomfort (gallows humor is coping mechanism) but emphasize seriousness. Frame as "hope we never need this, but if we do..."

**Issue**: Student with trauma related to violence triggered by active threat discussion
**Response**: Content warning Week 1 ("We'll spend 5 minutes on active threat procedures—if this is difficult for you, you can step out"). Offer to discuss individually. CAPS referral if needed.

**Issue**: Student wants more detailed emergency training (first aid, etc.)
**Response**: Point to WSU resources: CPR/first aid classes through Cougar Health Services, emergency preparedness workshops through OEM. Instructor role is basic orientation, not comprehensive training.

---

## Evidence & Iteration

### Evidence to Collect

**Preparedness**:
- [ ] Post-orientation quiz: Students can identify evacuation routes, know WSU Alert exists, know when to call 911?
- [ ] WSU Alert enrollment: What percentage of class enrolled by Week 2?

**Actual incidents**:
- [ ] If fire drill occurs, how did students respond? (Did they evacuate promptly? Go to assembly point?)
- [ ] If medical emergency occurred, was 911 called appropriately?

**Climate impact**:
- [ ] End-of-semester survey: Did emergency procedures policy make students feel more/less safe?

### Revision Notes

**Based on piloting, consider adjusting:**
- **Orientation timing**: If Week 1 too busy, move to Week 2 (but don't delay past Week 2)
- **Content depth**: If students want more detail, add optional OEM workshop attendance for extra credit
- **Accessibility**: If students with mobility needs need more planning time, initiate conversations earlier (first week, not waiting for them to approach)
