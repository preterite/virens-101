## Design Philosophy

### Core Pedagogical Principle

Technology should **support learning, not drive it**. This course uses proven, accessible tools that serve the pedagogical goals (accumulation, iteration, peer feedback, process documentation) rather than adding complexity for technology's sake. The tech stack prioritizes **cross-platform compatibility, minimal learning curve, and low cost** over innovation.

The policy distinguishes between **technology-as-tool** (laptops for writing, Zotero for citations) and **technology-as-distraction** (social media, entertainment). It teaches students to manage attention in digital environments—a transferable skill beyond this course.

###Theoretical Grounding

**Tool Selection Philosophy:**
- Norman [[@norman2013desig]], Donald. *The Design of Everyday Things*. Basic Books, 2013.
  - Good tools disappear into use; bad tools draw attention to themselves
- Course tools chosen for transparency and learnability

**Digital Distraction Research:**
- Mueller & Oppenheimer (2014): Laptops can impair learning when used for non-course activities
- Policy acknowledges risk while supporting legitimate use

**Concepts Applied:**
- **Constraint sequencing**: Introduce tools when needed, not all at once
- **Just-in-time learning**: Tech instruction happens as students need it
- **Proven over innovative**: Prioritize stable, widely-adopted tools over cutting-edge

---

## Policy Rationale

### Purpose & Goals

**What this policy accomplishes:**
1. **Clarity on requirements**: Students know exactly what they need and what it costs
2. **Supports learning**: Tech enables course activities (peer review, fragment accumulation)
3. **Manages distractions**: Sets expectations for appropriate use
4. **Ensures access**: Low cost, free alternatives, equity provisions
5. **Realistic expectations**: 5 hours tech learning time across semester

**Why explicit cost breakdown:**
- Students (and parents) deserve to know course costs upfront
- Low-income students can plan budget or seek assistance
- Transparency builds trust

---

## Tool Selection

### Why These Specific Tools

**Index cards (analog):**
- **Pedagogical**: Forces concision, enables physical sorting/connecting, tactile engagement
- **Practical**: Portable, never run out of battery, accessible to all
- **Cognitive**: Handwriting activates different cognitive pathways than typing
- **Research**: Mueller & Oppenheimer (2014) show handwriting benefits conceptual understanding

**Microsoft OneDrive/Word:**
- **Accessibility**: Free with WSU account (zero additional cost)
- **Familiarity**: Most students already know Word basics
- **Collaboration**: Real-time co-authoring for peer review, portfolio assembly
- **Industry standard**: Transferable to workplace
- **Cloud sync**: Work accessible from any device
- **Rejected alternatives**: Google Docs (privacy concerns, formatting inconsistencies); LibreOffice (compatibility issues)

**Zotero:**
- **Cost**: Free core software; optional $20/year storage
- **Industry standard**: Most widely used academic citation manager
- **Open source**: Won't disappear if company folds
- **Cross-platform**: Works on Windows, Mac, Linux, web
- **Transferable**: Students will use in future courses, grad school
- **Rejected alternatives**: EndNote (expensive, proprietary); Mendeley (Elsevier-owned, privacy concerns)

**Eli Review:**
- **Pedagogical**: Structured peer review with Describe-Evaluate-Suggest [[@elireview2025givi]] framework
- **Analytics**: Instructor sees helpfulness ratings, completion rates
- **Asynchronous**: Students review on their schedule within deadline window
- **Cost**: $10 for semester (comparable to textbook chapter)
- **Rejected alternatives**: Canvas peer review (clunky, no analytics); pure discussion forums (unstructured, hard to track)

**Canvas:**
- **Required**: WSU's official LMS (no choice)
- **Functional**: Adequate for posting readings, collecting assignments
- **Familiar**: Students use it in all courses

**Design principle**: Choose boring, proven technology that works reliably over exciting, innovative technology that might break.

## Classroom Device Policy

### Research on Laptops and Learning

**Evidence of benefit:**
- Typing faster than handwriting enables more fluent idea generation
- In-class writing is core activity in this course
- Digital text enables peer review, revision, portfolio assembly

**Evidence of risk:**
- Mueller, Pam A., and Daniel M. Oppenheimer. "The Pen Is Mightier Than the Keyboard." *Psychological Science* 25.6 (2014): 1159-1168.
  - Laptop note-taking correlates with shallower processing than longhand
- Sana, Faria, Tina Weston, and Nicholas J. Cepeda. "Laptop Multitasking Hinders Classroom Learning for Both Users and Nearby Peers." *Computers & Education* 62 (2013): 24-31.
  - Laptops distract both user and those seated nearby

**Policy resolution:**
- Permit laptops because course requires digital writing
- Set expectations for appropriate use
- Address misuse individually rather than ban entirely
- Provide analog alternative (index cards) for those who prefer

**Why not laptop-free zones:**
- Some students need assistive technology (screen readers, alternative keyboards)
- Banning laptops punishes responsible users for others' misuse
- Teaching attention management more valuable than enforcing bans

---

## Attention Management

### Why It Matters

**Cognitive science on attention:**
- Multitasking is myth; brain switches between tasks (costly in time and cognitive load)
- Each notification/distraction requires ~23 minutes to regain full focus (Gloria Mark research)
- Sustained attention is learned skill, not innate ability

**Application to course:**
- In-class writing requires sustained focus (25-30 minute blocks)
- Fragmented attention produces lower-quality writing
- Students benefit from practicing attention management

**Policy approach:**
- Teach strategies (Do Not Disturb, full-screen mode, closed tabs)
- Normalize struggles with attention (it's hard for everyone)
- Offer alternatives (analog writing) for those who need them

**Research base:**
- Carr, Nicholas. *The Shallows: What the Internet Is Doing to Our Brains*. Norton, 2010.
  - Digital environments train for distraction; sustained focus requires active resistance

---

## Phone Policy

### Why Put Phones Away

**Research on phone presence:**
- Ward et al. (2017): Mere presence of phone reduces cognitive capacity, even when turned off
- "Brain drain" effect: Part of working memory monitoring for notifications
- Phones on desk create temptation to check

**Policy logic:**
- Out of sight = reduced temptation and cognitive load
- Use phone as tool (timer, dictionary) rather than passive presence

**Exceptions:**
- Assistive technology needs
- Legitimate emergencies (step outside to handle)
- Course activities requiring phones (rare)

**Research base:**
- Ward, Adrian F., et al. "Brain Drain: The Mere Presence of One's Own Smartphone Reduces Available Cognitive Capacity." *Journal of the Association for Consumer Research* 2.2 (2017): 140-154.

---

## Equity Considerations

### Ensuring Access for All

**Assumptions course does NOT make:**
- Everyone owns a laptop
- Everyone has reliable home internet
- Everyone can afford $35 for software
- Everyone has same tech literacy level

**Provisions for access:**
- All required software free or minimal cost (<$35 total)
- WSU library checkout laptops (short-term and semester-long)
- Campus computer labs (free access)
- Instructor discretionary fund for students facing financial hardship

**Why this matters:**
- First-generation students less likely to have home computers
- Low-income students may rely on phone-only internet access
- International students may face additional software costs (currency conversion, regional pricing)

**Research base:**
- Goldrick-Rab, Sara. *Paying the Price: College Costs, Financial Aid, and the Betrayal of the American Dream*. U of Chicago P, 2016.
  - Hidden course costs (technology, materials) create barriers for low-income students

---

## Learning Investment

### Time Cost-Benefit

**5 hours across semester for tech learning is reasonable because:**

**Cost:**
- ~3% of total course time (5 hours / ~150 total hours)
- Front-loaded (most in Weeks 1-3)
- Minimal ongoing maintenance

**Benefit:**
- Tools transferable to other courses (Zotero, Word collaboration)
- Skills transferable to workplace (citation management, cloud collaboration)
- Efficiency gains compound over semester (OneDrive auto-save prevents lost work; Zotero speeds up bibliography generation)

**Alternative considered:**
No-tech course (paper only, in-person peer review, handwritten portfolios)
- **Rejected because**: Reduces accessibility (no cloud backup, hard to revise), limits collaboration, doesn't prepare students for digital academic work

---

## Support Infrastructure

### Empowering Self-Help

**Why teach troubleshooting:**
- Instructor can't be 24/7 tech support
- Students benefit from learning to solve own problems
- "Help yourself first" is transferable skill

**Policy provides:**
- Common issues and solutions (troubleshooting guide)
- Links to official support channels (IT, Canvas help, Zotero forums)
- Clear boundaries (when to contact instructor vs. support)

**When to provide direct help:**
- Course-specific tech issues (Canvas assignments, Eli access)
- Student has exhausted self-help and official support
- Systemic issues affecting multiple students

**When to refer to support:**
- WSU account/software issues (IT's domain)
- Third-party software technical problems (vendor support)
- Hardware failures (not instructor's role to fix)

---

## Optional Tools

### Supporting Exploration

**Why not require more sophisticated tools:**
- Steep learning curve doesn't serve course goals
- Not all students will use tools beyond this course
- Cost and access barriers

**Why mention optional tools:**
- Advanced students want to explore
- Some tools genuinely helpful for specific workflows
- Acknowledges tool diversity rather than prescriptive uniformity

**Instructor role:**
- Provide awareness of options
- Don't provide formal instruction
- Support students who choose to use them ("I can't teach you Notion, but I can help troubleshoot how it fits workflow logs")

---

## Recording Privacy

### Legal and Ethical Boundaries

**Legal:**
- FERPA protects student privacy (can't record classmates without permission)
- Copyright protects instructor's teaching materials
- Unauthorized distribution can violate university conduct code

**Ethical:**
- Students should feel safe sharing in-process thinking without fear of public exposure
- Recording chills open discussion (people self-censor when recorded)
- Some students have safety reasons for not wanting video/audio online (domestic violence survivors, undocumented students)

**Policy balances:**
- Permit audio recording for personal study (benefits note-taking, review)
- Prohibit distribution (protects privacy)
- Require permission for video (faces identifiable)

**DRS accommodations:**
- Official note-taking or recording arrangements protect all parties
- Professional note-taker or recorded lectures don't expose individual students

---

## Failure Planning

### Resilience and Grace

**Technology will fail:**
- Canvas outages happen (historically 1-2 per semester)
- Devices break, get stolen, run out of battery
- Internet connections drop
- Software has bugs

**Policy provides:**
- Backup plans for major outages (email alternative submission)
- Grace for genuine tech failures (extensions when documented)
- Preventive strategies (cloud save, work on campus)

**Why this matters:**
- Punishing students for platform failures outside their control is unjust
- Teaching resilience (backup plans, cloud save) more valuable than expecting perfection

**Research base:**
- Resilience engineering principles: Systems should degrade gracefully, not catastrophically
- Applied to pedagogy: Course should function even when technology fails

---

## Implementation Approach

### Realistic Scope

**Instructor can teach:**
- Basic setup and navigation (OneDrive, Zotero, Eli)
- Course-specific workflows (how to use Eli for peer review in THIS course)
- Integration between tools (export Zotero citations to Word)

**Instructor cannot teach:**
- Deep technical troubleshooting (server errors, account authentication issues)
- Advanced features students won't use
- Alternative tools students choose independently

**Why boundaries matter:**
- Instructor expertise is pedagogy, not IT
- Setting boundaries prevents burnout (can't be 24/7 support)
- Empowers students to seek appropriate help channels

---

## Known Tensions

### Potential Issues

**Issue**: Students distracted by laptops despite policy
**Response**: Individual conversation ("I noticed you were on Instagram during in-class writing—what's up?"). Not public shaming, but accountability. Offer analog alternative if digital distraction is barrier.

**Issue**: Student can't afford $35 tech costs
**Response**: Confidential conversation. Options: Instructor discretionary fund, financial aid emergency assistance, free Zotero (forgo storage upgrade), library checkout laptops.

**Issue**: Student prefers different tools (e.g., Mendeley instead of Zotero)
**Response**: For personal use, fine. For submitted work (portfolio bibliography), must use course-required tools for compatibility. Can maintain both systems if willing to do extra work.

**Issue**: Tech outage during deadline
**Response**: Document outage (screenshot), email instructor, deadline extended for all students if platform-wide issue.

## Evidence & Iteration

### Evidence to Collect

**Tech effectiveness:**
- [ ] Student survey: How difficult was tech learning curve? (scale 1-5)
- [ ] Tech support requests: What issues most common?
- [ ] Laptop distraction: How often addressed informally?

**Access equity:**
- [ ] How many students lacked personal laptops?
- [ ] How many used library checkout or lab computers?
- [ ] Did any students struggle with $35 cost?

**Tool usefulness:**
- [ ] Zotero adoption: Did students continue using after course?
- [ ] OneDrive collaboration: Did students find real-time co-authoring helpful?
- [ ] Index cards: Analog vs. digital preference?

### Revision Notes

**Based on piloting, consider adjusting:**
- **Tool selection**: If Eli proves buggy, consider alternatives (Peergrade, Kritik)
- **Tech instruction timing**: If students struggle in Week 1, spread orientation across Weeks 1-2
- **Cost**: If $35 is barrier for many, seek departmental funding for Eli codes
- **Laptop policy**: If distraction widespread, experiment with laptop-free focused writing blocks (first 20 minutes of class)
