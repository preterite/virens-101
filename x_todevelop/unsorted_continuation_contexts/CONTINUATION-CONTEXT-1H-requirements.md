## IMMEDIATE NEXT TASK

### Reflection Component: Two-Pass Approach

**Component**: k_reflection/

**Decision**: Split into two passes for better review and quality control

#### PASS 1: Major Reflection Prompts (Priority)
**Scope**: 2 paired notes (4 files)

**Deliverables**:
1. **portfolio-cover-letter-prompt-course-v101.md** + reasons pair
   - THE major reflective assignment
   - 1500-2000 word student deliverable
   - Demonstrates all 7 outcomes with evidence
   - Worth significant portion of final portfolio
   - Requires extensive scaffolding

2. **mid-semester-reflection-checkpoint-course-v101.md** + reasons pair
   - Week 8-9 metacognitive pause
   - Prepares for conference week
   - Evidence-based corpus review
   - Formative feedback opportunity

**Why these first**: Portfolio cover letter is the capstone reflective piece; mid-semester checkpoint scaffolds toward it. These are the high-stakes, high-impact prompts that need the most attention.

#### PASS 2: Supporting Reflection Materials (After Review)
**Scope**: 2 paired notes (4 files)

**Deliverables**:
1. **evidence-based-reflection-guide-course-v101.md** + reasons pair
   - NOT an assignment, a resource/guide
   - Models and examples of evidence-based reflection
   - Shows difference between impressionistic vs. evidence-grounded claims
   - Referenced by both major prompts

2. **movement-transition-reflections-course-v101.md** + reasons pair
   - Brief formative check-ins at Movement boundaries (M1→M2, M2→M3, M3→M4, M4→Final)
   - 150-200 words each
   - Pattern recognition practice
   - Low-stakes metacognition

**Why these second**: Supporting materials that enhance the major prompts. Can be refined based on feedback from Pass 1.

## PROMPT READY FOR PASS 1 (k_reflection)

### Batch 1I: Reflection Documentation Pass 1

**Use this prompt structure**:

```
Please consult the Project Files obsidian-sorting-decisions-summary.md, 
engl101-course-design-synthesis.md, vault-conventions.md, and 
CONTINUATION-CONTEXT-1H-requirements.md for guidance on creating 
reflection prompt documents using the attached templates.

CONTENT SOURCES FOR THIS BATCH:
- Project File: outcomes1-content-v101.md (Outcome 7: Process Documentation 
  & Metacognition is central)
- Project File: 07_pedagogical_innovations.md (process documentation philosophy)
- Project File: 04b_operationalized_principles.md (reflection principles)

COMPLETED WORK TO REFERENCE:
- outcomes1-content-v101.md (ALL 7 outcomes - portfolio letter demonstrates all)
- grading-assessment-content-v101.md (portfolio worth 50%, includes cover letter)
- development-log-entries-course-v101.md (dev logs as evidence)
- weekly-accumulation-check-in-course-v101.md (ongoing reflection practice)
- All fragment assignments (what students reflect ON)
- time-commitment-labor-course-v101.md (labor made visible through reflection)

INTEGRATION NOTES:
- Portfolio cover letter is THE summative reflective piece for entire semester
- Mid-semester reflection connects to Week 9 conference week (already scheduled)
- Both prompts emphasize evidence-based reflection (cite process documentation)
- No impressionistic "I learned a lot" summaries - demand specificity
- Cover letter will be referenced in portfolio assembly instructions (future batch)
- Mid-semester feeds into second-half adjustments and conference discussions

CROSS-REFERENCING CONVENTIONS:
- Link heavily to: [[outcome-process-documentation]] (Outcome 7 primary)
- Portfolio letter links to ALL 7 outcomes: [[outcome-composing-processes]], 
  [[outcome-critical-thinking]], [[outcome-rhetorical-awareness]], 
  [[outcome-constraint-literacy]], [[outcome-textual-accumulation]], 
  [[outcome-workflow-technologies]], [[outcome-process-documentation]]
- Link to vocabulary: [[vocab-dev-log]], [[vocab-spec-document]], 
  [[vocab-system-map]], [[vocab-corpus]], [[vocab-fragment]]
- Link to assignments: [[development-log-entries-course-v101]], 
  [[weekly-accumulation-check-in-course-v101]]
- Use definition transclusions: ![[_def-dev-log-frequency]], 
  ![[_def-portfolio-weight]], ![[_def-fragment-target-total]]

SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS FOR REFLECTION PASS 1:

**1. Portfolio Cover Letter Prompt (THE BIG ONE):**
- Context: 
  - Why reflective cover letter matters (transfer, metacognition, outcome demonstration)
  - This is where semester's accumulated labor becomes visible and analyzable
  - Portfolio readers (instructor, future self, transfer institutions) use this to understand growth
  
- Task: 
  - "Write 1500-2000 word reflective letter demonstrating all 7 course outcomes 
    with specific evidence from your process documentation and corpus"
  - Must be clear, detailed, actionable one-sentence task statement
  
- Standards (link to ALL 7 outcomes):
  1. [[outcome-composing-processes]] - show process development through corpus evidence
  2. [[outcome-critical-thinking]] - demonstrate difficulty-as-diagnostic with examples
  3. [[outcome-rhetorical-awareness]] - cite specific rhetorical choices in polished work
  4. [[outcome-constraint-literacy]] - reference constraint sequencing experiences
  5. [[outcome-textual-accumulation]] - point to corpus growth and value accumulation
  6. [[outcome-workflow-technologies]] - describe workflow evolution with evidence
  7. [[outcome-process-documentation]] - use dev logs, spec docs, system maps as evidence
  
- Guidance (extensive, detailed):
  - What counts as evidence: dev log entries, fragment corpus statistics, spec documents, 
    system maps, peer review exchanges, revision histories
  - How to cite process documentation: "In my Week 3 dev log, I wrote..." or 
    "My system map from Week 7 shows..."
  - Organization options: by outcome (recommended), by movement, chronologically
  - Required elements: specific examples for each outcome, growth narrative, 
    challenges overcome
  - Common pitfalls: vague claims ("I improved my writing"), no evidence, 
    impressionistic language, summarizing rather than demonstrating
  - Time management: Start Week 13, draft by Week 14, revise during Week 15
  - Length guidance: ~200-250 words per outcome + introduction + conclusion
  - Model structure provided or referenced

**2. Mid-Semester Reflection Checkpoint:**
- Context:
  - Metacognitive pause at midpoint (end of M2, entering M3)
  - Prepares for Week 9 conferences with instructor
  - Assess first half to plan second half
  - Identify patterns before they become habits
  
- Task:
  - "Review your corpus (fragments, dev logs, accumulation check-ins) and identify 
    3 patterns of growth and 2 areas needing development. Write 500-750 words with 
    specific evidence."
  
- Standards:
  - [[outcome-process-documentation#Workflow logs and evidence-based reflection]]
  - [[outcome-composing-processes#Identify patterns and growth]]
  - [[outcome-textual-accumulation#Corpus awareness]]
  
- Guidance:
  - Use corpus statistics: How many fragments? What categories/themes emerging?
  - Review dev logs: What challenges repeated? What strategies worked?
  - Check accumulation check-ins: What patterns do you notice over 8 weeks?
  - Be specific: "Weeks 3-5 I produced 4-5 fragments/week, Weeks 6-8 dropped to 2-3"
  - Identify WHY: "Drop coincided with midterms in other classes"
  - Plan adjustments: "Second half: protect Sunday mornings for fragment writing"
  - Prepare for conference: Bring this reflection to discuss with instructor
  - Due: Week 8 or early Week 9 (before conference)

SYNC GROUPS TO INCLUDE:
- assessment-weights (reflection tied to portfolio worth 50%)
- fragment-model (students reflect on corpus accumulation)
- dev-log-specs (dev logs are primary evidence source)
- movement-schedule (mid-semester aligns with M2→M3 transition)

SCHOLARS TO CITE IN REASONS NOTES:
- Yancey (reflection and transfer, "Reflection in the Writing Classroom")
- Sommers/Saltz (longitudinal study, reflection's role in development)
- Beaufort (transfer research, domain awareness, mindful abstraction)
- Schön (reflection-in-action vs. reflection-on-action)
- Perkins/Salomon (high-road vs. low-road transfer, mindful abstraction)
- Anson (process documentation and metacognition)
- Nowacek (agents of integration, transfer)
- Wardle (threshold concepts and transfer)

CRITICAL PHILOSOPHICAL POINTS FOR REASONS NOTES:

**Portfolio Cover Letter Justification Should Address**:
- Why evidence-based vs. impressionistic reflection (transfer research)
- How reflection supports transfer (Perkins/Salomon's mindful abstraction)
- Portfolio cover letter as genre (Yancey's work on reflection)
- Relationship between process documentation and reflection (you need evidence to cite)
- Why all 7 outcomes (comprehensive demonstration, integration)
- Assessment approach (holistic, not checklist)
- How this differs from traditional portfolio cover letters
- Connection to labor-based grading (making labor visible)

**Mid-Semester Checkpoint Justification Should Address**:
- Why midpoint specifically (before habits calcify, time to adjust)
- Connection to conference week (formative intervention opportunity)
- Pattern recognition as metacognitive skill (Schön)
- Corpus awareness before synthesis phase (M3 requires managing accumulated material)
- Low-stakes practice for high-stakes portfolio letter (scaffolding)
- How this serves both instructor feedback and student self-awareness

QUALITY CRITERIA:
- Portfolio cover letter prompt is THE MOST DETAILED prompt in entire course
  - Students need extensive scaffolding for 1500-2000 word reflective piece
  - Must include models or detailed structural guidance
  - Every requirement must be crystal clear
  - Common pitfalls explicitly named and avoided
  
- Mid-semester checkpoint is briefer but still specific
  - Clear deliverable (500-750 words, 3 growth patterns, 2 development areas)
  - Concrete guidance on using process docs as evidence
  - Connects to conference week (students understand purpose)
  
- Both prompts emphasize SPECIFICITY over vagueness
  - "My Week 3 dev log shows..." not "I learned about writing"
  - "Fragment production increased from 3/week to 5/week" not "I wrote more"
  
- Reasons notes ground in transfer research
  - Why reflection matters for learning transfer
  - Evidence that reflection works (Yancey, Sommers/Saltz)
  - Connection to process documentation philosophy

SPECIAL NOTES:
- Portfolio cover letter will be referenced extensively in future batches
  - Portfolio assembly instructions will reference it
  - Final portfolio submission guidelines will reference it
  - This is a CORNERSTONE document for the course
  
- Mid-semester checkpoint timing is crucial
  - Must happen Week 8-9 (after M2, before M3)
  - Aligns with conference week (already in master schedule)
  - Gives students time to adjust second-half approach
  
- Pass 2 (evidence-based reflection guide, movement transitions) depends on Pass 1
  - Guide will reference these prompts as examples
  - Movement transitions scaffold toward mid-semester and portfolio letter
  - Review Pass 1 before generating Pass 2

Please generate all 4 files for Batch 1I (Reflection Pass 1), then present 
them for download.
```

## AFTER PASS 1 COMPLETION

### Next Steps

**Immediate**:
1. Review the 4 files from Pass 1 (portfolio letter prompt + mid-semester checkpoint)
2. Verify scaffolding is sufficient for portfolio cover letter
3. Check that mid-semester checkpoint aligns with conference week timing
4. Assess whether models/examples needed (might be separate files)

**Then Proceed to Pass 2**:
- Generate evidence-based reflection guide (references Pass 1 prompts)
- Generate movement transition reflections (scaffold toward Pass 1 checkpoints)
- Complete k_reflection component

**Or Pivot to Other Priorities**:
- Michael may want to tackle schedule/weekly plans next
- Or assignment prompts (f_assignments/ has fragments but not milestone assignments)
- Or reading guides (g_studentreadings/)

## KEY DESIGN DECISIONS FOR REFLECTION

### Philosophical Commitments

1. **Evidence-based reflection only**
   - No impressionistic "I learned a lot" summaries
   - Every claim must cite specific process documentation
   - Models mindful abstraction (Perkins/Salomon)

2. **Process documentation exists FOR reflection**
   - Dev logs, spec docs, system maps are evidence sources
   - Without documentation, reflection becomes generic
   - This is why we document process throughout semester

3. **Transfer is the goal**
   - Reflection serves transfer, not just grade justification
   - Portfolio cover letter helps students see patterns across contexts
   - Metacognition supports future writing situations

4. **Scaffolding throughout semester**
   - Weekly accumulation check-ins (ongoing practice)
   - Movement transitions (brief checkpoints)
   - Mid-semester reflection (formative)
   - Portfolio cover letter (summative)
   - Each builds toward next

### Assessment Integration

**Portfolio cover letter**:
- Part of final portfolio (worth 50% of course grade)
- Assessed holistically with polished pieces and corpus evidence
- Demonstrates outcome achievement
- NOT graded separately, integrated into portfolio evaluation

**Mid-semester checkpoint**:
- Formative feedback only
- Prepares for conferences
- NOT graded, completion credit only
- Supports second-half planning

**Movement transitions**:
- Brief, low-stakes
- Pattern recognition practice
- Completion credit only
