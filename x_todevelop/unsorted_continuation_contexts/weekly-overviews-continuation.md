## What's Next: Weekly Overviews (16 files)

### Structure per Weekly Note

**Context-Task-Standards-Guidance** (brief, standard voice):
- Context: What this week, how connects to last/next week, ongoing projects (3-4 sentences)
- Task: Big concept/practice this week (1 sentence)  
- Standards: Links to outcomes + deliverables with evaluation criteria (bullets)
- Guidance: Productive habits + links to past fragments for development (2-4 sentences)

**Synthesis Block** (4-6+ paragraphs, SPECIAL VOICE):
- **ONLY place in entire course using distinctive lecturing voice**
- See lessons-assignments-voice-guide-meta-v101.md for style
- First-person presence, register shifts, pop culture + theory, parentheticals, provisional conclusions
- Integrates b_overview/, c_rationale/, VIRENS concepts
- Connects to vivid/practical/pop-culture examples
- Functions as "lecture" prose
