## NEXT: Batch 1D (Tech Stack Documentation)

### Overview

Batch 1D will incorporate existing tech stack documentation created in prior conversations, reformatting with YAML frontmatter and creating paired justification notes where appropriate. These documents exist in project knowledge and need to be adapted to the dual-track structure.

### Target Files (7-8 files estimated)

**Existing tech docs to incorporate** (student-facing, need YAML frontmatter):
1. `tech-stack-path-a-course-v101.md` — Folder structure guide (adapted from `path-a-folder-structure.md`)
2. `eli-review-intro-course-v101.md` — Eli orientation (adapted from `eli-review-first-look.md`)
3. `index-cards-guide-course-v101.md` — Analog system guide (adapted from `index-cards-introduction.md`)
4. `integration-map-course-v101.md` — System connections (adapted from `integration-map.md`)

**Instructor-facing docs** (may not need justification pairs):
5. `instructor-setup-checklist-course-v101.md` — Pre-semester prep (adapted from `instructor-setup-checklist.md`)
6. `tech-stack-overview-course-v101.md` — Complete tech overview (adapted from `tech-stack-overview.md`)

**New justification note** (if needed):
7. `tech-stack-rationale-reasons-v101.md` — Pedagogical justification for Path A choices

**Optional** (if tokens allow):
8. `tech-wpr-integration-course-v101.md` — Tech instruction timing across semester (adapted from `tech-wpr-integration.md`)

## PEDAGOGICAL RATIONALE CONTENT (for justification note)

### Why Path A (Eli-Centered)?

**Decision factors** (from `tech-stack-overview.md` and conversations):
1. Eli Review is proven pedagogy with built-in training materials
2. Lower development burden on instructor
3. Clear separation of concerns (each tool does one thing well)
4. Adoptable by other instructors without heavy prep
5. Index cards provide tactile grounding that digital-only lacks
6. Total cost manageable ($30-35 vs. $100+ for alternatives)

### Theoretical Grounding

**Tool sequence pedagogy**:
- "Just-in-time" learning (tools when needed, not before)
- Familiarize before stakes (Eli intro Week 2, graded cycle Week 5)
- Touch reminders reinforce, don't introduce
- Scale determines timing (digital transfer Week 8 when corpus hits ~25 fragments)

**Key scholarly connections**:
- Selber's [[@selber2004multi]] "Multiliteracies" framework (functional, critical, rhetorical technology use)
- Situated learning theory (tools-in-context, not abstract training)
- Cognitive load theory (introduce one tool at a time, allow mastery before adding)

**Systems thinking principles**:
- Graceful degradation (if one tool fails, others still work)
- Multiple discovery paths (search by filename, browse by folder, filter by tag)
- Manual trigger points (students decide when to transfer, develop, submit)

## FILE STRUCTURE DECISIONS

### Component Assignment

| File | Component | Rationale |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| Folder structure guide | `b_overview` | Student-facing, foundational |
| Eli intro | `b_overview` | Student-facing, procedural |
| Index cards guide | `b_overview` | Student-facing, procedural |
| Integration map | `b_overview` | Both audiences, shows connections |
| Instructor checklist | `y_meta` | Instructor-only, setup |
| Tech stack overview | `y_meta` | Instructor-only, comprehensive |
| Tech-WPR integration | `y_meta` | Instructor-only, timing |
| Tech rationale | `c_rationale` | Justification for Path A choices |

### Pairing Decisions

**Paired with justification**:
- Integration map (substantial pedagogical reasoning)
- Possibly: Eli intro (why this platform vs. alternatives)

**Standalone** (no justification pair needed):
- Folder structure (procedural, not theoretical)
- Index cards (procedural, not theoretical)
- Instructor checklist (administrative, not pedagogical)
- Tech stack overview (already contains some rationale)

## QUALITY CHECKPOINTS FOR BATCH 1D

For each tech stack file:
1. ✅ YAML frontmatter includes: created, type, course, component, track, identifier, status, tags
2. ✅ Paired notes cross-reference each other functionally
3. ✅ Student-facing language is clear, accessible, jargon-free
4. ✅ Instructor-facing notes include implementation guidance
5. ✅ Tool introduction timing aligns with W/P/R rhythm and Movements
6. ✅ Cost information is accurate and complete
7. ✅ Troubleshooting guidance included where relevant
8. ✅ Cross-references to Movement overviews where tools are introduced

---

## FILE NAMING PATTERNS

**Pattern for tech docs**:
- Course (student-facing): `[tool-name]-[function]-course-v101.md`
- Reasons (justification): `[topic]-reasons-v101.md`
- Meta (instructor): `[topic]-meta-v101.md`

**Examples**:
- `tech-stack-path-a-course-v101.md`
- `eli-review-intro-course-v101.md`
- `index-cards-guide-course-v101.md`
- `integration-map-course-v101.md`
- `tech-stack-rationale-reasons-v101.md`
- `instructor-setup-checklist-meta-v101.md`

---

## ADAPTATION NOTES

When incorporating existing documents:

1. **Add YAML frontmatter** following templates
2. **Update cross-references** to use Obsidian wikilink format `[[note-name]]`
3. **Add "Related Content" dataview** queries at bottom
4. **Add "Paired" sections** linking to justification notes where applicable
5. **Preserve existing content structure** but update for dual-track context
6. **Add "When This Gets Used"** sections connecting to Movement overviews
7. **Update dates** to 2026-01-21 (current creation date)

---

## INTEGRATION WITH MOVEMENT OVERVIEWS

Each tech doc should reference when/where tools are introduced:

| Tool | First Introduced | Movement |
|------|-----------------|----------|
| Index cards | Week 2 (T1) | M1 |
| OneDrive/Word | Week 2 (T1) | M1 |
| Eli Review | Week 2 (T2, familiarization) | M1 |
| Eli Review (graded) | Week 5 (first graded cycle) | M2 |
| Zotero | Week 5 (T3-T4, library session) | M2 |
| Digital transfer | Week 8 (T5, "What You're Automating") | M3 |
| Advanced tools (optional) | Week 13 (T6) | M4 |

Cross-references should point to appropriate Movement overview sections.

## TOKEN BUDGET ANALYSIS

**Current status**:
- Tokens used: ~138,400 of 190,000
- Tokens remaining: ~51,600
- Average tokens/file: ~2,000-2,500

**Batch 1D estimates**:
- 7-8 files planned
- Estimated tokens: 14,000-20,000 total
- **Verdict**: Should fit comfortably in one batch

**Contingency**: If files run larger than expected, can split into:
- **Batch 1D-Part 1**: Student-facing tech docs (4 files, ~10,000 tokens)
- **Batch 1D-Part 2**: Instructor docs + justification (3-4 files, ~8,000 tokens)

---

## SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

### Index Cards as Analog/Digital Bridge

Index cards are pedagogically central—they're the *tactile* entry point before digital systems. Files should emphasize:
- Cards aren't just "backup" for digital—they do different cognitive work
- Physical sorting enables thinking that digital filtering doesn't
- Cards → OneDrive transfer is deliberate choice, not upgrade
- Students can continue using cards throughout semester even after digital transfer

### Eli Review Platform Specificity

Eli Review is commercial platform ($20/student). Documentation should:
- Acknowledge cost and justify it (proven pedagogy, built-in training)
- Provide alternatives if institution doesn't adopt Eli
- Include Eli-specific features (helpfulness ratings, matching algorithm)
- Connect to composition pedagogy research on structured peer review

### Tool Sequence as Pedagogical Innovation

Tech instruction timing isn't arbitrary—it's constraint sequencing applied to tool learning. Justification note should connect:
- Tool introduction sequence to constraint sequencing principle
- "Familiarize before stakes" to scaffolding research
- "Tech follows content" to situated learning theory
- Scale-dependent tool introduction to threshold concept theory
