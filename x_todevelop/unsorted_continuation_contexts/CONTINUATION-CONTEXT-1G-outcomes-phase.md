## EXISTING OUTCOMES DOCUMENTATION

### Already Present in Project Files

The following outcomes-related documents **already exist** and should be **reviewed and consulted** before generating new content:

#### 1. Grading & Assessment Documentation
**Location**: Project files (uploaded)

**grading-assessment-content-v101.md**
- Student-facing grading policy content
- 50/50 split: Portfolio (50%) + Formative Assessment (50%)
- Breakdown of formative components
- Late work policies
- Academic integrity integration
- Status: ✓ Complete, ready for reference

**grading-assessment-reasons-v101.md**
- Pedagogical justification for grading approach
- Labor-based grading philosophy
- Forgiveness mechanisms rationale
- Equity considerations
- Theoretical grounding (Inoue [[@inoue2019labos]], Elbow, Sommers)
- Status: ✓ Complete, ready for reference

#### 2. Outcomes Alignment Matrix
**Location**: Project files (uploaded)

**outcomes-alignment-matrix-v101-revised.md**
- Maps course activities to learning outcomes
- Shows alignment with: WPA Outcomes, NCTE Framework, WSU UCORE, WSU Writing Program
- Demonstrates complete coverage of institutional requirements
- Indicates how course exceeds conventional expectations
- Status: ✓ Complete, ready for reference

#### 3. Existing Outcomes Content Document
**Location**: Project files (uploaded)

**outcomes1-content-v101.md**
- Student-facing learning outcomes document
- Course-level outcomes organized by category
- Clear, accessible language for students
- Status: ✓ Complete, **NEEDS PAIRED JUSTIFICATION**

**CRITICAL**: This document exists but lacks its paired justification file.

---

## IMMEDIATE NEXT TASK

### Generate: outcomes1-reasons-v101.md

**Purpose**: Create pedagogical justification document paired with existing outcomes1-content-v101.md

**Requirements**:
1. Follow established dual-track structure (content/justification pairs)
2. Review and reference existing outcomes1-content-v101.md from project files
3. Ground outcomes in composition scholarship and learning science
4. Explain pedagogical rationale for each outcome category
5. Connect to course innovations (accumulation, process documentation, constraint sequencing)
6. Reference outcomes-alignment-matrix-v101-revised.md to show institutional alignment
7. Cite relevant sources from core readings (Bartholomae, Salvatori [[@salvatori1996conve]], Sommers, Elbow, etc.)

**Structure** (anticipated):
- Design philosophy section
- Rationale for outcome categories
- Theoretical grounding for each outcome cluster
- Connection to course innovations
- Assessment approach for each outcome
- Known tensions and how addressed
- Evidence collection strategy
- Scholarly sources

**Dependencies**:
- MUST review outcomes1-content-v101.md (already exists in project files)
- SHOULD reference outcomes-alignment-matrix-v101-revised.md (shows institutional coverage)
- SHOULD reference grading-assessment-reasons-v101.md (assessment philosophy)
- MAY reference pedagogical foundation files (04a_theoretical_frameworks.md, 04b_operationalized_principles.md)

---

## WORKING APPROACH FOR OUTCOMES PHASE

### Review Before Generation

**Before writing outcomes1-reasons-v101.md, Claude should**:

1. **Use project_knowledge_search** to retrieve:
   - outcomes1-content-v101.md (the content document being justified)
   - outcomes-alignment-matrix-v101-revised.md (institutional alignment context)
   - grading-assessment-reasons-v101.md (related assessment philosophy)

2. **Review core pedagogical documents**:
   - 04a_theoretical_frameworks.md (theoretical grounding)
   - 04b_operationalized_principles.md (principles in practice)
   - 07_pedagogical_innovations.md (course-specific innovations)

3. **Identify outcome categories** from outcomes1-content-v101.md and prepare justification for each

4. **Connect to composition scholarship**: Outcomes should be grounded in established research (WPA Outcomes Statement, NCTE Framework, transfer research, etc.)

### Generation Strategy

**Single-pass generation recommended**:
- outcomes1-reasons-v101.md is substantial but manageable in one file
- Estimated length: 3000-4000 words (comparable to policy justifications)
- Follow established justification template from previous work

**Quality checks**:
- Each outcome category has theoretical justification
- Connections to course innovations explicit
- Assessment approach for outcomes explained
- Scholarly citations present and relevant
- Paired with correct content document
- YAML frontmatter complete and accurate

---

## ANTICIPATED SUBSEQUENT WORK

### After outcomes1-reasons-v101.md

**Next component likely to be**: Course schedule/sequence or assignment prompts

**Potential next batches**:
1. Weekly schedule documents (15 weeks × 2-3 files each = significant volume)
2. Assignment prompt documents (major assignments + fragments)
3. Activity/lesson plan documents (in-class activities, workshops)
4. Reading materials/guides (if creating supplemental docs)

**Note**: Michael should be consulted on priority after outcomes documentation complete. The course design has many remaining components, and the order matters for pedagogical coherence.

---

## KEY DESIGN PRINCIPLES TO MAINTAIN

### Throughout Remaining Development

**From established patterns in policies work**:

1. **Dual-track structure**: Every content document gets a justification document
2. **Theoretical grounding**: Every pedagogical choice cites scholarship
3. **Student-facing clarity**: Content documents accessible, action-oriented, supportive
4. **Scholarly rigor**: Justification documents evidence-based, citation-ready
5. **Cross-referencing**: Documents link to related components
6. **YAML completeness**: Frontmatter enables vault-wide organization
7. **Implementation notes**: Where relevant, include practical execution guidance

**Course-specific principles**:
- Constraint sequencing (when things arrive matters)
- Accumulation over episodes (corpus building)
- Process documentation valued
- Failure-as-diagnostic (difficulty is information)
- Writing-as-verb and writing-as-noun both honored

## NOTES FOR MICHAEL

### Before Next Session

**No action required** unless:
1. You want to revise any completed policy documents (all 18 in outputs directory)
2. You want to adjust direction (prioritize different component)
3. You've completed other documentation that should be integrated

**To proceed with outcomes work**:
- Simply indicate readiness to generate outcomes1-reasons-v101.md
- Claude will review existing outcomes1-content-v101.md and produce paired justification
- Expect one substantial file (~3000-4000 words)

**For batch work management**:
- Outcomes is relatively small component (just 1 pair needed)
- After outcomes, recommend planning next major component (schedule, assignments, or activities)
- Some components may require multiple passes due to length

---

## TECHNICAL NOTES

### File Organization

**Outputs directory** currently contains:
- 18 policy files (9 pairs from 3 passes)
- Ready for transfer to Scholar vault: `600_teaching/virens_101/`

**Suggested vault organization** (for when files transferred):
```
600_teaching/virens_101/
├── h_policies/
│   ├── ai-academic-integrity-course-v101.md
│   ├── ai-academic-integrity-reasons-v101.md
│   ├── [... all 18 policy files ...]
├── i_grading_assessment/
│   ├── grading-assessment-content-v101.md
│   ├── grading-assessment-reasons-v101.md
│   ├── outcomes-alignment-matrix-v101-revised.md
└── j_outcomes/
    ├── outcomes1-content-v101.md
    ├── outcomes1-reasons-v101.md (TO BE CREATED)
```

### Token Budget Management

- Current session: ~101,000 tokens remaining (adequate for outcomes1-reasons-v101.md)
- Single justification file: ~5,000-6,000 tokens (well within budget)
- If running low, can split into passes, but single-pass preferred for coherence
