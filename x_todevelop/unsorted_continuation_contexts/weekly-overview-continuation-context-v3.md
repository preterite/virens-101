# VIRENS 101 Weekly Index Generation: Continuation Context v3

**Created**: 2026-01-24
**Purpose**: Resume weekly index note generation in new chat
**Status**: 7 of 15 weeks complete

---

## Project Overview

Generating weekly index notes for VIRENS 101 composition course. Each week requires:
- Synthesis prose (~600-900 words) integrating reading, concepts, course arc
- Full template following `weekly-index-template.md` structure
- YAML frontmatter with proper metadata
- Block-by-block schedule with detailed activity descriptions

## Key Decisions Archive

### Structural Decisions
- **Synthesis length**: ~600-900 words, 7-10 paragraphs
- **Quotation handling**: 2-3 key quotes per week, integrated with interpretation
- **Historical contextualization**: Brief bios for unfamiliar figures (first appearance)
- **Concept introduction**: Name explicitly when introduced; vary language when deepening
- **Thematic threading**: Difficulty/visibility arc, intervention/fit arc, transformation arc

### Content Decisions
- **Envelope exercise**: W1, returns W15 only
- **SEAR**: Introduced W4 (mnemonic), deepened W6 (expanded)
- **BEAM**: Introduced W6 (conceptually), categorized W7, portfolio W8-11
- **Dev log**: Started W3, continues through semester
- **Mill/store (Babbage)**: Introduced W8, anticipated in W5 synthesis
- **Permission flags**: Light touch W7 (visible/invisible, modifiable/locked), **full treatment W13**
- **Spec Document**: Referenced VIRENS-Functional-Spec-v1_0.md for concept; assignment file exists

### Process Decisions
- **Quotation protocol**: Claude proposes 4 candidates, user selects 2-3
- **Clarifying questions**: Asked before synthesis drafting
- **One week at a time**: Synthesis approval before full template generation
- **Constraint Audit assignment**: Existing file at `f_assignments/spec-document-constraint-audit-assignment-reasons-v101.md`

## Week 10 Preparation

### Schedule (from consolidated)

| Block | Type | Activity |
|-------|------|----------|
| 1 | W | BEAM Portfolio entry drafting |
| 2 | R (touch) | Revision + (folder organization check: 5 min) |
| 3 | P | **Eli Review Cycle 5: BEAM Portfolio Framing** |
| 4 | R | Revision based on feedback |
| 5 | W | Continue BEAM Portfolio |
| 6 | W | Content mapping exercise |

**Reading**: Star [[@star1999ethnp]] + Bush [[@bush1945thinl]] (~30-40 pages) — **Difficulty Pair A completes**
**Tech**: Folder check touch
**Peer Review**: Cycle 5 (Generous/SPQ—returns to generous after evaluative)
**Reflective One-Pager**: Due after Cycle 5
**Due**: BEAM Portfolio Framing (mid-week)

### Concepts to Introduce
- Infrastructure invisibility (ONESIE) — Star
- Boundary objects (ONESIE) — Star
- Memex vision (ONESIE) — Bush

### Concepts to Deepen
- Difficulty-as-diagnostic (Pair A completion—Salvatori [[@salvatori1996conve]] W3 returns)
- Graph thinking (Ong [[@ong2012writi]] W2 → Bush W10)
- Six-move framework (connect emphasis)
- Process visibility (Star's infrastructure work connects to Salvatori's process visibility)

### Thematic Connections
- Salvatori (W3): making invisible *processes* visible
- Star (W10): making invisible *infrastructure* visible
- Bush: anticipatory vision of connected knowledge systems
- Pair A theme: visibility/surfacing

### Quotation Protocol
- Search project knowledge for Star and Bush material
- Propose 4 candidates for user selection
- Likely 2-3 quotations given complexity (3 ONESIES)

## Workflow for Each Week

1. **Gather context**: Schedule + concept inventory for target week
2. **Identify requirements**: ONESIES, concepts to introduce/deepen, difficulty pair status
3. **Search for quotations**: Project knowledge search for reading material
4. **Propose quotation candidates**: 4 candidates for user selection
5. **Ask clarifying questions**: As needed for thematic connections, emphasis
6. **Draft synthesis**: ~600-900 words after user answers
7. **Get synthesis approval**: User confirms before full template
8. **Generate full template**: All sections per weekly-index-template.md
9. **Present file**: User downloads for vault placement

---

## Inventory Updates Needed

Update `synthesis-concept-inventory-meta-v101.md`:
- SEAR procedure: "Week 4 (introduced), Week 6 (deepened)" — already noted
- Permission flags: "Week 7 (previewed), Week 13 (full treatment)"
- Mill/store: "Week 5 (anticipated), Week 8 (introduced)"

---

## Documents Flagged for Development

These were noted during generation but don't exist yet:

- SEAR Handout (student reference after W4 introduction)
- Spec Document template (simplified for student use)
- Zotero setup guide
- Source genealogy template
- BEAM framework handout
- Difficulty Pair overview notes (A and B)

---

## Next Session Instructions

1. Load this document as continuation context
2. Begin Week 10 preparation:
   - Search project knowledge for Star and Bush quotations
   - Propose 4 candidates
   - Ask clarifying questions about Pair A completion emphasis
3. Draft Week 10 synthesis after user selections
4. Generate full Week 10 template after synthesis approval
5. Continue with Week 12 (Norman [[@norman2013desig]], M3→M4 transition)

## Session Notes

**This session completed**:
- Week 4 (SEAR, rhetoric)
- Week 5 (Meadows, leverage points, stocks/flows, Pair B begins)
- Week 7 (Alexander [[@alexander1964notet]], goodness of fit, misfits, Pair B completes, DES protocol)
- Concept coverage matrix
- Permission flags decision: light touch W7, full treatment W13

**Key quotation selections**:
- Week 5 (Meadows): B (counterintuitive warning) + C (stocks/flows bathtub)
- Week 7 (Alexander): A (form/context definition) + C (misfits as what demands attention) + D (negative process, with process caveat)

**Process refinements**:
- Mill/store anticipatory link added to W5 synthesis
- Permission flags preview integrated into W7 with explicit deferral to W13
- DES protocol shift explicitly framed as Alexander-connected
- Process caveat on Alexander's "negative process": don't hunt errors before checking structural fit
