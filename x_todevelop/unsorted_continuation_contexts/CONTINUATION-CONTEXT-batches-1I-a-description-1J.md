## COMPLETED WORK SUMMARY

### Batch 1I: Reflection Pass 1 (k_reflection/)
**Deliverables**: 4 files (2 pairs)
**Completion Status**: ✅ Complete

#### 1. Portfolio Cover Letter Prompt
- **Files**: `portfolio-cover-letter-prompt-course-v101.md` + `reasons-v101.md`
- **Scope**: THE MOST DETAILED prompt in entire course (1500-2000 words)
- **Content**:
  - Context: Why reflective cover letter matters (transfer, metacognition, outcome demonstration)
  - Task: One clear sentence - demonstrate all 7 outcomes with specific evidence
  - Standards: Linked to ALL 7 outcomes with demonstration requirements
  - Guidance: Extensive (what counts as evidence, how to cite, organizational options, required elements, length guidance, common pitfalls, time management)
  - Evidence types: Dev logs, corpus stats, spec docs, system maps, peer review, revision histories
  - Citation methods: Direct quotation, paraphrase with reference, summary with specifics
  - Organization options: By outcome, by movement, chronologically (no "recommended")
  - Common pitfalls: Vague vs. specific contrasts throughout
- **Reasons**: Grounded in Yancey [[@yancey1998refle]], Sommers/Saltz [[@sommers2004novid]], Beaufort [[@beaufort2007colle]], Perkins/Salomon transfer research; evidence-based vs. impressionistic rationale; comprehensive integration philosophy

#### 2. Mid-Semester Reflection Checkpoint
- **Files**: `mid-semester-reflection-checkpoint-course-v101.md` + `reasons-v101.md`
- **Scope**: Week 8-9 formative checkpoint (500-750 words)
- **Content**:
  - Context: Metacognitive pause at midpoint (M2→M3), prepares for Week 9 conferences
  - Task: 3 growth patterns + 2 development areas with specific evidence
  - Detailed calculation instructions: Fragment production by time period, revision percentages, dev log consistency, specific formulas provided
  - Step-by-step guidance: Gather stats → review dev logs → review check-ins → identify patterns → write
  - Vague vs. specific examples for both growth and development areas
  - Connection to portfolio letter as practice
- **Reasons**: Schön (reflection-in-action vs. reflection-on-action), timing theory (intervention before calcification), pattern recognition as metacognitive skill, low-stakes practice for high-stakes portfolio letter

### Batch a_description (a_description/)
**Deliverables**: 4 files (2 pairs)
**Completion Status**: ✅ Complete

#### 1. Catalog Description
- **Files**: `catalog-description-course-v101.md` + `reasons-v101.md`
- **Scope**: One-sentence WSU catalog description
- **Content**: "Designed to develop students' academic writing **processes**, critical thinking, rhetorical **awareness**, and research **practices** through sustained textual accumulation and constraint-based writing."
- **Key Shifts**:
  - "academic writing" → "academic writing **processes**" (signals process orientation)
  - "rhetorical strategies" → "rhetorical **awareness**" (emphasizes metacognition)
  - "reading and library skills" → "research **practices**" (modernizes, emphasizes workflow)
  - Added: "through sustained textual accumulation and constraint-based writing"
- **Reasons**: Explains each shift with composition research (Sommers, Elbow); maintains institutional legibility while signaling innovation; connects to Meadows [[@meadows2008lever]]' stocks/flows

#### 2. Course Overview
- **Files**: `course-overview-course-v101.md` + `reasons-v101.md`
- **Scope**: One paragraph (275 words) for syllabus
- **Content**: Synthesizes Edwards's traditional language with VIRENS philosophy
  - Maintains "two areas of expertise" structure
  - Integrates corpus/fragments (![[_def-fragment-target-total]])
  - Introduces constraint sequencing, difficulty-as-diagnostic
  - Emphasizes making intellectual labor visible
  - Natural flow - innovations embedded in accessible explanations
  - Research-grounded without requiring citations
  - Final sentence reframes "real work of writing" as process
- **Reasons**: Comprehensive synthesis of composition pedagogy (Sommers, Elbow, Flower [[@flower1981cogni]]/Hayes, Yancey) and systems thinking (Meadows, Alexander [[@alexander1964notet]], Schön); accessibility vs. precision balance; aspirational vs. descriptive framing

### Batch 1J: Reflection Pass 2 (k_reflection/)
**Deliverables**: 8 files (4 pairs)
**Completion Status**: ✅ Complete

#### 1. Evidence-Based Reflection Guide
- **Files**: `evidence-based-reflection-guide-course-v101.md` + `reasons-v101.md`
- **Scope**: Reference guide for repeated consultation throughout semester
- **Content**: Three core skills with detailed how-to
  1. **Mining dev logs**: How to reread, what to flag (breakthroughs, struggles, strategies), quote vs. paraphrase, examples
  2. **Calculating statistics**: Fragment production rates, revision percentages, category distributions, dev log consistency - with worked calculations
  3. **Identifying patterns**: Testing criteria (3+ examples, spans weeks, measurable), distinguishing patterns from isolated incidents
  - "How to Use This Guide" section explicitly maps skills to assignments
  - Vague vs. specific contrasts throughout
- **Reasons**: Yancey's systematic inquiry principle; Sommers/Saltz analytical vs. descriptive reflection; progressive skill building; quantitative literacy in humanities context

#### 2. M1→M2 Transition Reflection
- **Files**: `M1-to-M2-transition-reflection-course-v101.md` + `reasons-v101.md`
- **Scope**: Week 3 checkpoint after Surfacing, before Naming
- **Content**: Four structured prompts adapted from Yancey
  1. Surprises and discoveries (expectation vs. reality)
  2. Pattern recognition (first 8-12 fragments)
  3. Repeated challenges (difficulty as diagnostic)
  4. Forward-looking intentions (M1→M2 connection)
  - Each prompt with detailed guidance and example response
  - Synthesis paragraph requirement (150-250 words, first person)
- **Reasons**: Early pattern recognition before habits calcify; Salvatori's [[@salvatori1996conve]] difficulty-as-diagnostic; Beaufort's forward-looking transfer preparation; two-layer scaffolding with evidence guide

#### 3. M2→M3 Transition Reflection
- **Files**: `M2-to-M3-transition-reflection-course-v101.md` + `reasons-v101.md`
- **Scope**: Week 8 checkpoint, complements mid-semester reflection
- **Content**: Four movement-specific prompts
  1. Constraint impact (M2's distinctive work)
  2. Naming insights (what categorization revealed)
  3. Process evolution (M1 vs. M2 comparison)
  4. Anticipating scale (preparing for M3)
  - Explicitly differentiated from mid-semester checkpoint (lighter, movement-focused)
  - Same synthesis paragraph structure
- **Reasons**: Constraint literacy (Alexander - constraints as generative); naming as epistemology (Meadows); dual reflections serve complementary purposes; movement-specific without redundancy

#### 4. M3→M4 Transition Reflection
- **Files**: `M3-to-M4-transition-reflection-course-v101.md` + `reasons-v101.md`
- **Scope**: Week 11-12 bridge to synthesis and portfolio
- **Content**: Four prompts (concrete→abstract→evaluative→projective)
  1. Scale impact (35-40 fragments changed practice how?)
  2. Connection discoveries (surprising patterns across corpus)
  3. Growth assessment (M1 vs. M3 with evidence)
  4. Synthesis anticipation (M4/portfolio preparation)
  - Explicitly positioned as "final transition before portfolio cover letter"
  - Bridge function: M3 closure + M4 preparation
- **Reasons**: Emergent properties at scale (Meadows); connection-finding as epistemological discovery (Yancey constructive reflection); comprehensive growth assessment for transfer; anticipatory preparation for synthesis

## KEY DESIGN PATTERNS ESTABLISHED

### Reflection Architecture
1. **Complete scaffolding sequence**: Weekly check-ins → M1→M2 → M2→M3 (+ mid-semester) → M3→M4 → portfolio letter
2. **Evidence guide as foundation**: All transitions reference it for methodology
3. **Progressive complexity**: Discovery/patterns → constraints/evolution → comprehensive assessment/synthesis prep
4. **Synthesis paragraphs**: Every transition requires first-person integration, not just prompt responses
5. **Yancey framework throughout**: Structured prompts based on expectation vs. reality, pattern recognition, self-assessment, forward planning

### Description Philosophy
1. **Catalog conservative, overview innovative**: Audience hierarchy maintained
2. **Continuity with existing Edwards language**: Phrases anchor students in familiar
3. **Innovations as refinements**: Not replacements but enhancements
4. **No jargon without explanation**: Functions described, not theories cited
5. **Research grounding without citations**: "Substantial empirical research" signals authority without overwhelming

### Quality Markers
- All 16 files include complete YAML frontmatter with sync-groups, dependencies, attention flags
- Heavy cross-referencing to outcomes, vocabulary, existing assignments
- Definition transclusions where appropriate (![[_def-X]])
- Scholarly citations formatted and complete in reasons notes
- Example responses model specificity in all reflection prompts
- Vague vs. specific contrasts teach by counter-example throughout

- Portfolio letter references ALL 7 outcomes: [[outcome-X]] links
- Mid-semester checkpoint references weekly check-ins, dev logs
- Evidence guide referenced by ALL reflection assignments
- Movement transitions reference their M-overview notes
- Course overview references outcomes1-content-v101
- All notes reference vocab definitions appropriately

### Sync Groups Established
- **reflection-scaffolding**: All k_reflection files
- **course-identity**: a_description files
- **assessment-weights**: Portfolio letter, mid-semester checkpoint
- **movement-schedule**: All transition reflections
- **conference-week**: Mid-semester checkpoint, M2→M3 transition

## NEXT PRIORITIES

### Immediate: Complete g_studentreadings/
**Status**: Partially complete (some readings described in project knowledge)
**Remaining Work**: Document all assigned readings with paired notes

**What exists**:
- Project files show reading theory (12_reading_theory_and_practice.md)
- Reading list (15_other_side_reading_list.md)
- Core texts available: Ong [[@ong2012writi]], Salvatori, Bartholomae, Kirschenbaum, etc.

**What's needed**: Paired notes for each assigned reading
- Course notes: Reading description, context, guiding questions, connection to outcomes
- Reasons notes: Why this reading, theoretical grounding, pedagogical approach, reading-as-writing practice

**Likely structure**:
```
g_studentreadings/
├── ong-orality-literacy-course-v101.md + reasons
├── salvatori-conversations-texts-course-v101.md + reasons
├── bartholomae-inventing-university-course-v101.md + reasons
├── kirschenbaum-textpocalypse-course-v101.md + reasons
├── bush-as-we-may-think-course-v101.md + reasons
└── [others as identified]
```

**Approach**:
1. Inventory all readings referenced in course materials
2. Prioritize core readings (Ong, Salvatori, Bartholomae as foundations)
3. Create paired notes following template structure
4. Ground in reading-as-writing pedagogy (Salvatori's "difficulty papers")
5. Connect each reading to specific course outcomes and movements

### After g_studentreadings: Remaining Batches
Based on comprehensive project scope, likely remaining:
- **b_syllabus**: Syllabus assembly and master schedule
- **c_rationale**: Theoretical/pedagogical overviews (may already be covered in project files)
- **e_activities**: In-class activities and workshop descriptions
- **f_assignments**: Major assignment prompts (fragment assignments, etc.)
- **i_tools**: Tech stack documentation and tool instructions
- **j_vocabulary**: Definitions and concept explanations (may be partially complete)
- **l_portfolio**: Portfolio assembly and submission instructions
- **m_workscited**: Master bibliography and citation management

### Questions for Next Session
1. How many readings should g_studentreadings cover? (Core required texts only, or all potential readings?)
2. Should reading notes include discussion prompts or focus on context/rationale?
3. Any readings that need to be created/written (not just assigned from existing sources)?
4. Priority order for remaining batches after g_studentreadings?

## NOTES FOR CONTINUATION

### What Worked Well
- Breaking reflection work into two passes (Pass 1: major checkpoints, Pass 2: supporting materials) created logical grouping
- Evidence guide as reference document provides consistent methodology for all reflections
- Example responses in every prompt successfully model desired specificity
- Synthesis paragraph requirement pushes beyond prompt compliance to integrated understanding
- Movement-specific focus prevents redundancy while maintaining systematic coverage

### Adjustments Made During Session
- M2→M3 transition explicitly differentiated from mid-semester checkpoint to prevent confusion
- Portfolio cover letter guidance extensively detailed (most detailed prompt in course) per instructions
- Mid-semester checkpoint includes concrete calculation instructions per clarifications
- Movement transitions follow Yancey-inspired prompt structure but adapted to first-year context
- Catalog description kept conservative while course overview went innovative per audience hierarchy guidance

### Patterns to Maintain
- Vague vs. specific contrasts throughout prompts (teach by counter-example)
- Complete YAML frontmatter with sync-groups and dependencies
- Heavy scholarly grounding in reasons notes
- Student-facing language in course notes (second person, accessible)
- Definition transclusions where appropriate
- Example responses showing evidence use

### Remember for Next Batches
- Always consult project files before generating
- Ask clarifying questions about scope and structure
- Generate all files before presenting (don't show work-in-progress)
- Maintain template adherence while adapting to content needs
- Cross-reference extensively within and across batches
- Ground in both composition pedagogy AND systems/design thinking
