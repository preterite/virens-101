## Finalized Reading Schedule by Block

### Core Principle: No Reading Due on P or R Blocks

Readings are assigned only to W (Writing) blocks. This implements "YOLO up, constrain down"—students encounter generative provocation before evaluative/revision work.

### Week 1 Special Case

**Sequence**: Kirschenbaum (blocks 3-4) → Syllabus (blocks 5-6)

Rationale: Get students writing into the work of the course first; administrative concerns later. This helps add-drop students acclimate faster and models the "generate first, worry later" philosophy.

### Complete Reading Table

| Week | Block 1 | Block 2 | Block 3 | Block 4 | Block 5 | Block 6 | Total Pages |
|------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|-------------|
| W1 | — | W | Kirschenbaum (10) | Kirschenbaum | Syllabus | Syllabus | **10** |
| W2 | Ong (25-30) | T1 | T2 | READMEs (5-10) | W | W | **30-40** |
| W3 | Salvatori (15) | R | W | P | Bunn (12) | W | **27** |
| W4 | Downs (20-25) | Downs | P | R | W | I | **20-25** |
| W5 | T3 | T4 | Meadows (20) | W | P | R | **20** |
| W6 | Borges cluster (11) | W | P | R | Jackson (15-20) | I | **26-31** |
| W7 | Alexander (20-25) | R | P | R | W | W | **20-25** |
| W8 | T5 | Brooks (15-20) | W | P | R | R | **15-20** |
| W9 | — | — | — | — | — | — | **0** |
| W10 | Star (15) | R | P | R | Bush (12) | W | **27** |
| W11 | Ribes & Jackson (20) | R | R | I | W | R | **20** |
| W12 | Norman (35) | Norman | P | R | R | R | **35** |
| W13 | R | R | Bernstein (8) | **W** | I | Bishop (10) + R | **18** |
| W14 | — | — | — | — | — | — | **0** |
| W15 | Lamott (4-5) | R | W | — | — | — | **4-5** |

**Semester Total**: ~247-285 pages (within 250-300 target range)

### Week 13 Structural Fix

**Problem identified**: Original schedule had zero W blocks in Week 13.

**Solution**: 
- Block 4 changed from R → W
- Block 6 consolidates portfolio assembly (was split blocks 4 + 6)
- Bernstein assigned block 3; Bishop assigned blocks 5-6

### Reading Rhythm Patterns

| Pattern | Weeks | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|
| Heavy (30+ pp) | W2, W12 | Balanced by tech instruction (W2) or revision focus (W12) |
| Medium-Heavy (25-30 pp) | W3, W6, W10 | Difficulty pairs or split readings |
| Medium (15-25 pp) | W4, W5, W7, W8, W11, W13 | Sustainable baseline |
| Light (0-15 pp) | W1, W9, W14, W15 | Conference, presentations, portfolio weeks |

### Documented Inquiry Research Page Budget

**Key insight**: Weeks 10-13 have both assigned readings AND student research reading for BEAM Portfolio and Documented Inquiry.

| Week | Assigned Reading | Student Research Load |
|------|-----------------|----------------------|
| W10 | 27 pp | Beginning BEAM source accumulation |
| W11 | 20 pp | Active BEAM completion |
| W12 | 35 pp (heaviest) | Documented Inquiry drafting |
| W13 | 18 pp | Revision; research reading decreasing |

**Mitigation**: W11 and W13 kept lighter on assigned reading. W12's Norman reading is dense but practical—directly supports Process Archaeology work happening same week.

## "YOLO Up, Constrain Down" — Rationale Page Content

### Why This Deserves Its Own Page

This phrase captures a **recurring structural principle** at multiple scales:

| Scale | Manifestation |
|-------|---------------|
| Semester | M1 expansion → M2-M4 increasing constraint |
| Weekly | W blocks precede R blocks |
| W1 | Kirschenbaum before syllabus |
| Assignments | Brainstorm → narrow; spec docs after exploratory drafting |
| Envelope exercise | Capture raw hopes first; analyze 15 weeks later |
| Permission flags | Full private write first; sharing/locking later |
| Reading rhythm | Provocations before how-to |
| Freewriting | Keep hand moving, judge later |

### Theoretical Grounding

| Tradition | Connection |
|-----------|------------|
| Elbow | Freewriting; generative writing without judgment |
| Design thinking | Divergent/convergent phases (IDEO, d.school) |
| Alexander | Identify misfits through exploration first |
| Constraint sequencing | *When* constraints arrive matters as much as *what* they are |
| Agile/iterative | Working prototype before specification |

### Key Principle

Generate first, worry later. Use natural rhythms to make "worrying" into identifying which already-existing restrictions eliminate options—not doing fresh mental work, but recognizing what's already constrained.

## Workflow for Next Session

### Option A: Complete Works Cited Phase

1. Verify publication details (Priority 1 list in sources-inventory-v101.md)
2. Generate formatted works cited (MLA) for student syllabus
3. Generate comprehensive bibliography for administrator package
4. Generate annotated reading list

### Option B: Generate Missing Vault Pages

1. Create yolo-up-constrain-down-reasons-v101.md
2. Create 5 g_studentreadings page pairs (Bunn, Borges, Jackson, Bishop, Lamott)
3. Update 6 weekly overviews with reading block assignments
4. Update schedule consolidated document

### Option C: Hybrid (Recommended)

**First**: Create yolo-up-constrain-down-reasons-v101.md (foundational; 1 file)
**Then**: Update weekly overviews (student-facing; 6 files)
**Then**: Generate g_studentreadings pages (5 pairs = 10 files)
**Finally**: Works cited and verification

### Estimated Scope

| Task | Files | Est. Words |
|------|-------|------------|
| YOLO rationale page | 1 | 1,500-2,000 |
| Weekly overview updates | 6 | 600-1,200 (edits) |
| g_studentreadings pages | 10 | 6,000-8,000 |
| Formatted works cited | 2-3 | 1,000-1,500 |
| **Total** | ~20 | ~10,000-12,000 |

---

## Key Numbers Summary

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Weekly overviews complete | 15/15 |
| Student-facing readings | 20 |
| Total pages assigned | ~247-285 |
| Weeks with reading | 12 (W1-W8, W10-W13, W15) |
| Weeks without reading | 3 (W9, W14, W15 presentations/portfolio) |
| Difficulty pairs | 2 |
| Dense/practical pairings | 3 (W3, W13, W15) |
| g_studentreadings pages needed | 10 (5 pairs) |
| Weekly overviews needing update | 6 |
| New c_rationale pages needed | 1 |

## Administrator Package Preview

For later session, materials for administrator review:

### Reading List Highlights

- **Balance**: Composition pedagogy (Salvatori, Downs, Bunn, Bishop, Lamott) + systems thinking (Meadows, Alexander, Brooks, Norman, Star) + experimental/literary (Borges, Jackson, Bernstein)
- **Page load**: ~250-285 pages total; realistic for FYC
- **Difficulty pairs**: Intentional challenging readings with supports
- **Practical complements**: Dense theory paired with accessible how-to (W3, W13)

### Distinctive Features to Highlight

1. **Reading rhythm mapped to block types** (no reading due on P/R blocks)
2. **"YOLO up, constrain down"** as articulated design philosophy
3. **Lamott at W15** (retrospective rather than introductory placement)
4. **Borges cluster** as classification provocation (unusual for FYC)
5. **Systems readings** integrated throughout (not segregated as "theory unit")
