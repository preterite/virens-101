## KEY DESIGN DECISIONS DOCUMENTED

### 1. Grade Structure (50/50 Split)

**Portfolio: 50%**
- Holistic assessment of seven course outcomes
- Includes polished pieces, process evidence, reflective cover letter
- Exempt from late penalties (end-of-semester submission)
- Allows students to showcase growth and curate best work

**Formative: 50%**
- Fragment Accumulation: 15% (12% completion + 3% quality baseline)
- Revision & Feedback: 20% (10% peer review + 10% reflective one-pagers)
- Process Documentation: 10% (dev logs + system maps)
- Attendance & Participation: 5% (daily quizzes, 10 lowest dropped)

**Rationale**: Values both process (verb) and product (noun); provides continuous feedback while maintaining high-stakes portfolio significance

### 2. Portfolio Components

**Required elements**:
1. **Polished pieces** (4-6 selected from 40-50 fragments)
2. **Process evidence** (drafts with tracked changes, peer feedback received)
3. **Reflective cover letter** (1,500-2,000 words, evidence-based grade argument)
4. **Curated presentation** (organized, professional, intentional selection)

**Selection strategy**: Choose pieces that best demonstrate achievement of seven outcomes, showing range and depth

### 3. Reflective Cover Letter Structure

**Seven components** (1,500-2,000 words total):
1. Introduction with grade claim (150-200 words)
2. Outcome-by-outcome analysis (900-1,200 words, ~130-170 per outcome)
3. Process evolution (300-400 words)
4. Revision documentation (200-300 words)
5. Challenges & failures (150-250 words)
6. Transfer potential (150-200 words)
7. Conclusion (100-150 words)

**Timeline**: Weeks 12-15, 11-15 hours total (distributed across 4 weeks)

**Assessment**: Argument quality (35%), Metacognitive depth (30%), Evidence integration (25%), Writing quality (10%)

### 4. Late Work Policy

**Graduated penalties**:
- 1-2 days late: -20%
- 3-7 days late: -30%
- 8+ days late: -50%

**Portfolio exception**: No late penalties (due end of semester)

**Rationale**: Balances peer review timing needs with student flexibility; partial credit better than zero for equity

### 5. Revision Credit (20% of Grade)

**Highest formative component** to signal course values:
- Eli Review participation: 10% (helpfulness ratings, cycle completion)
- Reflective one-pagers: 10% (four across semester, cite feedback + document revisions)

**Six Eli Review cycles**: Weeks 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 14 (aligned with Movement transitions)

**Four reflective one-pagers**: Weeks 6, 9, 12, 14 (after substantial revision work)

### 6. Formative Assessment Philosophy

**Completion-heavy approach**:
- Fragment accumulation: 80% completion (12%), 20% quality baseline (3%)
- Process documentation: 100% completion-based
- Quizzes: Completion-based with 10 lowest dropped

**Why**: Reduces daily grading burden, lowers anxiety, values labor while maintaining quality threshold

**Quality baseline prevents**: "Junk accumulation" where students hit word counts without genuine engagement

### 7. Portfolio Rubric Design

**Holistic assessment** across seven outcomes:
- Each outcome rated: Exceptional / Proficient / Developing / Beginning
- Achievement levels defined with evidence requirements
- Portfolio grade determined by overall pattern (not averaging)

**Avoids deficit framing**:
- "Developing" not "Needs Improvement"
- "Beginning" not "Unsatisfactory"
- Emphasizes growth trajectory, not fixed ability

## WHAT'S NEXT: BATCH 1F (POLICIES)

### Scope for Next Session

The POLICIES batch will create remaining course policy documents that govern classroom conduct, technology use, academic integrity, and student support. These documents will **frequently reference** the assessment documents we just created, particularly:

**Primary references**:
- `grading-assessment-content-v101.md` (for grade-related policies)
- `grading-assessment-reasons-v101.md` (for pedagogical philosophy)
- `late-work-policy-content-v101.md` (already created, may be referenced by other policies)

### Documents Needed for Batch 1F

Estimated **6-8 document pairs** (12-16 files):

#### Core Policies (h_policies/)

1. **attendance-policy** (content + reasons)
   - Daily participation expectations
   - Quiz system with 10 lowest dropped

   - Tech support resources (campus IT, instructor help)
   - Backup strategies (OneDrive version history)
   - Device policies (laptops in class for writing)
   - **References**: tech-stack-overview-meta, integration-map-course

6. **classroom-conduct-policy** (content + reasons)
   - Participation expectations (in-class writing, discussions)
   - Respectful peer interaction during review
   - Food/drink, phones, laptops policies
   - What to do if you must miss class
   - **References**: attendance-policy, grading-assessment (participation component)

#### Optional/Conditional Policies

7. **withdrawal-policy** (content + reasons, if needed)
   - Withdrawal deadlines and process
   - When to consider withdrawing vs. persisting
   - Academic advisor consultation
   - Impact on financial aid, progress
   - **References**: grading-assessment (grade preview at Week 8)

   - Campus emergency protocols
   - What happens if instructor is absent
   - Weather-related closures
   - Pandemic-related contingencies
   - **May reference**: late-work (extensions), communication (updates)

### Estimated Token Requirements for Batch 1F

**Based on Batch 1E performance**:
- Average per document pair: ~15 KB content + ~18 KB reasons = ~33 KB total
- Per pair token estimate: ~8,000 tokens
- **6 pairs minimum**: ~48,000 tokens
- **8 pairs maximum**: ~64,000 tokens

**Current remaining budget**: ~81,000 tokens
**Sufficient for**: Full policies batch + ~15,000 token safety margin

### Key Decisions Needed for Batch 1F

**1. AI Use Policy Specificity**
- How explicit to be about generative AI (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)?
- Course emphasizes process documentation—AI use must be documented?
- Blanket prohibition vs. "disclose and reflect" approach?

**2. Attendance Philosophy**
- Current: Daily quizzes with 10 dropped = ~1.5 weeks free absences
- Need explicit "how many absences before concern" threshold?
- Coordinate with late work (missed class → late peer review submission)

**3. Academic Integrity Scope**
- Traditional plagiarism policies assumed
- Need VIRENS-specific angle: process documentation as authenticity evidence?
- Address collaboration (fragments can be discussed, portfolio must be individual?)

**4. Accommodation Coordination**
- Standard DRS boilerplate + course-specific accommodations?
- Which tools have accessibility concerns? (Eli Review web-based, should be fine)
- Process documentation flexibility (written dev logs vs. audio recordings?)

**5. Emergency/Withdrawal Policies**
- Create separate docs or fold into other policies?
- Institutional boilerplate vs. course-specific guidance?

---

## IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

### Cross-Reference Strategy

**Policies will frequently reference assessment docs**:
- Attendance → grading-assessment (quiz points, formative grade)
- Academic integrity → portfolio-requirements (authentic work)
- Accommodations → late-work (extension processes), formative-grading (flexibility)
- Communication → grading-assessment (office hours for grade consultations)

**Use precise anchor links**:
```markdown
See [[grading-assessment-course-v101#Attendance & Participation|quiz policy details]]
```

### Avoid Redundancy

**If information exists in assessment docs, reference rather than repeat**:
- Example: Attendance policy mentions "quizzes worth 5% with 10 dropped"
  - Don't restate full grading breakdown
  - Link to `[[grading-assessment-course-v101#Attendance & Participation]]`

**Create policies that ADD to assessment foundation**:
- Attendance policy: **When** quizzes happen, **why** attendance matters for peer review
- Academic integrity: **How** to cite properly, **what** constitutes plagiarism in this course
- Accommodations: **Which** accommodations apply to which components

### Maintain Dual-Track Structure

**Content notes (student-facing)**:
- Clear, actionable policies
- FAQ sections for common concerns
- Professional but accessible tone
- Explicit about consequences when relevant

**Justification notes (pedagogical rationale)**:
- Theoretical grounding for policy choices
- Alternative approaches considered
- Equity considerations
- Evidence to collect for policy effectiveness
