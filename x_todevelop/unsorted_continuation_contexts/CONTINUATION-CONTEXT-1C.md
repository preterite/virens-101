## KEY CONTENT SOURCES FOR BATCH 1C

**Primary source**: `engl101-course-design-synthesis.md` Section 1.1 (Four Movements Structure)

**Movement details to include**:

| Movement | Weeks | Blocks | Focus | W/P/R Character |
|----------|-------|--------|-------|-----------------|
| M1: Surfacing | 1-3 | ~18 | Expansion, capture, freewriting | W-heavy (~12-13 W, 0-1 P, 3-4 R) |
| M2: Naming | 4-7 | ~22 | Source engagement, structured feedback | Balanced (~8-9 W, 4-5 P, 7-8 R) |
| M3: Operating at Scale | 8-11 | ~25 | Corpus management, consolidation | W+R heavy (~8-9 W, 2-3 P, 10-11 R) |
| M4: Synthesis | 12-15 | ~23 | Portfolio assembly, selection | R-heavy (~2-3 W, 1-2 P, 10-12 R) |

**For each Movement overview, include**:
- Learning objectives specific to that Movement
- Typical week structure (sample schedule)
- Key assignments/milestones
- Fragment production targets
- Connections to six-moves vocabulary
- Transition points (what changes from previous Movement)

## BATCHING STRATEGY UPDATE

Based on Batch 1A-1B token usage:
- **Average tokens per file**: ~2,000-2,500 tokens/file
- **7-8 file batches**: ~14,000-20,000 tokens each
- **Remaining this chat**: Can likely complete 3-4 more batches

**Projected batches for this chat**:
- ✅ Batch 1A: Core theory (7 files) — COMPLETE
- ✅ Batch 1B: Theory + architecture (7 files) — COMPLETE
- ⬜ Batch 1C: Movement overviews (8 files, 4 pairs)
- ⬜ Batch 1D: Tech stack essentials (7-8 files)
- ⬜ Batch 1E: Major assignments (8 files, 4 pairs)
- ⬜ Batch 1F: [If token budget allows]

**Total this chat projection**: ~35-40 files

## QUALITY CHECKPOINTS FOR BATCH 1C

For each Movement overview pair:
1. ✅ Course note uses student-friendly language, accessible examples
2. ✅ Reasons note cites composition pedagogy and systems thinking scholarship
3. ✅ Both notes reference six-moves vocabulary and W/P/R rhythm
4. ✅ Fragment production targets specified for each Movement
5. ✅ Cross-references between paired notes functional
6. ✅ Sample week schedule included in course notes
7. ✅ Theoretical justification for Movement sequence in reasons notes

## FILE NAMING REMINDER

**Pattern for Movement overviews**:
- Course: `M[number]-[movement-name]-overview-course-v101.md`
- Reasons: `M[number]-[movement-name]-overview-reasons-v101.md`

**Examples**:
- `M1-surfacing-overview-course-v101.md`
- `M2-naming-overview-reasons-v101.md`
