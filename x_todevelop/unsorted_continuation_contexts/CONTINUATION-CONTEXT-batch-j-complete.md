## KEY PATTERNS ESTABLISHED

### Course Note Structure (Student-Facing)

**Consistent Format** (150-250 words total):
1. **Context section** (3-4 sentences):
   - When reading is assigned (week, movement)
   - Where students are in semester arc
   - How reading fits immediate course work
   - What challenge/transition reading addresses

2. **Description section** (3-4 sentences):
   - What reading argues/explores
   - Key concepts introduced
   - Main insight or framework
   - Brief, accurate, accessible

3. **Guiding Questions** (2-3 questions):
   - NOT comprehension checks ("what does author say?")
   - NOT difficulty paper prompts (too elaborate)
   - INSTEAD: Connect reading to course concepts
   - Point toward challenging/complex/rich themes
   - Prompt active engagement before/during reading
   - Often use format: "Think about X... How does this connect to Y?"

**Tone**: Second person "you", accessible but not patronizing, assumes intelligence, acknowledges difficulty

### Reasons Note Structure (Scholarly)

**Consistent Sections**:
1. **Design Rationale**: Why this reading (not another), why placed at this week
2. **Theoretical Grounding**: 
   - Composition Pedagogy subsection
   - Systems/Design Thinking subsection
   - Bridges between traditions
3. **Implementation Approach**: How students engage, connection to activities, ongoing application
4. **Competing Values & Tradeoffs**: What reading offers, challenges, how design mitigates
5. **Evidence & Iteration**: What to collect, revision notes
6. **Scholarly Sources**: Direct citations + relevant pedagogy sources

**Tone**: Scholarly register, theoretically grounded, evidence-based, cites extensively

### Strategic Placement Logic

**Reading Distribution Across Movements:**
- **Movement 1** (Surfacing, Weeks 1-3): Ong, Salvatori, Downs → foundational theory
- **Movement 2** (Naming, Weeks 4-7): Kirschenbaum, README, Meadows, Alexander, Bernstein, Jackson → organization, systems, revision
- **Movement 3** (Scale, Weeks 8-11): Borges/Quine, Brooks, Ribes & Jackson, Star → managing complexity, maintenance, infrastructure
- **Movement 4** (Synthesis, Weeks 12-15): Norman, Bush → design vocabulary, historical perspective

**Constraint Sequencing Applied**:
- Experience before theory (students need problems before frameworks)
- Foundational before advanced (Ong before Kirschenbaum, Salvatori before Brooks)
- Difficulty-as-diagnostic established early (Salvatori Week 2)
- Systems vocabulary before systems analysis (Meadows Week 5, Star Week 11)

### Cross-Reference Patterns

**Every reading links to:**
- Its paired note (course ↔ reasons)
- Course principles (04a_theoretical_frameworks, 04b_operationalized_principles)
- Relevant outcomes (outcomes-addressed in YAML)
- Movement context
- Related vocabulary when appropriate
- Related readings when conceptually connected

**Common cross-references:**
- [[04b_operationalized_principles#Difficulty as diagnostic]]
- [[04a_theoretical_frameworks#Systems thinking]]
- [[05_textual_accumulation_and_value]]
- [[12_reading_theory_and_practice]]
- Movement overviews: [[movement1-surfacing-course-v101]], etc.

## THEORETICAL FRAMEWORKS SYNTHESIZED

### Composition Pedagogy Foundations

**Core Scholars Referenced:**
- **Salvatori**: Difficulty as diagnostic, reading-as-writing, conversations with texts
- **Ong**: Writing restructures consciousness, technology of the word
- **Bartholomae**: Discourse communities, inventing the university (dropped from readings but informs pedagogy)
- **Downs & Wardle**: Writing About Writing approach, metalanguage
- **Sommers**: Revision as meaning-making (not error correction)
- **Miller**: Genre as social action

**Key Pedagogical Principles Applied:**
1. Difficulty is informational, not failure (Salvatori)
2. Reading and writing are interconnected (Salvatori)
3. Writing is technology that restructures thought (Ong)
4. Genres coordinate social action (Miller)
5. Revision creates meaning (Sommers, Bernstein)
6. Transfer requires explicit metacognition (Downs, WAW tradition)

### Systems/Design Thinking Integration

**Core Scholars Referenced:**
- **Meadows**: Leverage points, systems dynamics, feedback loops
- **Alexander**: Goodness of fit, misfits, constraint decomposition
- **Norman**: Affordances, constraints, signifiers, feedback
- **Star & Bowker**: Infrastructure invisibility, classification systems
- **Brooks**: Essential vs. accidental complexity, no silver bullet
- **Bush**: Memex, associative thinking, trails

**Key Concepts Applied:**
1. Systems thinking: feedback loops, delays, emergence (Meadows)
2. Design thinking: fit, constraints as enabling, misfits as diagnostic (Alexander)
3. Infrastructure: invisible until breakdown, relational, requires maintenance (Star)
4. Complexity types: essential vs. accidental (Brooks)
5. Associative vs. linear organization (Bush, Jackson)
6. Usability: affordances, signifiers, discoverability (Norman)

### Bridges Between Traditions

**Explicit Connections Made:**
- Salvatori's difficulty ↔ Alexander's misfits (both diagnostic)
- Ong's writing-as-technology ↔ Norman's affordances (tools shape thinking)
- Genre conventions ↔ Design constraints (both enable by limiting)
- Process documentation ↔ Infrastructure maintenance (making invisible visible)
- Accumulation over episodes ↔ Database logic (Bush, Jackson, Manovich)
- Revision as discovery ↔ Iterative design (Bernstein, Schön, Alexander)

## OUTCOMES ALIGNMENT

**Primary Outcomes Addressed by Readings:**

**Critical Thinking** (most frequent):
- Salvatori, Meadows, Brooks, Star, Alexander, Borges/Quine, Bush

**Composing Processes** (very frequent):
- Ong, Salvatori, Kirschenbaum, Bernstein, Jackson, Ribes & Jackson, Norman, Bush, Brooks

**Rhetorical Awareness** (frequent):
- Downs, Meadows, Norman, Bush, Alexander, Star

**Reading-Writing Connection** (specific):
- Salvatori explicitly, others implicitly

**Genre Awareness** (specific):
- README examples, Downs

**Experimental Form** (specific):
- Jackson

---

## CRITICAL DESIGN DECISIONS

### Composite Readings

**README Examples Composite**:
- Rationale: Three README files illustrate genre conventions better than one
- Stack-in-a-box + Day8/re-frame + Standard Readme
- Models for Spec Document assignment

**Borges/Quine/Library Composite**:
- Rationale: Short story + philosophical essay + interactive website provide multifaceted engagement
- Borges (imagination) + Quine (rigor) + libraryofbabel.info (experience)
- Addresses scale/classification/retrieval challenges

### Readings Confirmed Dropped

Per continuation context and synthesis document:
- **Bartholomae "Inventing the University"**: Instructor resource, not student reading
- **Brooks "No Silver Bullet"**: Actually INCLUDED (Week 9) contrary to earlier synthesis notes
- **Wolfram on ChatGPT**: Too dense for required reading

### Week-by-Week Assignments

**Established placement:**
- Week 2: Ong, Salvatori (foundational theory)
- Week 3: Downs (rhetorical vocabulary)
- Week 4: Kirschenbaum (materiality)
- Week 4-5: README examples (documentation genre)
- Week 5: Meadows (systems thinking)
- Week 6: Alexander, Bernstein (constraints, revision)
- Week 7: Jackson (accumulation model)
- Week 8: Borges/Quine/library (scale problems)
- Week 9: Brooks (complexity types)
- Week 10: Ribes & Jackson (maintenance)
- Week 11: Star (infrastructure)
- Week 12: Norman (design vocabulary)
- Week 13: Bush (historical vision)

- Envelope exercise (generative activity)
- Literacy Narrative (milestone, 50 pts)

**Movement 2 (Naming):**
- Spec Document (milestone, 50 pts)
- Constraint Audit (analytical assignment)
- Source work assignments (BEAM tagging, SEAR practice)

**Movement 3 (Operating at Scale):**
- BEAM Portfolio entries (milestone, 50 pts)
- Corpus consolidation work
- Dev log requirements (ongoing)

**Movement 4 (Synthesis):**

- **Reasons note**: Pedagogical rationale, alignment to principles, assessment philosophy

**Structure might include:**
- Overview & Learning Goals
- Full Prompt Text (student-facing)
- Requirements & Specifications
- Timeline & Milestones
- Assessment Criteria (not full rubric, but principles)
- Submission Guidelines
- Related Resources

**Reasons structure:**
- Why This Assignment (not another)
- Theoretical Grounding (composition + systems)
- How It Builds on Prior Work
- How It Prepares for Future Work
- Assessment Philosophy
- Common Challenges & Support Strategies
- Evidence to Collect

### Reading Integration

**Assignments should reference relevant readings:**
- Spec Document uses README examples as models
- Constraint Audit applies Alexander's misfits framework
- Process Archaeology uses Norman's design vocabulary
- BEAM Portfolio builds on source classification from M2

### Cross-References to Establish

**Assignments link to:**
- Course principles that justify them
- Outcomes they address
- Movement overviews
- Readings that inform them
- Activities that prepare for them
- Assessment policies

## WORKING PRINCIPLES REAFFIRMED

### From This Batch

1. **Brevity in course notes**: 150-250 words total is sufficient and respectful of student time
2. **Depth in reasons notes**: 2000-2500 words allows full pedagogical justification
3. **Guiding questions over difficulty papers**: Simpler, more focused, equally effective
4. **Cross-reference promiscuously**: Every note connects to multiple others
5. **Ground in scholarship**: Every pedagogical choice has theoretical foundation
6. **Bridge traditions explicitly**: Composition + systems thinking connections named clearly
7. **Constraint sequencing governs placement**: Experience before theory, always
8. **Composite readings work**: When conceptual wholeness requires multiple texts

### For Next Batch

1. **Assignment prompts must be copy-pasteable**: Students see exactly what they'll get
2. **Requirements must be specific**: Word counts, format specs, submission details
3. **Assessment must be transparent**: Students understand how work will be evaluated
4. **Scaffolding must be explicit**: How each assignment builds on prior work
5. **Integration must be clear**: How readings, activities, assignments connect
6. **Flexibility must be preserved**: Generic enough for adaptation across semesters

---

## FILE NAMING CONVENTIONS

**Established patterns:**
- `{reading-slug}-course-v101.md` for course notes
- `{reading-slug}-reasons-v101.md` for justification notes
- Slugs use hyphens, lowercase, identify content clearly
- Version indicator `v101` consistent across all notes

**For assignments:**
- `{assignment-name}-course-v101.md`
- `{assignment-name}-reasons-v101.md`
- Examples: `literacy-narrative-course-v101.md`, `spec-document-course-v101.md`
