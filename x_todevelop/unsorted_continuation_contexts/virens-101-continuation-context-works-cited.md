## Reading List Status

### Confirmed Readings (with full citations in sources-inventory-v101.md)

| Week | Reading | Pages | Status |
|------|---------|-------|--------|
| W1 | Kirschenbaum, "Prepare for the Textpocalypse" | ~10 | ✅ Confirmed |
| W2 | Ong, "Writing Restructures Consciousness" | ~25-30 | ✅ Confirmed |
| W2 | README Examples Composite | ~5-10 | ✅ Confirmed |
| W3 | Salvatori, "Conversations with Texts" | ~15 | ✅ Confirmed |
| W5 | Meadows, "Leverage Points" | ~20 | ✅ Confirmed |
| W7 | Alexander, *Notes on the Synthesis of Form* (selections) | ~20-25 | ✅ Confirmed |
| W8 | Brooks, "No Silver Bullet" | ~20 | ✅ Confirmed |
| W10 | Star, "Ethnography of Infrastructure" | ~15 | ✅ Confirmed |
| W10 | Bush, "As We May Think" | ~12 | ✅ Confirmed |
| W11 | Ribes & Jackson, "Data Bite Man" | ~20 | ✅ Confirmed |
| W12 | Norman, "Psychopathology of Everyday Things" | ~35 | ✅ Confirmed |
| W13 | Bernstein, "Blood on the Cutting Room Floor" | ~8 | ✅ Confirmed |

**Confirmed total**: ~205-220 pages

### TBD Readings (Gaps to Remedy)

| Week | Need | Candidates | Decision Criteria |
|------|------|------------|-------------------|
| W4 | Rhetorical situation introduction | Bitzer "Rhetorical Situation" (~14 pp); Downs excerpt; Writing Spaces chapter | Accessibility for FYC; foundational vs. complicated |
| W6 | Classification/organization | Star excerpt on classification; practical taxonomy reading | Supports corpse→compost transition; classification move |
| W7 | Peer review practice | Writing Spaces chapter on peer review | Practical guidance; pairs with Alexander's theoretical density |

**Notes on candidates**:

**W4 Rhetorical Situation**:
- *Bitzer* is canonical but somewhat abstract
- *Downs* (from project knowledge references) may be more accessible
- Writing Spaces offers free, student-friendly options
- Consider: Does W4 need a reading, or is rhetorical situation better introduced through activity with reading support later?

**W6 Classification**:
- Star & Bowker excerpt on classification consequences could work but may be too dense
- Practical reading on organizing research might serve better
- Consider: W6 is corpse→compost week—does classification reading support that transition?

**W7 Peer Review**:
- Writing Spaces has several peer review chapters
- This pairs with Alexander (dense theoretical) so peer review reading should be practical/light
- Consider: Is peer review reading necessary, or is Eli Review training sufficient?

## Reading Rhythm Analysis: Framework

### Page Budget Parameters

**Established constraints** (from project knowledge):
- Target: 200-250 pages total semester (conservative); up to 350-400 (generous)
- Confirmed readings: ~205-220 pages
- Remaining budget: ~30-180 pages depending on target

### Pages Per Week (Current)

| Week | Reading | Pages | Block Type | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|------------|-------|
| W1 | Kirschenbaum | 10 | Light | Course entry; envelope exercise priority |
| W2 | Ong + READMEs | 30-40 | Medium-Heavy | Tech instruction blocks reduce reading time |
| W3 | Salvatori | 15 | Medium | First "difficult" reading |
| W4 | TBD | ? | TBD | |
| W5 | Meadows | 20 | Medium | Systems vocabulary |
| W6 | TBD | ? | TBD | |
| W7 | Alexander + TBD? | 20-25+ | Heavy | Difficulty pair B1 |
| W8 | Brooks | 20 | Medium | Essential/accidental complexity |
| W9 | None | 0 | Conference | |
| W10 | Star + Bush | 27 | Heavy | Difficulty pair A2 + graph thinking return |
| W11 | Ribes & Jackson | 20 | Medium | Maintenance labor |
| W12 | Norman | 35 | Heavy | Affordances for Process Archaeology |
| W13 | Bernstein | 8 | Light | Revision week; writing focus |
| W14 | None | 0 | Presentations | |
| W15 | None | 0 | Portfolio | |

### Reading Rhythm Patterns to Verify

1. **Heavy weeks** (25+ pages): W2, W7, W10, W12
   - Do these align with lighter activity loads?
   - W7 and W10 are difficulty pairs—intentionally challenging

2. **Light weeks** (0-15 pages): W1, W3, W9, W13, W14, W15
   - W9, W14, W15 have no reading (appropriate)
   - W1 and W13 are light to allow focus on exercises

3. **Medium weeks** (15-25 pages): W5, W8, W11
   - Should be sustainable baseline

4. **TBD weeks** (W4, W6): Need to fit pattern
   - W4 follows heavy W2/W3—should be light-medium
   - W6 precedes heavy W7—should be light-medium

### Documented Inquiry Research Page Budget

**Key question**: When do students read their *own* research sources?

- **BEAM Portfolio work**: W7-W11 (students accumulating sources)
- **Documented Inquiry drafting**: W11-W13

**Implication**: Weeks 10-12 have both assigned readings AND student research reading. Norman (W12, 35 pages) is the heaviest assigned reading during this period.

**Recommendation**: Keep W11 and W13 light on assigned reading to accommodate research reading. Current plan:
- W11: Ribes & Jackson (20 pp) — could be reduced or made optional
- W13: Bernstein (8 pp) — appropriately light

## Decision Points for Next Session

### 1. W4 Reading Decision

**Options**:
A. Bitzer "Rhetorical Situation" (~14 pp) — canonical but abstract
B. Downs excerpt (from *Writing About Writing*?) — more accessible
C. Writing Spaces chapter — free, student-friendly
D. No reading; teach rhetorical situation through activity

**Factors**:
- W4 is first week of M2 (Naming)—transition from generating to organizing
- SEAR procedure introduced this week
- Follows heavy reading W2-W3

**Recommendation**: Light reading or activity-based introduction. If reading, Writing Spaces option.

### 2. W6 Reading Decision

**Options**:
A. Star & Bowker excerpt on classification — connects to W10 Star
B. Practical classification/taxonomy reading — supports corpse→compost
C. No additional reading; classification taught through activity

**Factors**:
- W6 is corpse→compost transition week
- Precedes heavy Alexander (W7)
- Classification move is foregrounded

**Recommendation**: Light practical reading on organizing research, or no reading.

### 3. W7 Peer Review Reading Decision

**Options**:
A. Writing Spaces peer review chapter — practical skills
B. No reading; Eli Review training suffices

**Factors**:
- W7 already has Alexander (20-25 pp, difficult)
- Peer review is skill, not content
- Eli Review has built-in training

**Recommendation**: No additional reading. Eli Review training + Alexander is sufficient.

### 4. Page Budget Allocation

**If generous budget (~350 pp)**:
- Add W4 reading (~15 pp)
- Keep W6 light or no reading
- Total: ~235-250 pp with buffer for research reading

**If conservative budget (~250 pp)**:
- W4: Activity-based, no reading
- W6: No reading
- Total: ~205-220 pp

## Sources Inventory Enhancements Needed

### For Works Cited Generation

1. **Formatting consistency**: Verify all entries follow MLA 9th exactly
2. **Access information**: Add URLs for online sources; note which are in project as PDFs
3. **Student vs. instructor distinction**: Clear separation for syllabus vs. comprehensive bibliography

### For Reasons Notes Population

1. **Concept tagging**: Which concepts does each source support?
2. **Quotation bank**: Key quotations with page numbers for easy insertion
3. **Cross-reference map**: Which reasons notes will cite which sources?

### YAML Field Population

When generating reasons notes, `cites-scholars` field should list surnames only:
```yaml
cites-scholars: [Salvatori, Bartholomae, Elbow]
primary-theorist: "Salvatori"
```

## Workflow for Next Session

### Step 1: Reading Rhythm Inventory

Create detailed pages-per-block analysis:
- Calculate pages per 25-minute block (estimate: 8-12 pages depending on difficulty)
- Map reading load against activity intensity
- Identify weeks with overhead for additions vs. weeks at capacity

### Step 2: Resolve Reading Gaps

Make decisions on W4, W6, W7 readings based on:
- Page budget
- Rhythm analysis
- Pedagogical fit

### Step 3: Research Reading Budget

Identify weeks 10-13 research reading expectations:
- How many sources should students read for BEAM Portfolio?
- How many pages per source?
- Total research reading load during Documented Inquiry drafting?

### Step 4: Publication Verification

Work through Priority 1 verification list:
- Check PDFs in project for exact page numbers
- Confirm edition details
- Determine Alexander excerpt scope

### Step 5: Generate Formatted Works Cited

From sources-inventory-v101.md, produce:
- Student syllabus works cited (Part 1 only)
- Comprehensive bibliography (Parts 1-4)
- Annotated reading list for administrator package
