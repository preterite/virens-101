### 3. Folder Structure

```
ENGL101-Portfolio/
├── 01-Fragments/
│   ├── M1-Surfacing/
│   ├── M2-Naming/
│   ├── M3-Scale/
│   └── M4-Synthesis/
├── 02-Process/
│   ├── dev-logs/
│   └── system-maps/
├── 03-Submissions/
│   ├── submitted/
│   └── returned/
└── 04-Resources/
    └── [handouts, examples]
```

### 4. Naming Convention

**Format**: `YYYY-MM-DD-topic-slug-status.docx`

**Example**: `2026-02-14-salvatori-difficulty-draft.docx`

**Rationale**:
- Date-first: Chronological sorting, visible accumulation
- Topic-slug: Search-friendly, forces metacognition about content
- Status: Tracks workflow (draft/revised/polished/submitted)

### 5. Index Card System

**Front**:
- Date
- Source (author, title)
- Core idea or quotation
- Tags: Movement (M1-M4) + Status (?/!/↑/✓)

**Back**:
- Connections to other cards/ideas
- Questions raised
- Next steps for development

**Tags**:
- **Movement**: M1 (Surfacing), M2 (Naming), M3 (Scale), M4 (Synthesis)
- **Status**: ? (question), ! (important), ↑ (follow up), ✓ (completed)

### 6. Eli Review Integration

**Week 2**: Ungraded familiarization cycle
- Students practice giving/receiving feedback with no stakes
- Learn Describe-Evaluate-Suggest model
- Experience helpfulness ratings

**Week 5**: First graded cycle
- 3 weeks after familiarization (buffer for learning)
- Coincides with Zotero library session (source-based work begins)
- Helpfulness ratings now count toward peer review grade

**6 graded cycles total**: ~40 pts each = 240 pts (24% of course grade)

### 7. Digital Transfer Timing (Week 8)

**Why Week 8**:
- Corpus at ~25 fragments (scale justifies digital organization)
- M3 "Operating at Scale" begins
- Students have established capture habits on cards
- Time to learn search/retrieval strategies for growing corpus

**"What You're Automating" session**:
- Maps card organization strategies to folder structure
- Explains version control through OneDrive
- Teaches filename-based search
- Demonstrates connection-building across fragments

### 8. Six Moves Vocabulary

**Operationalized across tools**:

| Move | Definition | Primary Tool | Secondary Tools |
|------|------------|--------------|-----------------|
| Capture | Get idea out immediately | Index cards | Word (in-class) |
| Classify | Identify material type | Card sorting | Zotero tags (BEAM) |
| Route | Send to appropriate location | Folder structure | Naming convention |
| Distill | Extract essential insight | Revision in Word | Eli feedback |
| Connect | Link related items | Card back notes | Zotero related |
| Publish | Generate outputs | Word + Canvas | — |

## CROSS-REFERENCES ESTABLISHED

### To Movement Overviews

- **M1-Surfacing**: Index cards introduced, folder structure established
- **M2-Naming**: Zotero library session, BEAM tagging begins
- **M3-Scale**: Digital transfer, corpus management strategies
- **M4-Synthesis**: Portfolio assembly using accumulated tools

### To Assessment Structure

- **Eli Review cycles**: 6 × 40 pts = 240 pts (24% of grade)
- **Dev logs**: 10 × 10 pts = 100 pts (10% of grade)
- **Fragment accumulation**: Evidence in portfolio

### To Pedagogical Principles

- **Constraint sequencing**: Tools when needed, not before
- **Process documentation**: Dev logs, system maps make labor visible
- **Failure-as-diagnostic**: Low-stakes Eli intro before graded cycles
- **Manual trigger points**: Students decide when to transfer/develop

---

## ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED AND REJECTED

### Path B: OneNote-Centered

**Structure**: OneNote as central hub, sections for fragments, pages for process docs

**Rejected because**:
- Steeper learning curve (hierarchical structure non-obvious)
- Loses tactile engagement of index cards
- Requires more tech instruction time
- Splits cohort (not all students comfortable with OneNote)

**Documented for**: Future semesters, advanced students, optional Path B materials created

### Path C: Hybrid with Obsidian

**Structure**: Obsidian for instructor, students use simplified tools

**Rejected because**:
- Too complex for required use in first-year course
- Would split cohort into "advanced" and "standard" paths
- Maintenance burden high (two parallel systems)
- Students benefit from shared troubleshooting

**Documented for**: Individual student experiments, future iterations

### Why Path A (Eli-Centered)

**Advantages**:
1. Proven pedagogy (Eli Review research-backed)
2. Built-in training materials reduce instructor burden
3. Cross-platform compatibility (all tools work on any device)
4. Clear separation of concerns (each tool does one thing well)
5. Adoptable by other instructors without heavy customization
6. Cost-effective ($30-35 vs. $100+ alternatives)

## SUCCESS METRICS (by Week 12)

**Students should be able to**:
1. Find any fragment in their corpus within 30 seconds
2. See what they have at a glance (folder structure + dev log)
3. Trace a fragment's history (version naming + OneDrive versions)
4. Connect fragments to sources (Zotero integration)
5. Review feedback patterns (Eli analytics dashboard)
6. Reflect on process (dev log as evidence)

**Evidence of success**:
- Students arrive at portfolio assembly with organized corpus
- Dev logs show growing sophistication in process awareness
- Eli helpfulness ratings remain high (average >3.5/5)
- Troubleshooting requests decrease after Week 10
- Students volunteer examples of "system working for them"

---

## COMMON STUDENT ISSUES & SOLUTIONS

### Access Problems

**"Can't log into Eli Review"**
- Check email for invitation
- Reset password through Eli platform
- Contact instructor for new access code

**"OneDrive not syncing"**
- Verify campus account active
- Check storage quota (should be 1TB at WSU)
- Restart OneDrive app

**"Zotero Word plugin not working"**
- Reinstall plugin from Zotero preferences
- Check Word security settings (Mac especially)
- Use campus IT deployment package if available

### Organizational Confusion

**"Lost my index cards"**
- No digital backup for physical media
- Start fresh, use this as reflection opportunity
- Consider dev log entry: "What I learned about backups"

**"Forgot naming convention"**
- Provide quick-reference card
- Schedule 30-min cleanup session
- Dev log entry: "Reorganizing my file system"

**"Too many fragments, can't find anything"**
- This is good problem (means accumulation working!)
- Review search strategies from T5 session
- Consider better tagging on cards before transfer

### Process Documentation Resistance

**"Don't know what to write in dev log"**
- Use three-part structure: Did / Happened / Learned
- Focus on problems/surprises, not successes
- Examples: "Naming files is harder than I thought"

**"System map feels overwhelming"**
- Start simple (just boxes and arrows)
- Draft in Week 3, revise for portfolio
- This is documentation, not art

## WHAT'S NEXT

### Batch 1E: Assessment Documentation

**Next batch should cover**:
1. Portfolio structure and requirements
2. Portfolio assessment rubric (traditional + spec-doc + process criteria)
3. Grade breakdown (50% portfolio + 50% formative)
4. Dev log assessment (completion vs. quality)
5. Participation/engagement criteria
6. Reflective cover letter guidelines
7. Eli Review grading integration

**Why assessment next**:
- Grading philosophy determines assignment design
- Students need clarity on evaluation before major work
- Assessment establishes course values (what's evaluated = what matters)
- Feeds into syllabus (grade breakdown must be specified)

### Future Batches

**After assessment**:
- Policies (attendance, late work, AI use, accommodations)
- Outcomes (WPA, UCORE, Framework for Success alignment)
- Assignments (literacy narrative, spec document, BEAM portfolio, etc.)
- Readings (individual reading guides with justifications)
- Weekly schedules (block-by-block plans)
- Syllabus (assembled from all components)
