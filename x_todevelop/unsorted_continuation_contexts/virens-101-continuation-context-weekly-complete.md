# VIRENS 101 Course Design: Continuation Context Document

**Created**: 2026-01-24
**Purpose**: Comprehensive summary for continuing course design work in new conversations
**Current Phase**: Weekly index notes COMPLETE; moving to works cited and batch template additions

---

## Project Overview

VIRENS 101 is an innovative first-year composition course integrating composition pedagogy with systems thinking, design processes, and material hermeneutics. The course treats writing as both labor and capital, embraces process documentation and constraint sequencing, and draws on 25 years of classroom practice alongside practices from software development and design engineering.

**Instructor**: Michael Edwards (rhetoric and composition scholar, 25 years teaching experience)
**Institution**: Washington State University
**Course**: English 101 (first-year composition)
**Structure**: 15 weeks, 6 blocks per week (25 minutes each), 24-student cohort
**Assessment**: 50% portfolio, 50% formative work

## Four Movements Structure

| Movement | Weeks | Name | Core Activity | Permission Shift |
|----------|-------|------|---------------|------------------|
| M1 | 1-3 | Surfacing | Generate fragments, build systems | Full private write access |
| M2 | 4-7 | Naming | Classify, organize, begin sharing | Peer review grants read access |
| M3 | 8-11 | Operating at Scale | Manage corpus, develop projects | Developing read/write access to academic discourse |
| M4 | 12-15 | Synthesis | Select, polish, reflect | Work becomes fixed and visible |

**Threshold**: Week 9 (conferences) falls between M2 and M3 as deliberate transition point.

## Major Conceptual Arcs

### Corpse → Compost → Garden
- **W6**: Corpse→compost introduced (raw fragments as dead material)
- **W8**: Deepened (transformation through work)
- **W11-12**: Garden stage (growth, tending)
- **W13**: "Planted garden grows" / flourishing
- **W15**: Portfolio as snapshot of current flourishing

### Permission Flags
- **W7**: Preview (light introduction)
- **W13**: Full treatment (explicit Unix model, rwx notation, power relations)
- **W15**: Retrospective (tracing semester-long permission shifts)

### Textual Accumulation
- **W1**: Introduced implicitly
- **W2**: Made explicit (labor creates capital)
- Throughout: Operational (fragment quotas, corpus building)
- **W15**: Culminates in portfolio as accumulated capital

### Graph Thinking
- **W2**: Introduced (ideas as network, not list)
- **W10**: Returns with Bush's "associative trails" and memex vision

## Key Quotations Used in Syntheses

### Week 1 - Kirschenbaum
- "Prepare for the Textpocalypse" framing

### Week 2 - Ong
- "By contrast with natural, oral speech, writing is completely artificial. There is no way to write 'naturally'."
- "Technologies are not mere exterior aids but also interior transformations of consciousness, and never more than when they affect the word."

### Week 3 - Salvatori
- "Conversations with Texts" difficulty pedagogy
- Returns in W13 (Burke's parlor connection)

### Week 10 - Star
- Ethnography of infrastructure
- "When" something becomes infrastructure

### Week 10 - Bush
- "As We May Think" associative trails
- Memex vision

### Week 11 - Ribes & Jackson
- "composting" vocabulary
- Maintenance labor

### Week 12 - Norman
- Affordances, constraints, signifiers, feedback
- Design vocabulary for Process Archaeology

### Week 13 - Bernstein
- "writing is an artificial intelligence—*intelligence* in the sense of having a power over mind, *artificial* in the sense of transpersonal and nonhuman"
- "psychic surgery—knitting together pieces of deanimated flesh until, like the monster in Mary Shelley's *Frankenstein*, they come alive"
- "Consider a work composed of a number of autonomously distinct pieces, which nonetheless functions as a whole by articulating the relations among the parts"
- "blood on the cutting room floor"

### Week 13 - Burke
- "unending conversation" / parlor metaphor (for cyclical publish framing)

---

## Key Decisions Made During Generation

### Synthesis Style
- ~800-1200 words per week (varies by content density)
- Quotations integrated with interpretive commentary
- Concepts introduced with definitions and applications
- Forward/backward connections to other weeks explicit

### ONESIES Format
- Definition
- Application to writing/course
- Key quotation (where applicable)
- "Returns in" forward reference (where applicable)

### Block Plans
- 25-minute blocks with Opening (2-3 min) / Main (20-21 min) / Closing (2 min)
- Activity types: W (Writing), R (Revision), T (Tech), P (Peer review), I (Instructor feedback)
- Specific facilitation guidance included

### Permission Flags
- Unix model made explicit (rwx, owner/group/others)
- Used both for file permissions metaphor AND for read/write access to academic discourse
- Traced across semester as developmental arc

### Envelope Exercise
- W1 questions: hopes, worries, existing knowledge, expectations
- W15 questions: surprises, difficulties, skills, satisfaction
- Parallel gaps offered as optional heuristic for reflection (not required)
- Staging: write W15 responses BEFORE returning envelopes

### Graph Thinking
- Introduced W2 with concrete example (five-paragraph essay / AI connection)
- Returns W10 with Bush's associative trails

### Corpse→Garden
- Explicit arc tracked through synthesis sections
- "Planted garden grows" in W13
- Portfolio as "snapshot of what's flourishing" in W15

---

## Open Questions for Future Sessions

1. **Week 14 template**: Presentations week—does it need a formal template or just a placeholder note?

2. **Reasons notes priority**: Generate paired justification notes for all weeks, or prioritize certain weeks?

3. **Movement overviews**: Generate as standalone documents or let weekly notes serve that function?

4. **Assignment templates**: Which assignments need full templates beyond what's referenced in weekly notes?

5. **Reading schedule verification**: Confirm all readings are correctly placed in schedule (some weeks noted as "check file")

6. **Tech guides completeness**: Audit existing tech guides against what weekly notes reference

---

## Workflow Notes for Continuation

### File Generation Process
1. Draft synthesis in conversation (with user review/revision)
2. Generate full template with all sections
3. Save to `/mnt/user-data/outputs/`
4. Present file to user
5. User moves to local vault

### Template Structure (Weekly Overviews)
```

## Summary

**Completed**: All 15 weekly overview templates
**Next**: Works cited document, then batch template additions (assignments, frameworks, movement overviews, reasons notes)
**Key arcs secured**: Six-move framework, corpse→garden, permission flags, graph thinking, difficulty pairs, ONESIES
**All ONESIES accounted for**: Introduced in appropriate weeks with forward/backward connections

The weekly index notes phase is complete. The course now has a full semester of student-facing synthesis content with block-by-block teaching plans.
