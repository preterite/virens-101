# VIRENS 101 Weekly Overview Notes: Continuation Context

**Created**: 2026-01-23
**Purpose**: Preserve project state for continuation across sessions
**Next Action**: Complete Week 4, then reassess concept coverage matrix

---

## Project Overview

Generating complete weekly index notes for VIRENS 101, an innovative first-year composition course integrating composition pedagogy with systems thinking. Each week requires a synthesis section (~600-900 words) plus full template sections (At a Glance, Reading, Block-by-Block, Assignments, Prompts, Peer Review, Tech, Fragments, Connections, Instructor Notes, Concepts).

### Generation Strategy

**Original plan**: Anchored weeks first (readings/assignments lock sequence), then flexible weeks.

**Revised approach**: After completing anchored weeks 1, 3, 6, 8, we're shifting to:
1. Complete Week 4 (SEAR explicitly taught, M2 opening)
2. Pause to compare concept matrix against remaining weeks
3. Determine optimal sequence for remaining weeks based on coverage gaps

## Concept Tracking Status

### ONESIES (Single Introduction Point) — Status

| Concept | Week | Status |
|---------|------|--------|
| Difficulty-as-diagnostic | 3 | ✅ SECURED |
| Metacognitive interruption | 3 | ✅ SECURED |
| Essential vs. accidental complexity | 8 | ✅ SECURED |
| Graceful degradation | 8 | ✅ SECURED (DANGER ZONE) |
| Experimental form | 6 | ✅ SECURED |
| Infrastructure invisibility | 10 | Pending |
| Memex vision | 10 | Pending |
| Boundary objects | 10 | Pending |
| Maintenance labor | 11 | Pending |
| Affordances | 12 | Pending |
| Process archaeology | 13 | Pending |

### DANGER ZONES (Risk of Mishandling) — Status

| Concept | Risk | Status |
|---------|------|--------|
| Graceful degradation | Could become excuse for sloppiness | ✅ ADDRESSED W8: "not load-bearing walls; modular components" |
| Six-move vocabulary | Could become mechanical checklist | Introduced W1, varied across weeks |
| Mill/store metaphor | Could oversimplify | Deepened W8 with Babbage context |
| Constraint sequencing | Could seem arbitrary | Built across W1, W3, W6, W8 |

### Difficulty Pairs — Status

| Pair | Reading 1 | Week | Reading 2 | Week | Status |
|------|-----------|------|-----------|------|--------|
| A | Salvatori | 3 | Star | 10 | ✅ BEGINS W3, explicit setup for W10 |
| B | Meadows | 5 | Alexander | 7 | Pending both endpoints |

## Key Decisions Made

### Structural Decisions

1. **Synthesis length**: ~600-900 words, 7-10 paragraphs
2. **Quotation handling**: 1-3 key quotes per week, integrated with interpretation (models textual work)
3. **Historical contextualization**: Brief bios for unfamiliar figures (Hopper, Babbage, etc.)
4. **Concept introduction**: Name concepts explicitly when introduced; vary language when deepening
5. **Thematic threading**: Werewolves/gardens/transformation arc (W6-8); difficulty/visibility arc (W3-10)

### Content Decisions

1. **Envelope timing**: Envelope exercise (W1) returns only in W15; W3 revision uses early fragments, not envelope
2. **SEAR procedure**: Briefly introduced W4, expanded W6; needs explicit teaching in W4
3. **BEAM framework**: Introduced conceptually W6, applied W7
4. **Dev log**: Started W3, continues through semester
5. **Caring voice**: Include brief supportive reminders in difficult weeks ("It's okay for this material to be challenging...")

### Process Decisions

1. **Quotation selection**: When using theoretical texts, propose 3 candidates for user selection
2. **User consultation**: Ask clarifying questions about connections, emphasis, and framing before full generation
3. **Revision integration**: When user provides quotations or language, integrate verbatim or near-verbatim

## Week 4 Specifications (Next to Generate)

### From Schedule

**Week 4** — M2: Naming begins
| Block | Type | Activity |
|-------|------|----------|
| 1 | W | Source-based writing introduction |
| 2 | W | SEAR tutorial + practice |
| 3 | W | Literacy Narrative completion *(Prompt 4.3 available)* |
| 4 | P | **Eli Review Cycle 1: Literacy Narrative** |
| 5 | R | Eli Review helpfulness + revision planning |
| 6 | R | Revision based on Cycle 1 feedback |

**Reading**: Downs [[@downs2007teaci]] excerpt (~15 pages)
**Tech**: Eli Review Cycle 1 (first formal use)
**Peer Review**: Cycle 1 (Generous/SPQ)
**Due**: Literacy Narrative draft (end of week)
**Fragment count**: M1 complete (8-12); M2 begins

### From Inventory

**Concepts to introduce**: Rhetorical situation, Audience awareness
**Concepts to deepen**: Fragment production
**SEAR**: Must be explicitly taught (Situate, Embed, Analyze, Relate)

### Key Week 4 Tasks

1. **SEAR explicit teaching**: Full specification of the procedure
   - Situate: Who's speaking, from what position, why should we listen
   - Embed: Make it part of your sentence
   - Analyze: Don't let source speak for itself
   - Relate: So what? Why does this matter here?

2. **M1→M2 transition**: Movement from personal narrative to source-based writing

3. **Eli Review Cycle 1**: First formal peer review; Generous response + SPQ

4. **Rhetorical situation vocabulary**: Downs provides the framework

### Questions to Resolve Before Generating

1. **Downs excerpt**: Which specific excerpt? Need to confirm source for accurate framing.
2. **SEAR depth**: How much procedural detail in synthesis vs. separate handout reference?
3. **M1→M2 framing**: How to honor Literacy Narrative completion while pivoting to source work?

| 4 | M2 | **NEXT** | Downs, SEAR explicit, M1→M2 transition | High priority |
| 5 | M2 | Semi-anchored | Meadows, Difficulty Pair B begins | Pair B endpoint |

| 14 | M4 | Flexible | Presentations, no reading | Low content |
| 15 | M4 | Anchored | Final, envelope return | Semester closure |

### Post-Week-4 Reassessment

After completing Week 4, we'll:
1. Review concept coverage matrix
2. Identify any gaps in high-frequency concept introduction/deepening
3. Determine whether to continue with Pair B completion (5, 7) or address other priorities
4. Assess remaining ONESIE placement

## Workflow Established

### For Each Week

1. **Pull context**: Inventory entry + schedule details for target week
2. **Identify requirements**: OONESIEs to secure, concepts to introduce/deepen, difficulty pair status
3. **Clarify with user**: Key quotations, thematic connections, emphasis decisions
4. **Draft synthesis**: ~600-900 words integrating reading, concepts, forward/backward links
5. **Generate full template**: All sections populated per weekly-index-template.md
6. **Present for review**: User approval before considering complete

### Quotation Protocol (for theoretical readings)

1. Propose 3 candidate passages: (A) condense core insights, (B) vivid/memorable
2. User selects or provides alternatives
3. Integrate with interpretation (model textual work students will learn)

### Thematic Threading

- **Transformation arc**: Classification (W6) → Werewolves/gardens (W8) → grown not built
- **Visibility arc**: Salvatori difficulty (W3) → Star infrastructure (W10)
- **Intervention arc**: Meadows leverage (W5) → Alexander fit (W7)
- **Conversation across time**: Envelope (W1) → return (W15); fragments → revision → portfolio
