This article documents the design of VIRENS 101, a first-year composition course integrating systems thinking with composition pedagogy through constraint structure—the deliberate sequencing of writing constraints to enable textual accumulation over time.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>The innovation lies not in any single assignment but in temporal architecture: when constraints arrive matters as much as what they are. Students move through four movements across fifteen weeks, each introducing constraints that become infrastructure for subsequent work.</p>

                    <h2>The Six Moves Framework</h2>

                    <p>The course organizes around six fundamental moves that structure how writers interact with source material and develop arguments. These moves—capture, classify, route, distill, connect, and publish—provide vocabulary for making visible the usually invisible labor of composition.</p>

                    <div class="paper-inset">
                        <h3>Capture</h3>
                        <p>Students begin by capturing fragments on index cards during reading. This low-tech constraint makes note-taking visible and portable, separating the act of recording from the act of organizing.</p>

                        <h3>Classify</h3>
                        <p>The BEAM taxonomy (Background, Exhibit, Argument, Method) provides categories for understanding how sources function in academic writing. Classification transforms the undifferentiated "research" into distinct rhetorical purposes.</p>

                        <h3>Route</h3>
                        <p>Feedback systems route drafts through peer review and instructor conferences. Routing makes visible that writing circulates through social systems, not just from writer to reader.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h2>Archives Give You Analytics</h2>

                    <p>The course design foregrounds a key insight from infrastructure studies: archives give you analytics for intervention. By requiring systematic documentation of composing processes, students create datasets about their own writing practices. These archives become resources for reflection and sites for quantitative rhetoric.</p>

                    <ul class="organic-list">
                        <li>Development logs track daily writing sessions and difficulties encountered</li>
                        <li>Constraint audits document which requirements proved hardest to meet</li>
                        <li>Process archaeology reviews early drafts to understand transformation</li>
                        <li>BEAM portfolios organize sources by rhetorical function</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>The relationship between archive and analytics matters pedagogically. Numbers become points for intervention rather than instruments of judgment. Students learn to read their own data, identifying patterns in their composing habits and selecting focal problems for inquiry.</p>

                    <div class="pullquote-organic">
                        <span class="quote-mark">"</span>
                        <p class="quote-text">When constraints arrive matters as much as what they are.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h2>Implications for Composition Studies</h2>

                    <p>This approach suggests several directions for future work. First, composition needs more robust integration of systems thinking, particularly concepts from infrastructure studies and design theory. Second, the field would benefit from recovering Peter Elbow's process pedagogy against social turn critiques that misconstrue individual practice as asocial.</p>

                    <p>Most significantly, constraint structure provides alternative to genre theory's emphasis on uptake and situation. Rather than writers shaped by social forces, this framework positions writers as system designers who accumulate capital through deliberate constraint adoption.</p>
