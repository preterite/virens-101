                    <h1>Economies of Composition</h1>
                    
                    <p class="lead">Writing operates as technology that substitutes capital for labor. This article documents the design of VIRENS 101, a first-year composition course integrating systems thinking with composition pedagogy through constraint structure—the deliberate sequencing of writing constraints to enable textual accumulation over time.</p>

                    <p>The innovation lies not in any single assignment but in temporal architecture: when constraints arrive matters as much as what they are. Students move through four movements across fifteen weeks, each introducing constraints that become infrastructure for subsequent work.</p>

                    <div class="bold-box">
                        <h3>Key Insight</h3>
                        <p>Economy already operates inside the classroom. Every constraint is technology. Every technology performs economic function. Traditional pedagogy obscures these relationships; constraint structure makes them visible.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h2>The Six Moves Framework</h2>

                    <p>The course organizes around six fundamental moves that structure how writers interact with source material and develop arguments. These moves—capture, classify, route, distill, connect, and publish—provide vocabulary for making visible the usually invisible labor of composition.</p>

                    <h3>Capture and Classify</h3>

                    <p>Students begin by capturing fragments on index cards during reading. This low-tech constraint makes note-taking visible and portable, separating the act of recording from the act of organizing. The BEAM taxonomy (Background, Exhibit, Argument, Method) then provides categories for understanding how sources function in academic writing.</p>

                    <ul class="content-list">
                        <li>Index cards enforce one idea per card, preventing premature organization</li>
                        <li>Physical manipulation makes classification tactile and reversible</li>
                        <li>BEAM categories transform undifferentiated "research" into rhetorical purposes</li>
                        <li>Classification becomes visible infrastructure for later synthesis</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Route and Distill</h3>

                    <p>Feedback systems route drafts through peer review and instructor conferences. Routing makes visible that writing circulates through social systems, not just from writer to reader. Students then distill portfolios from accumulated fragments, learning to select and organize material strategically.</p>

                    <div class="bold-box">
                        <h3>Archives Give Analytics</h3>
                        <p>By requiring systematic documentation of composing processes, students create datasets about their own writing practices. These archives become resources for reflection and sites for quantitative rhetoric. Numbers become points for intervention rather than instruments of judgment.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h2>Constraint Sequencing</h2>

                    <p>The relationship between constraint arrival and textual accumulation matters pedagogically. Early constraints establish baseline practices—capturing ideas, classifying sources, routing drafts. Middle constraints build on this infrastructure—distilling portfolios, connecting arguments across sources. Late constraints enable synthesis—selecting focal problems, publishing arguments.</p>

                    <p>What begins as labor becomes stored capability. The index card system that initially feels cumbersome becomes second nature. The BEAM taxonomy that requires conscious application becomes automatic recognition. The routing protocols that seem artificial become natural circulation patterns.</p>

                    <h2>Implications for the Field</h2>

                    <p>This approach suggests several directions for future work in composition studies. First, the field needs more robust integration of systems thinking, particularly concepts from infrastructure studies and design theory. Second, composition would benefit from recovering process pedagogy against social turn critiques that misconstrue individual practice as asocial.</p>

                    <p>Most significantly, constraint structure provides alternative to genre theory's emphasis on uptake and situation. Rather than writers shaped by social forces, this framework positions writers as system designers who accumulate capital through deliberate constraint adoption. The writer's past becomes store rather than formation—accumulated capability rather than social shaping.</p>
