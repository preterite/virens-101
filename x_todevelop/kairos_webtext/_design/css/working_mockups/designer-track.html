                    <h1>System Architecture</h1>
                    
                    <p class="lead">Course design requires understanding writing as system rather than product. VIRENS 101 structures constraints temporally—not as fixed requirements but as sequenced arrivals that enable accumulation. The designer's task: create conditions where student labor transforms into reusable capability.</p>

                    <p>Traditional course design treats assignments as discrete tasks. Students complete one, submit it, receive feedback, move to the next. Each assignment stands alone. This approach misses how professional writers actually work: by building systems for managing complexity over time.</p>

                    <div class="bold-box">
                        <h3>Design Principle</h3>
                        <p>Infrastructure emerges from constraint layering. Early constraints establish baseline protocols. Middle constraints build on established infrastructure. Late constraints enable synthesis impossible without prior accumulation.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h2>Movement One: Surfacing</h2>

                    <p>The opening weeks focus on making visible what students already do unconsciously. They take notes—but have they examined their note-taking system? They mark up texts—but can they articulate what marks mean? Surfacing converts tacit practice into explicit protocol.</p>

                    <h3>Technology Selection</h3>

                    <p>Index cards for capture. Folders for classification. These analog technologies force visibility. Students can see their entire note collection at once. They can physically sort and resort. Digital tools promise efficiency but hide process. Analog tools foreground it.</p>

                    <ul class="content-list">
                        <li>One constraint per week allows habituation before adding complexity</li>
                        <li>Physical constraints create visible accumulation students can assess</li>
                        <li>Low-tech tools prevent automation that obscures emerging patterns</li>
                        <li>Mandatory documentation creates archives for later analysis</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Observing Difficulty</h3>

                    <p>Week three introduces constraint audits: students document which requirements proved hardest to meet. This transforms difficulty from failure signal into diagnostic data. Where do constraints bind? That binding reveals system state.</p>

                    <div class="bold-box">
                        <h3>Failure as Feature</h3>
                        <p>Traditional pedagogy treats difficulty as problem requiring intervention. Systems pedagogy treats difficulty as information about current capability. When constraints bind, they reveal capacity limits. This makes difficulty useful rather than shameful.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h2>Movement Two: Naming</h2>

                    <p>Mid-semester work provides vocabulary for understanding writing operations. BEAM taxonomy names source functions. SEAR methodology names research moves. This vocabulary enables students to describe what they're doing while they're doing it—metacognitive awareness through naming.</p>

                    <p>Peer review becomes routing protocol rather than evaluation theater. Drafts circulate through structured feedback systems. Students learn their writing moves through social infrastructure. The emphasis shifts from "getting feedback" to "participating in circulation."</p>

                    <h2>Temporal Architecture</h2>

                    <p>The course unfolds across four movements, each building on prior infrastructure. This temporal sequencing distinguishes constraint structure from traditional assignment sequencing. It's not just what comes when—it's how later constraints leverage earlier capability.</p>

                    <p>By week eleven, students can perform operations impossible in week one. Not because they've learned more content, but because they've built infrastructure. Their past work becomes capital for present work. This accumulation is the economic function of constraint structure.</p>

                    <h2>Design Documentation</h2>

                    <p>This article itself demonstrates constraint structure: it accumulates theory through documentation fiction. The dual narrative tracks—student journey and designer reflection—show the same system from complementary perspectives. Readers can follow either track, or read both to understand the full architecture.</p>

                    <p>Making design visible matters. Too much composition scholarship obscures how courses actually work. By documenting decision points, this article enables replication and adaptation. Other instructors can understand not just what happened but why specific constraints arrived in specific sequence.</p>
