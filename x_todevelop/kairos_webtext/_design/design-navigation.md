# Navigation Design

## Primary Navigation Layers

1. **Track selector**: Vera / Grant / Nexus
2. **Within-track**: Scene/node list
3. **Cross-references**: Links within content

## Entry Points

- **index.md**: Landing page with track choice
- **nexus-hub.md**: Central nexus navigation (tree list)
- Individual scenes/nodes accessible directly

## Reading Paths

### Recommended Order

1. Start with track preference (Vera or Grant)
2. Read chronologically within track
3. Follow nexus links as encountered
4. Explore other track afterward

### Open Navigation

All pages accessible from any point; no gates or required sequence.

## QUANTITATION Puzzle

- Tree pages contain subtle clues to sequence
- Solving reveals: Q-U-A-N-T-I-T-A-T-I-O-N
- Easter egg acknowledgment on completion

## Open Questions

- Should readers toggle between Vera/Grant views of W9 conference?
- How do nexus pages handle readers arriving without scene context?
- Mobile puzzle experience?
