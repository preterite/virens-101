# Easter Egg Design

## QUANTITATION Puzzle

### Mechanism

- 12 tree pages contain clues to their position in sequence
- Reader pieces together: Q-U-A-N-T-I-T-A-T-I-O-N
- Successful sequence unlocks acknowledgment

### Implementation Options

1. **localStorage tracking**: Track visited pages, reveal when complete
2. **Hidden input field**: Reader types sequence
3. **Visual puzzle**: Arrange tree icons

### Clue Design

Each tree page contains subtle hint to its letter:
- Quercus (Q): "Questions begin here..."
- Ulmus (U): "Understanding Elbow anew..."
- etc.

## Guestbook

### Implementation Options

1. **GitHub Issues**: Structured, version-controlled
2. **Utterances**: GitHub Issues-backed comments
3. **Static form**: Collected separately

### Content

Readers can leave:
- Reading path taken
- Discoveries made
- Questions raised

## Acknowledgments Page

Special acknowledgments page accessible after puzzle completion:
- AI collaboration disclosure (Claude)
- Personal acknowledgments
- Development process notes
