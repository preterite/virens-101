# Fragment: 15-Week Structure Imposes Linearity

## Core

Despite rhetoric about "messiness" and "recursion," the semester's temporal structure produces linear syllabi in practice, and this linearity misrepresents how writing actually works.

## Elaboration

This assumption motivates the course's accumulation arc as intervention. The claim is empirical (98% of TA syllabi are linear) and theoretical (linear structure can't support compounding). The article could develop this by analyzing representative syllabi, showing the gap between expressed values (recursion) and operational structure (sequence of discrete assignments). The risk is overstating the case—some courses do build accumulation; the point is that the default structure works against it, requiring deliberate design to overcome. The institutional time-container shapes what's pedagogically possible.

## Resonances

- [[nexus-ulmus]] — cycles, the question of how time is structured
- [[nexus-nyssa]] — resistance to linearity, flow

## Open

- Need to analyze actual syllabi to support the 98% claim
- How to distinguish this critique from generic "be more recursive" advice?
- Connection to credit hour as institutional constraint?
