# Fragment: Past as Store, Not Formation

## Core

Genre theory treats the writer's past as *formation*—how institutions and discourse shaped current repertoires—while constraint structure treats the writer's past as *capital*—accumulated resources available for recirculation and compounding.

## Elaboration

This is the sharpest distinction from genre theory and answers the "just different terms" critique. Both accounts are true, but they ask different questions and produce different pedagogies. Genre theory asks: what recurring situation is this? (looking outward to social patterns). Constraint structure asks: what have I already made that I can build on? (looking backward to one's own textual history). The article could develop this by engaging directly with Bawarshi, Devitt, and the uptake literature, acknowledging their dynamism while showing what the economic frame adds. The key move: writing lets what you did *stay with you*, available for reconfiguration and reproduction, enabling compounding appropriation of value.

## Resonances

- [[nexus-olea]] — durability, preservation, value across time
- [[nexus-quercus]] — rootedness, foundation in prior work

## Open

- How to engage genre theory's uptake/repertoire literature without strawmanning?
- Is "capital" the right economic term, or does it carry unwanted connotations?
- Connection to Trimbur [[@trimbur2000compp]] on circulation?
