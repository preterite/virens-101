# Fragment: Mild Technological Determinism

## Core

The argument assumes that information environments shape human capacities and choices in durable ways—a position no stronger than Ong's [[@ong2012writi]] claims about writing's effects on consciousness.

## Elaboration

This assumption underwrites the "why now?" argument: if the information environment didn't shape us, there'd be no reason to redesign pedagogy for the New Dark Age. The "we engineered ourselves" move distributes agency across accumulated human choices, avoiding strong determinism while preserving the claim that environment matters. The article could address this directly by positioning the argument within the Ong/Havelock/McLuhan tradition while acknowledging its critiques. The alternative—treating environment as neutral backdrop—would gut the exigence. This is mild determinism, acceptable for the argument's purposes.

## Resonances

- [[nexus-quercus]] — environment as shaping force
- [[nexus-thuja]] — structuring effects of technologies

## Open

- How to acknowledge determinism critiques without abandoning the claim?
- Is Ong still a good touchstone, or is he dated for composition audiences?
- Connection to Kittler, media archaeology?
