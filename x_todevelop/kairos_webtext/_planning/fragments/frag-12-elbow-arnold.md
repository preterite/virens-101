# Fragment: Elbow + Arnold's Buried Life

## Core

Elbow's pedagogy and Arnold's poem both point toward inaccessible interiority—not essence to be expressed but void to be reached toward—and this connection recovers Elbow against social-turn critiques.

## Elaboration

The social turn read Elbow as naive expressivist believing in authentic selfhood available for transcription. But "The Buried Life" isn't about accessing essence; it's about the _inaccessibility_ of whatever's down there, glimpsed only in rare moments. If Elbow is read through Arnold, he's not claiming we can grasp authentic voice—he's claiming the reaching matters pedagogically. This makes Elbow's position deconstructively sophisticated rather than naive: you can't deconstruct an essence no one's claiming exists. The article could develop this by close reading Elbow's own hedges and qualifications, showing he was always more careful than his critics allowed.

## Resonances

- [[nexus-nerium]] — opacity, what can't be accessed
- [[nexus-acer]] — interiority, student selfhood

## Open

- Close reading needed: which Elbow texts show this sophistication?
- How to pitch the Arnold connection without seeming random?
- Does this recovery matter for the article's main argument?
