# Fragment: AI as Distribution Question

## Core

The question about AI in writing instruction isn't whether it's good or bad but who appropriates the labor-capital conversion it enables—students, instructors, administrators, or platforms?

## Elaboration

AI could mean students appropriate (easier revision, faster feedback, more iteration cycles). It could mean instructors appropriate (reduced grading labor, more time for higher-order response). It could mean administrators appropriate (fewer instructors needed, larger sections). It could mean platform owners appropriate (training data, subscription revenue). Thinking about AI through the labor-capital frame shifts the conversation from "is AI cheating?" to "who benefits from this technological intervention?" This positions the framework as timely without requiring the article to resolve the AI question. The gesture could go in the conclusion: here's what thinking economically about composition offers for current debates.

## Resonances

- [[nexus-olea]] — appropriation, who captures value
- [[nexus-thuja]] — technology, structured intervention

## Open

- How much AI content belongs in the article vs. gesture in conclusion?
- Is "distribution question" the right framing?
- Connection to Selber [[@selber2004multi]], Vie, other computers-and-writing scholars?
