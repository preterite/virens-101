# Fragment: Technology as Labor-Capital Conversion

## Core

Every instructional technology promises to convert labor into capital, to make future labor easier by investing present labor in a system. But the distribution question is always: *who appropriates that capital?*

## Elaboration

Moran's "drudgery" argument is essential here. AI in writing instruction could mean: students appropriate (easier revision, faster feedback, more iteration cycles), instructors appropriate (reduced grading labor, more time for higher-order response), administrators appropriate (fewer instructors needed, larger sections), or platform owners appropriate (training data, subscription revenue). The course design makes explicit choices about this distribution. The "drudgery" you want machines to handle is the low-invention work; the "drudgery" you want humans to keep is the actually-generative-but-undervalued labor of composing.

## Resonances

- [[nexus-ulmus]] — labor, the question of what work is valuable
- [[nexus-thuja]] — technology, structured intervention

## Open

- Need to locate and cite Moran's drudgery argument
- How to frame AI distribution question without being either utopian or dystopian?
- Connection to Selber on functional/critical/rhetorical literacies?
