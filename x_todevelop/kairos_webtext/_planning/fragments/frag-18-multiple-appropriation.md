# Fragment: Multiple Appropriation Moments

## Core

Gibson-Graham's [[@gibson-graham2006postc]] extension of Resnick [[@resnick1987knowl]]/Wolff gives theoretical apparatus to say: value isn't extracted once, by one party. In the writing course, multiple actors appropriate value at multiple moments.

## Elaboration

Students appropriate value when producing text (labor becomes artifact). Students appropriate again when circulating (peer response, portfolio). Students appropriate again in re-production (returning to fragments, reflecting). Instructors appropriate value (the course functions, grades become assignable, knowledge about student learning accumulates). The institution appropriates (credit hours, retention, assessment data). This isn't zero-sum. The course design argument is partly about *distributing* appropriation opportunities across parties and moments rather than concentrating them (say, in a single high-stakes final paper where the instructor is sole audience and assessor).

## Resonances

- [[nexus-olea]] — distribution, value across actors
- [[nexus-ilex]] — nodes of exchange, circulation points

## Open

- How to explain Gibson-Graham/Resnick-Wolff efficiently for composition audiences?
- Is "appropriation" the right term or does it carry negative connotations?
- Connection to Watkins on derivative value?
