# Fragment: Writing as Technology (Core Syllogism)

## Core

Writing is technology; technologies substitute capital for labor; substitution is economic activity; therefore composition is economic inquiry.

## Elaboration

This is the argumentative spine. But "writing is technology" is doing a lot of work. It's not just saying "we use tools to write." It's saying: writing *is* a tool, an externalization of cognitive process, a means of converting present labor into future capacity. Every text is capital—stored labor available for future use. This positions the article to say: composition pedagogy is always already economic pedagogy. The question isn't whether to think economically about writing instruction; the question is whether to do so explicitly, with attention to distribution, or implicitly, reproducing unexamined distributions.

## Resonances

- [[nexus-olea]] — economy, distribution, explicit economic thinking
- [[nexus-thuja]] — technology, writing as technological practice

## Open

- How to unpack "writing is technology" without endless digression?
- Connection to Ong [[@ong2012writi]], Havelock, Haas?
- Is the syllogism too neat—where are the complications?
