# Fragment: Neurodivergence + Context-Narrowing

## Core

Writing's requirement to establish its own context (after Plato's Phaedrus) makes explicit what face-to-face communication leaves implicit—which is helpful for minds that struggle with real-time social signal processing.

## Elaboration

This intersection grounds the embodied-agnostic subject in lived experience without claiming universality. For some minds, writing narrows the context window productively—fewer signals to parse, more time to process, explicit rather than implicit cues. The article could develop this carefully: not "writing is better for neurodivergent people" (too broad) but "writing's properties create conditions some minds find enabling." This connects to the Phaedrus critique of writing (it can't answer questions, it says the same thing to everyone) as, paradoxically, virtues for certain purposes. The course's emphasis on explicit constraint and textual accumulation amplifies these properties.

## Resonances

- [[nexus-ilex]] — particularity, specific conditions
- [[nexus-tsuga]] — persistence, durability of written forms

## Open

- How much autobiography belongs in the article?
- Is this a theoretical claim or just personal motivation?
- Connection to disability studies literature?
