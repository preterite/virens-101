# Fragment: Students Underestimate Intelligence

## Core

The students composition typically serves are smarter than they know, and a core pedagogical task is helping them discover capacities they don't yet recognize.

## Elaboration

This assumption shapes the course's orientation toward student agency and the "interest = attention + time" formulation. Students don't know what interests them because interest requires compound investment they haven't yet made. The article could develop this by connecting to threshold concepts literature (Meyer and Land) and troublesome knowledge—the idea that learning involves identity shifts, not just information acquisition. The assumption also connects to the agnostic subject: we can't know their interiorities, but we can create conditions where they surprise themselves through accumulated textual work. The course is designed to help students discover capacities, not to fix deficiencies.

## Resonances

- [[nexus-illicium]] — hidden capacity, what's not yet visible
- [[nexus-tsuga]] — growth over time, patience with development

## Open

- How to frame this without sounding condescending or deficit-focused?
- Connection to "interest = attention + time" as compounding?
- Threshold concepts literature as supporting frame?
