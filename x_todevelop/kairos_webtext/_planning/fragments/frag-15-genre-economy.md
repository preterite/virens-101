# Fragment: Genre Theory + Economy

## Core

Genre theory's "formation" (how discourse shaped you) and economy's "capital" (what you've accumulated as resource) offer complementary but distinct frames for the writer's relationship to their past.

## Elaboration

This intersection clarifies what the economy vocabulary adds. Both frames treat writers as historically constituted—no one starts from zero. But genre theory emphasizes _external_ patterns internalized (social action, recurring situations, uptake), while economy emphasizes _owned_ resources available for deployment (textual store, accumulated constraints, compoundable labor). The article could develop this as _both/and_ rather than either/or: students are shaped by genre patterns (true) and accumulate textual capital (also true). The pedagogical question is which frame produces more useful interventions for first-year writers. The argument: at that stage, helping students see what they _have_ matters more than helping them see what shaped them.

## Resonances

- [[nexus-olea]] — value, economy, distribution
- [[nexus-ulmus]] — labor, production

## Open

- How to frame as both/and rather than rejection of genre theory?
- What do first-year writers specifically need?
- Connection to transfer research (Yancey [[@yancey1998refle]], Nowacek)?
