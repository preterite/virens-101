# Fragment: Circulation as Primary Site

## Core

Trimbur's recovery of delivery/circulation as neglected canon connects to Horner's materialist emphasis: value isn't just produced, it *moves*. The "product" is partly the pattern of movement, not just the final artifact.

## Elaboration

The course builds a circulation system—fragments move through accumulation, through peer exchange, through reflection, through revision. This connects to Watkins on derivative value in English departments. Composition has often been positioned as deriving value from elsewhere (from literature's prestige, from the service function). This framework positions composition as *producing* value through organized circulation—not derivative but generative. The value of a fragment isn't fixed at production; it changes as the fragment moves through different contexts and uses.

## Resonances

- [[nexus-alnus]] — accumulation, what circulation enables
- [[nexus-nyssa]] — flow, movement, non-static value

## Open

- How to engage Trimbur without just citing him?
- Connection to Horner's materialist emphasis?
- Watkins on derivative value—need to locate and read closely
