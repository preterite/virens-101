# Fragment: Galloway + Constraint Structure

## Core

Galloway's [[@galloway2004proto]] concept of protocol—distributed control enabling coordination without centralization—describes how constraint sequences function in the course: enabling students to coordinate with their own pasts, futures, and information environments.

## Elaboration

This intersection legitimizes the development-vocabulary transfer by grounding it in media theory, not just practitioner intuition. Protocols don't determine outcomes but enable certain kinds of coordination while foreclosing others. The course's constraint sequences work similarly: they don't prescribe what students write but shape the _conditions_ of writing in ways that enable accumulation. The article could develop this by analyzing specific course protocols—how the week-over-week structure, the textual carryforward mechanisms, the feedback loops function as distributed control. The risk is over-abstracting; the opportunity is showing composition scholars a different theoretical vocabulary for what they're already doing when they design courses.

## Resonances

- [[nexus-taxus]] — sequencing, temporal ordering
- [[nexus-ilex]] — nodes, coordination points

## Open

- Which specific course mechanisms best illustrate protocol-thinking?
- How much Galloway can composition audiences handle?
- Connection to infrastructure studies (Star [[@star1999ethnp]], Bowker)?

# Fragment: Protocol and Pedagogy

## Core

If the course _is_ a protocol (distributed control enabling coordination without centralization), what does it enable coordination _between_, and what happens to the pedagogical relationship?

## Elaboration

Galloway's [[@galloway2004proto]] protocol concept fits the course's constraint structure—sequences that enable students to coordinate with past/future selves, information flows, institutional time. But "teacher as systems administrator" risks flattening pedagogy into infrastructure management. The article needs to address what's preserved of teaching as relational practice. One direction: the course is _protocological_ (teaching how to construct and shape protocols for writing tasks) rather than _being_ a protocol. Another: protocols enable but don't determine; the teacher's role is designing and adjusting protocols, which is a form of care.

## Resonances

- [[nexus-ilex]] — connections, coordination points
- [[nexus-alnus]] — accumulation as what protocols enable

## Open

- Is the course a protocol, or does it teach protocol-thinking?
- What's preserved of pedagogy as relational practice?
- How to engage Galloway without losing composition audiences?
