# Fragment: Galloway + Constraint Structure

## Core

Galloway's [[@galloway2004proto]] concept of protocol—distributed control enabling coordination without centralization—describes how constraint sequences function in the course: enabling students to coordinate with their own pasts, futures, and information environments.

## Elaboration

This intersection legitimizes the development-vocabulary transfer by grounding it in media theory, not just practitioner intuition. Protocols don't determine outcomes but enable certain kinds of coordination while foreclosing others. The course's constraint sequences work similarly: they don't prescribe what students write but shape the *conditions* of writing in ways that enable accumulation. The article could develop this by analyzing specific course protocols—how the week-over-week structure, the textual carryforward mechanisms, the feedback loops function as distributed control. The risk is over-abstracting; the opportunity is showing composition scholars a different theoretical vocabulary for what they're already doing when they design courses.

## Resonances

- [[nexus-taxus]] — sequencing, temporal ordering
- [[nexus-ilex]] — nodes, coordination points

## Open

- Which specific course mechanisms best illustrate protocol-thinking?
- How much Galloway can composition audiences handle?
- Connection to infrastructure studies (Star [[@star1999ethnp]], Bowker)?
