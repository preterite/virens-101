# Fragment: Labor-in-Cycles vs. Labor-as-Measure

## Core

Inoue's [[@inoue2019labos]] labor-based grading, despite invoking Marx, relies on Smithian direct equivalence (time = value), while a Marxian frame emphasizes value produced _in cycles_—where compounding means an hour in week 12 produces more than an hour in week 2.

## Elaboration

This is a potential contribution to the labor-in-composition conversation, not merely a parallel track. Inoue's framework can't account for accumulation effects because direct equivalence treats all hours as fungible. Marx's insight is that value happens in movement, in circulation, in the relationship between cycles of production and consumption. The article could develop this carefully—Marx carries baggage in composition, and you'd need to specify which Marx (the temporal, circulationist Marx of Volume 2, not the humanist early Marx or the structuralist Althusserian Marx). The composition field largely reads about Marx rather than reading Marx directly; this is symptomatic. The argument is a friendly complication of Inoue, extending labor-based pedagogy by addressing what direct equivalence misses.

## Resonances

- [[nexus-taxus]] — time, mortality, the value of temporal position
- [[nexus-olea]] — value production, economy, distribution

## Open

- Which Marx specifically? Volume 2 reproduction schemas seem most relevant.
- How to frame the Inoue complication as friendly extension rather than critique?
- Need to cite Catherine Chaput [[@chaput2010rheto]], Christian Pulver, others who engage Marx directly.
