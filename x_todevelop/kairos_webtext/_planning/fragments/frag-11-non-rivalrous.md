# Fragment: Non-Rivalrous Framing

## Core

Against Hyde's scarcity framing of gift economy, textual capital isn't depleted by sharing. When a student shares a draft, they don't lose it. This is closer to "gift that increases in giving" but without the sacrificial undertone.

## Elaboration

"The commons" tends to pull toward scarcity framing—the Hardin problem, the tragedy, the enclosure threat. Hyde's gift economy is partly a scarcity economy (the gift must be _given up_ to circulate; there's sacrifice). The non-rivalrous framing resists this: textual capital isn't depleted by sharing. When ideas circulate, they don't diminish. The experience-good framing is useful: you can't outsource reception. But textual artifacts are durable in ways experiences aren't. The text persists after the reading. This is partly what "capital" captures—stored labor available for future use. The text is experience-good _and_ durable artifact, which is why it can accumulate.

## Resonances

- [[nexus-ilex]] — circulation without depletion
- [[nexus-alnus]] — accumulation, what non-rivalry enables

## Open

- How to engage Hyde without strawmanning the gift economy framing?
- Is "non-rivalrous" too economics-jargon for composition audiences?
- Connection to open-source, Creative Commons models?
