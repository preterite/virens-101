# Fragment: Economy Inside vs. Outside Classroom

## Core

The move is ontological, not just analytical: the classroom *is* an economic site, not merely a site *affected by* economic forces. Production, circulation, appropriation happen *there*, in the acts of writing and response and revision.

## Elaboration

Scott's framing (and much of the political economy of composition conversation) treats the classroom as a site affected by economic forces—adjunctification, assessment regimes, institutional budgets, student debt. The critique is about what happens *to* writing instruction because of economic pressures. This argument says: the classroom *is* an economic site. A student drafting a paragraph is engaged in production. A peer response is a circulation event. Revision is re-production. These aren't metaphors for economic activity; they *are* economic activity, just non-market economic activity. This is why Gibson-Graham [[@gibson-graham2006postc]] matters more than Bourdieu. Bourdieu's "capital" is metaphorical—analogies between domains. Gibson-Graham refuse the metaphor: non-market production is still production.

## Resonances

- [[nexus-ulmus]] — production, labor in the classroom
- [[nexus-olea]] — economy as ontological frame, not just analytical lens

## Open

- How to distinguish from Scott and political-economy-of-comp conversation?
- Gibson-Graham vs. Bourdieu—how much to develop this distinction?
- Connection to Strickland's "managerial unconscious"?
