# Fragment: Writing Was Always More Like Development

## Core

The intellectual vocabulary of software development—templates, specs, dependencies, definitions, relations, flows—describes what writing has always been more accurately than composition's inherited romantic-individualist or social-constructionist frameworks.

## Elaboration

This is both homology (resemblances in shape illuminate gaps in practice) and revelation (writing *was* this but we lacked vocabulary). The autobiographical thread matters here: building personal academic productivity systems gave vocabulary (YAML, JSON arrays, structured data, iTerm2/Finder parallax) that *clicked* as ways of understanding writing. The article could develop this by tracing specific conceptual transfers: how "dependency" reframes citation, how "template" reframes genre, how "version control" reframes revision. The risk is appearing to import tech vocabulary uncritically; the opportunity is showing that development practices formalized something writing always did.

## Resonances

- [[nexus-acer]] — structured growth, developing forms
- [[nexus-tsuga]] — evergreen persistence of forms, durability

## Open

- Is this appropriation (borrowing terms), translation (finding equivalents), or recognition (discovering shared deep structure)?
- How to pitch this to composition scholars suspicious of tech-vocabulary importation?
- Which specific development concepts are most productive for transfer?
