# Fragment: New Dark Age as Exigence

## Core

The contemporary information environment is characterized not by simple overload but by *structured non-signal*—engineered opacity and feedback loops that compound constrained human choices into durable systems that don't serve us.

## Elaboration

James Bridle's framing shifts the "why now?" argument away from volume (Burton had information overload too) toward quality: uncertainty, ambiguity, and darkness define the information age. This isn't Shannon's noise increasing—it's the proliferation of organized distraction, information we can't access but that shapes our attention. The article could develop this by showing how composition pedagogy has responded inadequately to this shift, still treating information as something to be mastered (research skills) rather than managed (protocols, flows, systems). The course teaches students to see themselves as participants in these feedback loops, not victims—people who make choices that become structures. Mild determinism (no worse than Ong's) is acceptable here; "we engineered ourselves" distributes agency.

## Resonances

- [[nexus-nerium]] — darkness, toxicity, engineered opacity
- [[nexus-illicium]] — complexity, entanglement, hidden mechanisms

## Open

- How to frame the Bridle argument for composition scholars who may not know the book?
- Is "structured non-signal" the best term, or is there existing vocabulary in the field?
- Connection to Galloway's protocol concept?
