# Fragment: Process Pedagogy Distinction

## Core

Process pedagogy still aimed at the essay as telos, valuing process instrumentally. Constraint structure treats the essay as platform for further work—the operational difference is carry forward vs. restart with each assignment.

## Elaboration

The distinction is teleological: process pedagogy valued messy drafting because it produced better final texts. The essay remained the goal. Constraint structure says the essay is a node in a system of texts and practices, valuable not as product but as stage in accumulation. But this distinction can sound subtle or merely verbal to skeptical readers. The article needs concrete illustrations: how does the course *operationally* differ from a process-based course? One answer: process courses often restart with each assignment; accumulation courses carry forward. Another: process focuses on revision of single texts; accumulation focuses on relationships between texts over time.
