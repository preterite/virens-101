# Fragment: Bridle + Student Subjectivity

## Core

Bridle's New Dark Age (structured non-signal, engineered distraction) and the embodied-agnostic subject (specific humans in time with constrained attention) meet in the pedagogical goal of teaching students to see and shape the loops they're caught in.

## Elaboration

The course responds to an environment students didn't choose but participate in. The mild determinism is softened by agency: "we engineered ourselves through our choices" means students can learn to engineer differently. This frames the course not as defense against hostile environment but as training in *participation*—learning to see how one's choices become structures, how structures shape future choices, where intervention is possible. The article could develop this by showing how specific course activities make feedback loops visible: how the accumulation arc lets students see their own textual history as resource, how constraint-sequencing teaches them to design their own protocols.

## Open

- How to frame "participation" without sounding resigned to bad conditions?
- Which course activities best demonstrate loop-visibility?
- Connection to metacognition literature?
