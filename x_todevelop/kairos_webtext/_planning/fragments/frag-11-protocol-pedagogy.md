# Fragment: Protocol and Pedagogy

## Core

If the course *is* a protocol (distributed control enabling coordination without centralization), what does it enable coordination *between*, and what happens to the pedagogical relationship?

## Elaboration

Galloway's protocol concept fits the course's constraint structure—sequences that enable students to coordinate with past/future selves, information flows, institutional time. But "teacher as systems administrator" risks flattening pedagogy into infrastructure management. The article needs to address what's preserved of teaching as relational practice. One direction: the course is *protocological* (teaching how to construct and shape protocols for writing tasks) rather than *being* a protocol. Another: protocols enable but don't determine; the teacher's role is designing and adjusting protocols, which is a form of care.
