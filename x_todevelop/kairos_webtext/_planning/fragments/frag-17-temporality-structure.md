# Fragment: Temporality as Pedagogical Structure

## Core

Constraint sequencing is fundamentally temporal—*when* constraints arrive shapes what students can do with them. Order is constitutive, not just organizational.

## Elaboration

This isn't course design as calendar-filling; it's an argument that sequence produces different possibilities. Arendt's distinction between labor (cyclical, maintaining, consumed in the using) and work (producing durable objects that outlast their making) could sharpen this: composition instruction typically gets coded as "labor" (the grading wheel, the semester cycle), but properly sequenced constraint converts that into "work"—students produce textual capital that endures beyond the assignment moment. The Afghanistan time-block logistics make this concrete: physical constraints on *when* determine *what*. The course design externalizes this logic, makes it visible, and turns it to pedagogical purpose.

## Resonances

- [[nexus-ulmus]] — cycles, labor/work distinction
- [[nexus-thuja]] — structure, deliberate design

## Open

- How to develop the Arendt labor/work distinction for composition audiences?
- What's the Afghanistan reference? (Need to locate this in notes)
- Connection to Strickland on managerial time?
