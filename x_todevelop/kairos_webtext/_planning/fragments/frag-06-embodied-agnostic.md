# Fragment: Embodied Agnostic Subject

## Core

Against both romantic-individual ("express authentic self") and social-constructionist ("you are constituted by discourse") models, composition should assume an _embodied agnostic subject_: a specific human with specific capacities, whose interiority remains unknowable for pedagogical purposes beyond what writing communicates.

## Elaboration

This is theoretical personally but methodological for the article: for purposes of composition, we can access very little of others' interiorities and must work through writing. This actually _heightens_ Elbow rather than abandoning him—both point toward something inaccessible, but where Elbow posits a buried essence worth reaching for, this posits a void on the map. The Arnold connection ("The Buried Life") is productive: the reaching matters, not the grasping. The course design operationalizes agnosticism—constraints and textual accumulation work regardless of what's happening "inside" the student. Writing narrows context in ways helpful for minds that struggle with face-to-face signal overload.

## Resonances

- [[nexus-nerium]] — opacity, what can't be seen
- [[nexus-ilex]] — particularity, specific nodes

## Open

- Is "embodied agnostic" a theoretical claim about subjectivity or methodological bracket?
- How does agnosticism about interiority relate to the Elbow recovery?
- Does the neurodivergent framing belong in the article?
