# Fragment: Composition Doesn't Read Marx Directly

## Core

The field's engagement with Marx is largely secondhand, producing frameworks that invoke Marxian vocabulary without grappling with Marxian theory—including in labor-based pedagogy.

## Elaboration

This assumption positions the intervention as corrective: not "here's a new theory" but "here's what the theory we claim to use actually says." Early publication on this (reviewing a prominent scholar's edited collection that never cited Marx directly) provides standing, but the claim requires care—it's a critique of disciplinary practice, not just theoretical disagreement. The article could develop this by tracing citation chains in key labor-focused composition texts, showing where summaries substitute for sources. The risk is appearing merely polemical; the opportunity is showing how direct engagement with Marx (specifically the circulationist Marx of Volume 2) opens pedagogical possibilities the secondhand version forecloses.

## Resonances

- [[nexus-ulmus]] — labor theory, value production
- [[nexus-quercus]] — foundational theoretical commitments

## Open

- How to make this claim without alienating readers?
- Which texts to analyze for citation chains?
- Catherine Chaput [[@chaput2010rheto]], Christian Pulver as counter-examples of direct engagement?
