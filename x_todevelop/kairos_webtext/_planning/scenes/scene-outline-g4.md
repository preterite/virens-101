## Requirements Tracking

### MUST SHOW (non-negotiable)

- [ ] **Narrative**: Grant entering Vera's office, nervous
- [ ] **Six Move**: Connect (receiving connection help)
- [ ] **Concept**: Productive confusion → clarity
- [ ] **Character**: Seeing own work on screen differently
- [ ] **Character**: Specific advice that clicks
- [ ] **CRITICAL NEW REQUIREMENT (2026-02-11)**: Vera explains distinction between countable-for-practitioner vs countable-for-institution. Addresses Grant's skepticism from G3. Makes historical case (Smith-Babbage-Beecher-Bain trajectory). BUT Grant should remain only partially convinced—skepticism continues. See [[monograph-pedagogy-tension-synthesis]] and [[character-grant-miles]] skepticism arc.

### SHOULD PLANT (important for payoff)

- [ ] **Theme**: Individual within system
- [ ] **Theme**: Direction that addresses root cause
- [ ] **Setup**: What Grant will act on in G5

### COULD INCLUDE (enrichment, not essential)

- [ ] **Detail**: Same screen, different perspective than V4
- [ ] **Echo**: Student nervousness → relief arc
