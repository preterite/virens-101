# G3: "What You're Automating"

**Week**: 8  
**Movement**: M3 (Scale)  
**Focus**: Infrastructure visibility; automation recognition

## Conceptual Work

- "What you're automating is yourself"
- Infrastructure becomes visible through use
- Distill as move (extracting pattern from accumulation)
- Labor/capital substitution recognition

## Key Moments/Images

- Grant realizing his folder system works
- Recognizing patterns in his own fragments
- Library parallel: automation of routing
- "Oh, this is what the system does"

## Setting Details

- Study space or library
- Looking back at accumulated corpus
- Mid-semester organizational moment

## Connects To

- **V3** (Week 7): Vera reading audits
- **G4** (Week 9): Conference builds on recognition
- **Tsuga** (Infrastructure): Star's [[@star1999ethnp]] visibility principle
- **Quercus** (Labor/Capital): Economic frame

## Requirements Tracking

### MUST SHOW (non-negotiable)

- [ ] **Narrative**: Grant realizing his folder system works
- [ ] **Six Move**: Distill (extracting pattern from accumulation)
- [ ] **Concept**: "What you're automating is yourself"
- [ ] **Concept**: Infrastructure visibility through use
- [ ] **CRITICAL NEW REQUIREMENT (2026-02-11)**: Grant notices similarity between six-moves framework and institutional assessment systems (counting fragments like institution counts students/instructors). Feels uneasy about parallel. Initial skepticism about decomposition methodology. See [[monograph-pedagogy-tension-synthesis]] and [[character-grant-miles]] skepticism arc.
- [ ] **NEW REQUIREMENT (2026-02-12)**: Introduce quantitation-as-concept on the student side. Week 8's "What You're Automating" is the natural site for the question: "what happens to your writing when it becomes countable? who benefits from that countability?" This connects Grant's automation recognition to the webtext's driving question. The scene should show Grant encountering countability not just as convenience (my folder system works) but as a question (what does counting my fragments *do*, and for whom?). See [[quantitation-course-sequence-mapping]] OQ3.

### SHOULD PLANT (important for payoff)

- [ ] **Theme**: Labor/capital substitution recognition
- [ ] **Theme**: Library parallel: automation of routing
- [ ] **Setup**: What Grant brings to G4 conference
- [ ] **Fragment**: [[frag-04-essay-as-node]]
- [ ] **Fragment**: [[frag-03-past-as-store]]

### COULD INCLUDE (enrichment, not essential)

- [ ] **Detail**: Looking back at accumulated corpus
- [ ] **Echo**: "Oh, this is what the system does"

### CURRENTLY SHOWS (draft tracking)

*Update as you draft:*
