## Requirements Tracking

### MUST SHOW (non-negotiable)

- [ ] **Narrative**: Grant organizing BEAM Portfolio
- [ ] **Six Move**: Distill (portfolio-scale consolidation)
- [ ] **Concept**: Corpse → Compost transformation visible
- [ ] **Character**: Seeing connections between fragments
- [ ] **CRITICAL NEW REQUIREMENT (2026-02-11)**: Grant's skepticism surfaces again during assessment/consolidation work. Questions like "couldn't institution just count my fragments too?" or "what stops this from becoming another rubric?" Productive doubt continues. See [[monograph-pedagogy-tension-synthesis]] and [[character-grant-miles]] skepticism arc.

### SHOULD PLANT (important for payoff)

- [ ] **Theme**: Dev log as analyzable corpus
- [ ] **Theme**: Dead fragments becoming useful
- [ ] **Theme**: Planning documented inquiry
- [ ] **Fragment**: [[600_teaching/virens_101/x_todevelop/kairos_webtext/_planning/fragments/frag-08-process-distinction]]

### COULD INCLUDE (enrichment, not essential)

- [ ] **Detail**: Fragments spread out (physical or digital)
- [ ] **Echo**: Selection and arrangement work

### CURRENTLY SHOWS (draft tracking)
