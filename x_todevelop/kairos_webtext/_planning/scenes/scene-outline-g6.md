## Requirements Tracking

### MUST SHOW (non-negotiable)

- [ ] **Narrative**: Opening sealed envelope from Week 1
- [ ] **Six Move**: Publish (making work public)
- [ ] **Concept**: Accumulation's arc visible
- [ ] **Concept**: Garden: cultivated selection from accumulated material
- [ ] **Character**: Recognition of distance traveled
- [ ] **CRITICAL NEW REQUIREMENT (2026-02-11)**: Grant's skepticism persists in final reflection. Questions about institutional appropriation remain unresolved. "How do I know when I'm managing operations vs. being managed by them?" No false closure—denaturalization as ongoing practice. See [[monograph-pedagogy-tension-synthesis]] and [[character-grant-miles]] skepticism arc.

### SHOULD PLANT (important for payoff)
