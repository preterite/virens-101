# V1: Envelope Planning

**Week**: 1  
**Movement**: M1 (Surfacing)  
**Focus**: Temporal design philosophy; semester as constraint arc

## Conceptual Work

- Introduces the envelope metaphor (sealed predictions, opened at end)
- Establishes constraint sequencing as deliberate design choice
- Shows designer thinking in systems terms
- "YOLO up, constrain down" as pedagogical principle

## Key Moments/Images

- Vera addressing sealed envelopes, writing predictions
- Walking commute, thinking through semester timeline
- Mental model of constraint arrival timing
- Metaphor: "dose and timing" of constraints as medicine/poison

## Setting Details

- Vera's office or home workspace
- Beginning of semester energy
- Course materials being finalized

## Connects To

- **G1** (Week 2): Grant's first encounter with the tech setup
- **Taxus** (Constraint Sequencing): Primary theoretical nexus
- **Alnus** (YOLO Up): Generate-first philosophy
- **Quercus** (Labor/Capital): Economy framing
