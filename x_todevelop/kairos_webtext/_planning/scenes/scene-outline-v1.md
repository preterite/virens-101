# V1: Envelope Planning

**Week**: 1  
**Movement**: M1 (Surfacing)  
**Focus**: Temporal design philosophy; semester as constraint arc

## Conceptual Work

- Introduces the envelope metaphor (sealed predictions, opened at end)
- Establishes constraint sequencing as deliberate design choice
- Shows designer thinking in systems terms
- "YOLO up, constrain down" as pedagogical principle

## Key Moments/Images

- Vera addressing sealed envelopes, writing predictions
- Walking commute, thinking through semester timeline
- Mental model of constraint arrival timing
- Metaphor: "dose and timing" of constraints as medicine/poison

## Setting Details

- Vera's office or home workspace
- Beginning of semester energy
- Course materials being finalized

## Connects To

- **G1** (Week 2): Grant's first encounter with the tech setup
- **Taxus** (Constraint Sequencing): Primary theoretical nexus
- **Alnus** (YOLO Up): Generate-first philosophy
- **Quercus** (Labor/Capital): Economy framing

## Requirements Tracking

### MUST SHOW (non-negotiable)

- [ ] **Narrative**: Vera preparing sealed envelopes with predictions
- [ ] **Six Move**: Capture (envelope as captured prediction)
- [ ] **Concept**: Constraint sequencing as deliberate design
- [ ] **Concept**: "YOLO up, constrain down" philosophy
- [ ] **Setup**: Envelope predictions that G6 will open

### SHOULD PLANT (important for payoff)

- [ ] **Theme**: Temporality—when constraints arrive matters
- [ ] **Theme**: Writing as labor/capital (economy framing)
- [ ] **Voice**: Designer thinking in systems terms
- [ ] **Fragment**: [[frag-17-temporality-structure]]
- [ ] **Fragment**: [[frag-21-writing-technology-syllogism]]

### COULD INCLUDE (enrichment, not essential)

- [ ] **Detail**: Vera's walking commute, cats, music tastes
- [ ] **Echo**: Dose/timing metaphor (medicine/poison)
- [ ] **Nexus-cloud**: [[frag-07-mild-determinism]]
