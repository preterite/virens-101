# Scene-to-Week Alignment Audit

> [!info] Audit Purpose
> Compare the Kairos webtext's 12 narrated scenes against the VIRENS 101 course design (consolidated schedule + weekly overviews) to identify discrepancies in timing, assignment placement, concept introduction, and narrative premises. The webtext is authoritative for theoretical framing; the course design must be updated where conflicts exist.

> [!warning] Direction of Authority
> When conflicts exist, the webtext's refined theoretical perspective is generally authoritative, and the course design should be updated to match — unless the course design reflects a practical constraint (time, block count, institutional requirement) that the webtext should instead accommodate.

## Legend

- ✅ **Aligned** — Scene premise matches course design
- ⚠️ **Tension** — Partial alignment; needs attention but not broken
- ❌ **Discrepancy** — Scene premise contradicts course design; resolution needed
- 🔵 **Backflow** — Webtext introduces something the course design doesn't yet contain

---

## V1: Envelope Planning (Week 1, M1)

**Scene premise**: Vera prepares sealed envelopes with predictions. Introduces constraint sequencing as deliberate design, "YOLO up, constrain down" philosophy, economy framing.

**Course design, Week 1**: "Beginning by Writing." Envelope exercise at Blocks 2-3. Five writing blocks + 1 administrative. Kirschenbaum reading. Fragment capture begins Block 4. Prompts 1.2 and 1.4 available.

| Element | Scene | Course | Status |
|---------|-------|--------|--------|
| Week placement | 1 | 1 | ✅ |
| Movement | M1 | M1 | ✅ |
| Envelope exercise | Central activity | Blocks 2-3, sealed and stored | ✅ |
| Six Move: Capture | "Envelope as captured prediction" | Block 4 introduces capture; envelope framed as "first fragment" | ✅ |
| Constraint sequencing | Named as deliberate design | "YOLO up, constrain down" named in synthesis; syllabus-as-specification framing | ✅ |
| Economy framing | Writing as labor/capital | Synthesis mentions "writing is a practice of accumulation" and "intellectual capital" but does NOT name this as economic in character | ⚠️ |
| Historical awareness (Babbage/Beecher/Bain) | CRITICAL NEW REQUIREMENT per monograph-pedagogy tension synthesis | Not present in any student-facing material | 🔵 **Backflow needed** |

**Notes**: The economy framing gap is significant. Week 1 synthesis uses the language of "accumulation" and "capital" but treats them as descriptive rather than as explicitly economic operations being named as such. The `env.md` draft says "the course names its operations as economic in character" — this should be visible to students by Week 1. The historical awareness requirement (V1 "must show" per 2026-02-11 update) has no corresponding student-facing content anywhere in the course design.

**Resolution needed**: Course overview and/or Week 1 synthesis needs denaturalization framing. See Q6 analysis for candidate locations.

---

## G1: Tech Setup (Week 2, M1)

**Scene premise**: Grant setting up folders, index cards, Eli Review. First encounter with capture infrastructure. Confusion about why all this infrastructure. Library job as organizational irony.

**Course design, Week 2**: "Building Your System." T1 (index cards + OneDrive) at Block 2, T2 (Eli Review intro) at Block 3. Ong reading. Freewriting practice. Graph thinking ONESIE.

| Element | Scene | Course | Status |
|---------|-------|--------|--------|
| Week placement | 2 | 2 | ✅ |
| Movement | M1 | M1 | ✅ |
| Tech setup activities | Folders, index cards, Eli Review | T1: cards + OneDrive (Block 2), T2: Eli Review (Block 3) | ✅ |
| Six Move: Capture | First encounter with capture infrastructure | Capture deepened; "future self as audience" | ✅ |
| "YOLO up" invitation | Generate freely | YOLO up, constrain down named in synthesis | ✅ |
| Confusion about infrastructure | Why all this setup? | Not explicitly staged as student confusion | ⚠️ |
| Library job setting | Grant at library circulation desk | N/A — character detail, not course content | ✅ (fiction) |

**Notes**: Strong alignment. The only tension is that the scene frames infrastructure confusion as a narrative beat (Grant doesn't understand why he needs all this), while the course design's Week 2 synthesis works to *preempt* that confusion (explaining the purpose of each tool, framing setup as investment in future self). This is appropriate — the course tries to answer the question Grant embodies. No action needed.

---

## V2: BEAM Classification (Weeks 6-7, M2) — RESOLVED

**Scene premise**: Vera observing students during BEAM activity. Classify as intellectual work. Students struggling to categorize sources. Zotero open. ONESIEs systematic vocabulary introduction.

**Course design, Weeks 6-7**:
- **Week 6**: "Classification and the Wunderkammer." Borges/Quine/Jackson readings. BEAM introduced in synthesis as response to classification problem. Spec Document due. Eli Review Cycle 2.
- **Week 7**: "When Form Fits." Alexander reading (Difficulty Pair B completes). BEAM operationalized at Block 6. Constraint Audit drafted and peer reviewed.

| Element | Scene | Course | Status |
|---------|-------|--------|--------|
| Week placement | 6-7 | 6-7 | ✅ |
| Movement | M2 | M2 | ✅ |
| BEAM as activity | Central — students categorize sources | Week 6 synthesis introduces BEAM; Week 7 Block 6 operationalizes | ✅ |
| Zotero open | Setting detail | Zotero introduced Week 5 (T3-T4); in use by Week 6 | ✅ |
| ONESIEs vocabulary | Mentioned as systematic introduction | BEAM is the ONESIE vocabulary for classification | ✅ |
| Six Move: Classify | Primary move | Classify foregrounded Weeks 6-7 | ✅ |
| Students struggling to categorize | Key narrative moment | Follows Borges/Quine (why classification is hard), precedes Alexander (how to assess fit) | ✅ |

**Notes**: RESOLVED 2026-02-12. V2 moved from Weeks 4-5 to Weeks 6-7 to match course design. This preserves the constraint sequence: SEAR (Week 4, sentence-level source integration) → Zotero (Week 5, tool-level source management) → Borges/Quine/Jackson (Week 6, classification as intellectual problem) → BEAM (Weeks 6-7, classification as practical framework). Students encounter the theoretical problem of classification before receiving a tool for managing it. Scene benefits from Borges/Quine context: students' struggles are richer when they've just encountered the Library of Babel.

---

## G2: Peer Review with BEAM (Weeks 7-8, M2→M3) — RESOLVED

**Scene premise**: Eli Review peer feedback session. Route as move. BEAM classification in peer feedback context. Library job parallel: "I do this all day."

**Course design, Weeks 7-8**:
- **Week 7**: Eli Review Cycle 3 on **Constraint Audit** (Evaluative/DES). BEAM operationalized at Block 6. Alexander reading.
- **Week 8**: Eli Review Cycle 4 on **BEAM Source Entries** (Evaluative/DES). Brooks reading. T5 "What You're Automating."

| Element | Scene | Course | Status |
|---------|-------|--------|--------|
| Week placement | 7-8 | 7-8 | ✅ |
| Movement | M2→M3 transition | M2 (Wk 7) → M3 (Wk 8) | ✅ |
| Eli Review peer feedback | Central activity | Cycle 3 (Wk 7) + Cycle 4 (Wk 8) | ✅ |
| Six Move: Route | Sending work to others | Peer review = routing to readers | ✅ |
| BEAM in peer context | Scene title includes BEAM | Week 7: BEAM just operationalized; Week 8: BEAM Source Entries peer reviewed | ✅ |
| Library parallel | "I do this all day" | N/A — character detail | ✅ (fiction) |

**Notes**: RESOLVED 2026-02-12. G2 moved from Weeks 5-6 to Weeks 7-8. Now Grant's peer review experience occurs after BEAM has been introduced (Week 6 synthesis) and operationalized (Week 7 Block 6), so BEAM thinking is genuinely present in the peer feedback context. The movement boundary crossing (M2 → M3) is actually a narrative advantage: Grant is doing peer review on BEAM-classified work right as the course transitions from Naming to Operating at Scale. His library parallel ("I do this all day") lands with more force because he's classifying and routing at the same time — the exact combination his library job requires.

---

## V3: Reading Constraint Audits (Week 7, M2)

**Scene premise**: Vera reading student Constraint Audits at home. Failure as diagnostic signal. Alexander's "fit" vocabulary. Grant's audit reveals something specific. Adjusting plans based on evidence.

**Course design, Week 7**: "When Form Fits." Alexander reading (Difficulty Pair B completes). Constraint Audit drafting (Block 1), Eli Review Cycle 3 on Constraint Audit (Block 3), source genealogy (Block 5), BEAM categorization (Block 6).

| Element | Scene | Course | Status |
|---------|-------|--------|--------|
| Week placement | 7 | 7 | ✅ |
| Movement | M2 | M2 | ✅ |
| Constraint Audit as activity | Central — Vera reads student audits | Audit drafted Block 1, peer reviewed Block 3 | ✅ |
| Alexander's "fit" vocabulary | Primary theoretical connection | Alexander reading this week; synthesis develops misfit-as-diagnostic extensively | ✅ |
| Failure as diagnostic | Key concept | Synthesis connects Alexander's misfit to Salvatori's difficulty | ✅ |
| Grant's audit reveals something | Narrative beat | N/A — instructor-facing observation | ✅ (fiction) |
| Difficulty Pair B completes | Not explicitly in scene | Meadows (Wk 5) → Alexander (Wk 7) | ✅ |

**Notes**: Strong alignment. V3 is one of the best-matched scenes. The only note is that the scene shows Vera reading audits *after* they're submitted (evening grading session), while the course design has Cycle 3 peer review happening during class (Block 3) and instructor feedback not explicitly scheduled for this week (it comes at Week 6 Block 6 for Spec Documents, but not for Constraint Audits). Vera's reading of audits would happen informally between weeks, which is realistic but not reflected in the schedule. No action needed.

---

## G3: "What You're Automating" (Week 8, M3)

**Scene premise**: Grant realizes his folder system works. Infrastructure becomes visible through use. "What you're automating is yourself." Labor/capital substitution recognition. NEW REQUIREMENT: Grant notices similarity between six-moves and institutional assessment; feels uneasy.

**Course design, Week 8**: "Werewolves and Gardens." T5: "What You're Automating" at Block 1. Brooks reading. Corpus inventory (Block 2). BEAM Portfolio entry drafting. Eli Review Cycle 4. Babbage mill/store distinction introduced.

| Element | Scene | Course | Status |
|---------|-------|--------|--------|
| Week placement | 8 | 8 | ✅ |
| Movement | M3 | M3 | ✅ |
| "What You're Automating" | Central concept | T5 session at Block 1 | ✅ |
| Infrastructure visibility | Key concept | Synthesis develops this through Brooks | ✅ |
| Six Move: Distill | Extracting pattern from accumulation | Week 8 doesn't foreground distill; synthesis focuses on essential/accidental complexity | ⚠️ |
| Folder system recognition | Grant realizes system works | Corpus inventory at Block 2 | ✅ |
| Labor/capital substitution | Recognized | Synthesis: "writing substitutes capital for labor" (echo from Week 2) | ✅ |
| Babbage mill/store | In course but not scene | Week 5 synthesis previews mill/store; Week 8 synthesis develops it | ⚠️ |
| Grant's skepticism about six-moves ≈ institutional assessment | CRITICAL NEW REQUIREMENT | Not in any student-facing material | 🔵 **Backflow** |

**Notes**: Good structural alignment. The "distill" move assignment is a minor tension — the coverage matrix assigns Distill to G3, but the Week 8 synthesis foregrounds Brooks's essential/accidental complexity rather than explicitly naming "distill." The distillation is *happening* (corpus inventory = looking at accumulated material for patterns) but isn't *named* as such. This could be addressed by adding "distill" vocabulary to the Week 8 corpus inventory activity description.

The skepticism requirement is pure backflow — Grant's character arc now includes questioning whether the six-moves framework resembles institutional assessment. This is a narratological requirement for the webtext, not necessarily something that needs to appear in student-facing materials (real students aren't Grant). However, if the course design claims to practice denaturalization, providing students space to question the framework's operations would be consistent.

---

## V4: Conference with Grant (Week 9, M3)

**Scene premise**: One-on-one office conference. Vera reviews Grant's corpus on screen. Specific diagnosis of Grant's patterns. Intervention within system. NEW REQUIREMENT: Vera explains countable-for-practitioner vs countable-for-institution distinction.

**Course design, Week 9**: Conference week. Individual 30-minute meetings. Student brings conference prep fragment + questions. Instructor provides email summary + direction.

| Element | Scene | Course | Status |
|---------|-------|--------|--------|
| Week placement | 9 | 9 | ✅ |
| Movement | M3 per coverage matrix | Week 9 overview says "Threshold (M2→M3)" | ⚠️ **Movement labeling inconsistency** |
| Conference format | 30-min individual meeting | 30-min conferences, 25 discussion + 5 break | ✅ |
| Reviewing corpus on screen | Vera sees Grant's work | "Gradebook review" + "your questions, your directions, your work" | ✅ |
| Specific diagnosis | Key narrative beat | Conference structure allows this | ✅ (fiction) |
| Six Move: Connect | Conference as connection point | Not explicitly named but conceptually present | ⚠️ |
| Countable-for-practitioner distinction | CRITICAL NEW REQUIREMENT | Not in conference structure or any course material | 🔵 **Backflow** |

**Notes**: The movement labeling is a real discrepancy. The consolidated schedule places M3 at Weeks 8-11, making Week 9 squarely in M3. But the Week 9 overview YAML says `movement: Threshold (M2→M3)`. The webtext's coverage matrix places V4 in M3. The weekly overview needs to be updated to align with the schedule.

The countable-for-practitioner vs countable-for-institution distinction is another backflow item. It's a narratological requirement for V4/G4's scene arc, not necessarily something the conference structure needs to contain. But if Vera is explaining this to Grant, it implies the course design has created conditions where such a conversation would arise — which means the six-moves framework's economic character should already be visible to students before Week 9.

---

## G4: Conference with Vera (Week 9, M3)

**Scene premise**: Same conference from Grant's POV. Productive confusion → clarity. Specific advice that clicks. Enters nervous, leaves with direction. NEW REQUIREMENT: Vera explains historical case; Grant remains only partially convinced.

**Course design, Week 9**: Same conference week structure.

| Element | Scene | Course | Status |
|---------|-------|--------|--------|
| Week placement | 9 | 9 | ✅ |
| All conference elements | Dual perspective on same meeting | Conference structure supports both views | ✅ |
| Historical case (Smith-Babbage-Beecher-Bain) | NEW REQUIREMENT in conference dialogue | Not present in course design | 🔵 **Backflow** |
| Grant's partial conviction | Skepticism continues post-conference | N/A — character arc | ✅ (fiction) |

**Notes**: G4's alignment depends on V4's. The conference week structure works for both perspectives. The historical case is a narrative device — Vera explaining to Grant — not something that needs to appear in the student-facing conference prep materials. However, for verisimilitude, the course should have introduced enough economic framing earlier that such a conversation wouldn't feel imported from nowhere.

---

## V5: Eli Review Analytics (Week 10, M3)

**Scene premise**: Vera reviewing Eli Review analytics dashboard. "Archives give you analytics." Quantitation as rhetoric. Star connection to Salvatori. Numbers as intervention points.

**Course design, Week 10**: "Infrastructure and Trails." Star + Bush readings (Difficulty Pair A completes). BEAM Portfolio entry drafting. Eli Review Cycle 5 (BEAM Portfolio Framing). Content mapping exercise. Folder check touch.

| Element | Scene | Course | Status |
|---------|-------|--------|--------|
| Week placement | 10 | 10 | ✅ |
| Movement | M3 | M3 | ✅ |
| Eli Review analytics | Central activity — Vera reviews dashboard | Not in student-facing activities; analytics are instructor-side | ✅ (designer perspective) |
| "Archives give you analytics" | Key concept | Not named in Week 10 materials | ⚠️ |
| Star reading | Present | Star is this week's reading | ✅ |
| Star-Salvatori connection | Explicit | Week 10 synthesis opens: "Seven weeks ago, you read Salvatori on difficulty" | ✅ |
| Quantitation as rhetoric | Nexus concept (Illicium) | Not in student-facing materials | 🔵 |
| Six Move: Connect | Coverage matrix assigns Connect here | Content mapping exercise is connection work | ✅ |

**Notes**: V5 is a designer-perspective scene showing what the instructor does with data that students generate. The student-facing course design doesn't need to contain "archives give you analytics" explicitly — this is Vera's insight, not Grant's assignment. The alignment is solid. The "quantitation as rhetoric" concept lives in the nexus (Illicium) and doesn't need course-design representation. Minor note: the scene's focus on analytics as intervention tool aligns with the Week 10 synthesis's emphasis on infrastructure visibility, even though the specific activity (reviewing Eli analytics) is instructor-only.

---

## G5: M3 Milestone / BEAM Portfolio (Week 11, M3)

**Scene premise**: Grant organizing BEAM Portfolio. Seeing connections between fragments. Dead fragments becoming useful. Corpse→Compost transformation visible. NEW REQUIREMENT: Grant's skepticism surfaces again during assessment work.

**Course design, Week 11**: "The Labor of Care." Ribes & Jackson reading. BEAM Portfolio completion. Distill as fifth move foregrounded. Instructor feedback on BEAM Portfolios (Block 4). Documented Inquiry planning begins.

| Element | Scene | Course | Status |
|---------|-------|--------|--------|
| Week placement | 11 | 11 | ✅ |
| Movement | M3 | M3 | ✅ |
| BEAM Portfolio completion | Central activity | Due end of week | ✅ |
| Seeing connections | Key moment | Content mapping from Week 10 feeds this | ✅ |
| Corpse→Compost | Transformation visible | Week 11 synthesis: "compost taking shape, sources digested and analyzed" | ✅ |
| Six Move: Distill | Coverage matrix assigns Distill also here | Synthesis: "This week foregrounds the fifth move: distill" | ✅ |
| Ribes & Jackson | In course but not scene | "The Labor of Care" — reading about maintenance labor | ⚠️ |
| Grant's assessment skepticism | NEW REQUIREMENT | Not in student-facing materials | 🔵 **Backflow** |

**Notes**: Strong alignment. The scene and course design agree on what happens and when. The Ribes & Jackson reading provides vocabulary for the labor G5 depicts (maintaining the portfolio's "delicate creatures") but isn't explicitly referenced in the scene outline — worth noting in scene drafting. The skepticism requirement is character-arc material.

---

## V6: Permission Flags (Week 13, M4)

**Scene premise**: Classroom conversation about what students now own. Permission Flags (VRWO). Progressive ownership transfer. Publish as sixth move. Designer releasing control.

**Course design, Week 13**: "Vivification." Bernstein reading. Process Archaeology due. T6 optional tools demo. Permission flags given "full treatment." Instructor feedback on portfolio drafts. Burke's "unending conversation." Six-move vocabulary culminates in "publish."

| Element | Scene | Course | Status |
|---------|-------|--------|--------|
| Week placement | 13 | 13 | ✅ |
| Movement | M4 | M4 | ✅ |
| Permission Flags | Central concept | Week 13 synthesis: full treatment of Unix permission flags mapped to writing | ✅ |
| Publish as sixth move | Culminating move | Synthesis: "publish feeds back into capture" (cyclical, not terminal) | ✅ |
| Ownership transfer | Key theme | Synthesis traces permission expansion across semester | ✅ |
| Bernstein reading | In course but not scene | "Blood on the Cutting Room Floor" — psychic surgery, vivification | ⚠️ |
| T6 optional tools | Setting detail potential | Block 3: advanced tools demo | ✅ |

**Notes**: Excellent alignment. V6 and Week 13 are tightly coupled. The Bernstein reading provides the intellectual context for V6's permission flags conversation, even though the scene outline doesn't foreground Bernstein. The scene should probably reference or echo Bernstein's vivification language, since the course design's synthesis makes it central.

---

## G6: Envelope Opening (Week 15, M4)

**Scene premise**: Opening sealed envelope from Week 1. Predictions vs. reality. Full transformation arc visible. Garden stage realized. Publish as move. NEW REQUIREMENT: Grant's skepticism persists; questions about institutional appropriation unresolved; no false closure.

**Course design, Week 15**: "What You've Built." Envelope return exercise. Parallel questions. Reflective cover letter. Transfer Proposal. Final Portfolio due. YOLO up, constrain down at semester scale.

| Element | Scene | Course | Status |
|---------|-------|--------|--------|
| Week placement | 15 | 15 | ✅ |
| Movement | M4 | M4 | ✅ |
| Envelope opening | Central activity | Blocks 1-2: write Week 15 responses, then receive envelopes | ✅ |
| Predictions vs. reality | Key moment | Four parallel question pairs with explicit "gap reveals" table | ✅ |
| Six Move: Publish | Making work public | Portfolio submission as publication | ✅ |
| Transformation arc | Full arc visible | Synthesis: envelope demonstrates YOLO up, constrain down at semester scale | ✅ |
| Transfer Proposal | Present | Block 3: Transfer Proposal | ✅ |
| Garden metaphor | Course-to-garden culmination | Not explicit in Week 15 synthesis (permission flags frame used instead) | ⚠️ |
| Grant's unresolved skepticism | NEW REQUIREMENT — no false closure | Not in student-facing materials | 🔵 **Backflow (fiction)** |

**Notes**: Strong alignment. The envelope exercise is the most tightly locked element across both projects — it was designed as a structural bookend from the beginning. The minor tension is that Week 15's synthesis frames the semester through permission flags rather than the corpse→compost→garden arc that G6 invokes. Both framings are present in the course design (garden language appears in Weeks 8 and 11), so this is a matter of emphasis in the scene, not a contradiction.

## Summary of Findings

### Discrepancies Requiring Resolution

| ID | Scene | Issue | Severity | Recommended Fix |
|----|-------|-------|----------|-----------------|
| D1 | V2 | BEAM classification placed at Weeks 4-5; course introduces BEAM at Weeks 6-7 | ❌ High | Move BEAM introduction to Week 5 (with Zotero) or move V2 to Weeks 6-7 |
| D2 | G2 | "Peer Review with BEAM" at Weeks 5-6; BEAM peer review occurs Week 8 | ❌ High | Dependent on D1 resolution; retitle or reframe G2 |
| D3 | V4/Wk9 | Movement label: schedule says M3; weekly overview says "Threshold M2→M3" | ⚠️ Medium | Update Week 9 overview YAML to `movement: M3` |

### Backflow Items (Webtext → Course Design)

| ID | Source | Requirement | Course Impact |
|----|--------|-------------|---------------|
| B1 | V1 + env.md | Historical awareness (Smith-Babbage-Beecher-Bain) as design philosophy | New framing needed in course overview or Week 1 synthesis |
| B2 | V1 + env.md | Operations named as economic in character | Course overview and six-moves document need economic framing |
| B3 | G3 | Grant notices six-moves ≈ institutional assessment | Course design should provide space for students to question framework |
| B4 | G4 | Vera explains countable-for-practitioner vs countable-for-institution | Conference week could include this vocabulary; depends on B2 existing first |
| B5 | G5 | Assessment skepticism during portfolio consolidation | Minor; character arc, not necessarily course content |
| B6 | G6 | Unresolved skepticism; denaturalization as ongoing practice | Reflective cover letter prompts could invite this questioning |

### Well-Aligned Scenes (No Action Needed)

| Scene | Week | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| G1 | 2 | Infrastructure setup matches precisely |
| V2 | 6-7 | BEAM classification now aligned with Borges/Quine → BEAM sequence |
| G2 | 7-8 | BEAM peer review + library parallel now aligned |
| V3 | 7 | Alexander/misfit/Constraint Audit alignment excellent |
| G3 | 8 | "What You're Automating" + Brooks matches well |
| V5 | 10 | Designer perspective on analytics; course doesn't need to match |
| G5 | 11 | BEAM Portfolio + distill move well-aligned |
| V6 | 13 | Permission flags fully developed in both |
| G6 | 15 | Envelope bookend locked from inception |

### Concept Introduction Timing (Quick Reference)

| Six Move | Webtext Primary Scene | Course First Appearance | Aligned? |
|----------|----------------------|------------------------|----------|
| Capture | G1 (Wk 2), V1 (Wk 1) | Week 1 Block 4 (operational); Week 2 (named) | ✅ |
| Classify | V2 (Wk 6-7) | Week 6 synthesis (BEAM), Week 7 Block 6 (operational) | ✅ |
| Route | G2 (Wk 7-8) | Week 7 Eli Review Cycle 3 (operational) | ✅ |
| Distill | G3 (Wk 8) | Week 11 synthesis (named); Week 8 implicit | ⚠️ Named late |
| Connect | V4/G4 (Wk 9) | Week 10 content mapping (operational) | ⚠️ Named late |
| Publish | G6 (Wk 15), V6 (Wk 13) | Week 13 synthesis (named) | ✅ |

## Priority Actions

### Immediate — COMPLETE

1. ~~**Resolve D1/D2**~~: V2 moved to Weeks 6-7, G2 moved to Weeks 7-8. Course design's SEAR→Zotero→Borges/Quine→BEAM constraint sequence preserved.

2. ~~**Fix D3**~~: Week 9 overview YAML updated to `movement: M3`.

### Short-Term (Before Scene Drafting)

3. **Address B1/B2**: Add denaturalization framing to student-facing materials. Candidates: course overview, six-moves document, M1 overview, Week 1 synthesis, dev log guide.

4. **Review "distill" and "connect" naming**: The six-move vocabulary is introduced progressively, but "distill" isn't explicitly named until Week 11 even though the operation happens from Week 8. Consider naming it earlier (Week 8 corpus inventory is a natural site).

### Medium-Term (During Scene Drafting)

5. **Ensure scene drafts reference readings**: Several scenes occur during weeks with important readings that the scene outlines don't foreground (V6/Bernstein, G5/Ribes & Jackson, G3/Brooks). Scene drafts should echo or respond to these readings.

6. **Consider B3/B6**: Decide whether the course design should explicitly create space for students to question the six-moves framework. If yes, this is a significant pedagogical addition. If no, Grant's skepticism remains purely narratological.
