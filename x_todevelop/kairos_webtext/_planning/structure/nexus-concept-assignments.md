# Nexus Concept Assignments: QUANTITATION

> [!info] Updated 2026-02-12
> This document has been updated to match the refined QUANTITATION sequence from `[[trees_principles]]`. The letter-to-concept mapping, reading arc, and scene connections now reflect the current authoritative sequence. For the comparison between the QUANTITATION sequence and the course's 15-week sequence, see `[[quantitation-course-sequence-mapping]]`.

## Reading Arc (Updated)

Based on the refined sequence in `trees_principles.md`, the conceptual arc moves through three phases:

1. **Economic Framework** (Q-A): Labor-capital cycle → operational vocabulary → technology definition → accumulation dynamics
2. **Constraint Design** (N-A₂): Generative expansion → infrastructure/difficulty → permission modes → sequencing principle
3. **Circulation & Transformation** (T₃-N₂): Dependencies → circulation → appropriation → decomposition

**Three-arc alignment with first-principles paragraphs:**
- **Nodes 1-4** establish the economic framework (paragraph 1 territory)
- **Nodes 5-9** develop constraint sequencing as design method (paragraph 2 territory)  
- **Nodes 10-12** trace circulation and transformation (paragraph 3 territory)

Within each arc, logic progresses from principle → mechanism → implication. Each node is self-contained, so a reader entering at any node can follow links backward and forward. The preferred sequence is a spine, not a corridor.

## Complete Mapping (Updated to Match trees_principles.md)

| Position | Tree | Concept | Sources/Notes |
|----------|------|---------|---------------|
| Q | Quercus (Oak) | Labor and Capital + Quantitation as Rhetoric | `writing-labor-capital`; Scenes: V1, G3 |
| U | Ulmus (Elm) | Six Moves vs. Writing Process | `six-moves-vocabulary`, `six-moves-process-pedagogy`; Scenes: V6, G6 ⚠️ |
| A | Acer (Maple) | Economy and Technology in Composition | TO WRITE; Scenes: TBD (likely V2, G4) |
| N | Nerium (Oleander) | Textual Accumulation + Archives Give Analytics | `textual-accumulation`; Scenes: V5, G5, G6 |
| T₁ | Taxus (Yew) | YOLO Up, Constrain Down | `yolo-up-constrain-down`; Scenes: V1, G1 |
| I | Ilex (Holly) | Infrastructure Visibility + Difficulty-as-Diagnostic | infrastructure portion of old Tsuga; absorbs difficulty-as-diagnostic; Scenes: G3, V5 ⚠️ |
| T₂ | Thuja (Cedar) | Permission Flags | `permission-flags`; Scenes: V6, G6 ⚠️ |
| A₂ | Alnus (Alder) | Constraint Sequencing | `constraint-sequencing`; Scenes: V1, V3, G3 |
| T₃ | Tsuga (Hemlock) | Citation as Dependency | `citation-as-dependency`; Scenes: G3, V5 |
| I₂ | Illicium (Star Anise) | Circulation | TO WRITE (circulation); Scenes: G2, V4, G6 |
| O | Olea (Olive) | Appropriation and Value | TO WRITE (appropriation and value); Scenes: TBD (likely V2 or G4) |
| N₂ | Nyssa (Tupelo) | Corpse, Compost, Garden | `corpse-compost-garden`; Scenes: G5, G6 |

**Note:** ⚠️ indicates scene conflicts that may require resolution or that may productively illuminate intersection points.
