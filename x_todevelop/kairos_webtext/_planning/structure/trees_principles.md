# 1. Q — Quercus (Labor and Capital + Quantitation as Rhetoric)

**Scenes**: V1, G3 | **Sources**: `writing-labor-capital`

The argument begins with the fundamental economic relationship underlying all composition: the cyclical transformation between labor and capital. Writing-as-verb and writing-as-noun name two phases of a single process—human effort creates textual artifacts, and textual artifacts inform and enable future human effort. This cycle is not merely metaphorical but describes an actual economic dynamic within composition pedagogy. Quantitation enters here as the rhetorical operation that makes this transformation countable and therefore visible: how much writing, how many drafts, what accumulates. The scenes at this position (V1 establishing design rationale, G3 encountering the framework) introduce readers to an economic vocabulary for what happens when students write.

# 2. U — Ulmus (Six Moves vs. Writing Process)

**Scenes**: V2, G2 | **Sources**: `six-moves-vocabulary`, `six-moves-process-pedagogy`

With labor-capital dynamics established, the argument turns to competing vocabularies for describing what writers do. Traditional writing process pedagogy offers one cycle (prewriting → drafting → revising → editing → publishing); the six moves vocabulary offers another framework derived from systems thinking that foregrounds capture, composition, and configuration. The comparison reveals not contradiction but complementary lenses—process pedagogy emphasizes temporal stages while six moves emphasizes operational relationships between human attention and textual material. This nexus offers a rationale for integrating systems thinking: not to replace process pedagogy but to make visible what it sometimes obscures about how text and attention interact. The early-semester scene positions reflect where vocabulary encounter actually happens: Vera designing the framework's introduction (V2) and Grant first encountering an alternative to the process language he arrived with (G2).

# 3. A — Acer (Economy and Technology in Composition)

**Scenes**: G1, V4 | **Sources**: TO WRITE

Questions raised by labor-capital dynamics point toward a definition: technology substitutes capital (or capital-intensive processes) for labor (or labor-intensive processes). Writing is a technology in precisely this sense—orthographic systems, genres, citation conventions all represent accumulated solutions that reduce the cognitive labor of future writers. If writing is a technology, then the study of writing instruction becomes a suitable and necessary domain for economic inquiry. This positions composition studies not as borrowing economic metaphors but as engaging in actual economic analysis of pedagogical processes. Grant's opening-week scene (G1) foregrounds the differentials of the course's tech stack—note cards, Eli Review, folder structures—making the technological substrate of writing visible as accumulated capital before he writes a word. Vera's mid-semester reflection (V4) recognizes that the technologies she chose for the course are not neutral delivery mechanisms but capital-intensive substitutions for labor-intensive processes: the definitional point enacted through design.

# 4. N — Nerium (Textual Accumulation + Archives Give Analytics)

**Scenes**: V5, G5, G6 | **Sources**: `textual-accumulation`

Economic inquiry into composition examines both pedagogical processes (learning by doing, writing-as-verb) and the accumulated textual capital that permits reconfiguration for future writing (writing-as-noun). Textual accumulation names the deliberate pedagogical strategy of building archives that students can draw upon—not merely saving drafts but creating accessible repositories of prior work. Archives give analytics: the accumulated text becomes analyzable, revealing patterns invisible in any single piece. This nexus connects labor (the scenes show Grant's experience of accumulating work across the semester) with the capital that accumulation produces (Vera's design for making archives pedagogically productive). The absorption of "archives give analytics" into this position strengthens the connection between storage and analysis.

# 5. T₁ — Taxus (YOLO Up, Constrain Down)

**Scenes**: V1, G1 | **Sources**: `yolo-up-constrain-down`

In order to promote the accumulation of textual capital, composition pedagogy has long suggested generative writing exercises without constraint—freewriting, brainstorming, invention heuristics. Systems thinkers and engineers share this intuition but frame it differently: early-stage design promotes imagination without constraint and maximum generative possibility; refinement comes later. "YOLO up, constrain down" names this temporal sequence as itself a constraint to be designed. The phrase recovers Peter Elbow's generative pedagogy against social-turn critiques by showing its structural rather than merely expressive rationale. Scenes V1 and G1 position this principle at the course's opening—both designer and student encounter the same logic from different vantages.

# 6. I — Ilex (Infrastructure Visibility + Difficulty-as-Diagnostic)

**Scenes**: G2, V5 | **Sources**: infrastructure portion of old Tsuga; absorbs difficulty-as-diagnostic

The experience of difficulty can be a diagnostic illuminating the presence and nature of constraints otherwise invisible. Following Susan Leigh Star, infrastructure becomes visible primarily upon breakdown—the systems that support writing (technological, generic, institutional) reveal themselves when they fail to function smoothly. Folding difficulty-as-diagnostic into infrastructure visibility strengthens both concepts: difficulty is not deficiency but signal, and infrastructure study requires attention to where things go wrong. Grant's first encounter with genuine friction (G2) exposes infrastructure he did not know existed—the gap between what he expected writing in college to feel like and the systems actually operating on his work. Vera's later design reflections (V5) reframe that same friction as productive information, demonstrating how pedagogical difficulty can be read rather than remediated. The temporal separation between Grant's experience and Vera's analysis performs the diagnostic logic: difficulty arrives first, understanding follows.

# 7. T₂ — Thuja (Permission Flags)

**Scenes**: V6, G6 | **Sources**: `permission-flags`

The UNIX concept of permission flags—who can read, write, or execute, and in what contexts—offers a heuristic for thinking about constraint modes and ownership. Applied to composition pedagogy, permission flags ask: What constraints operate on this text? Who controls them? What can be adjusted? This framework makes visible the distribution of agency across student, instructor, institution, and genre. The heuristic moves toward constraint sequencing (position 8) by establishing that constraints have not just content but modes of access and control. The late-semester scene positions are deliberate: by V6, Vera can reflect on how permission redistribution operated across the full course arc, and by G6, Grant can recognize retrospectively the access trajectory he has lived through—private draft to peer review to institutional portfolio—as a designed sequence rather than an accident.

# 8. A₂ — Alnus (Constraint Sequencing)

**Scenes**: V1, V3, G3 | **Sources**: `constraint-sequencing`

Sequences will shape rewards gained from following them; one useful strategy is to determine what constraints are present and then sequence their arrival to allow for maximum benefit gained from human labor. Constraint sequencing names the central pedagogical design principle: not which constraints to impose but when they arrive and what handles them. This is the article's primary theoretical contribution—a framework for thinking about temporal design in composition pedagogy. The multiple Vera scenes (V1, V3) show constraint sequencing as a design problem; G3 shows it as a student experience of encountering constraints in deliberate order. This position sits at the center of the QUANTITATION sequence, reflecting its centrality to the overall argument.

# 9. T₃ — Tsuga (Citation as Dependency)

**Scenes**: G3, V5 | **Sources**: `citation-as-dependency`

Technological innovations that help answer questions about constraint sequencing include citations—in the conventional library sense, they allow one to trace sequences of post-publication academic argument, but in the local sense they function as pointers, notes, or hyperlinks connecting ideas. Constraint sequencing and the six moves make use of this second sense: citations as dependency declarations that say "these are related" or "this needs X and Y to succeed." Citations carry context and carry the dependencies of arguments, making visible what any given text requires to function. This repositions citation instruction from compliance with academic convention toward understanding how texts announce and manage their conceptual dependencies. Grant's mid-semester scene (G3) shows citation dependency as a student encounter—the moment when sources stop being compliance objects and start functioning as structural requirements. Vera's reflection (V5) analyzes the same shift from the designer's perspective, connecting citation infrastructure to the broader visibility argument developed in Ilex (position 6).

# 10. I₂ — Illicium (Circulation)

**Scenes**: G2, V4, G6 | **Sources**: TO WRITE (circulation)

Citations as dependency networks help track the time-based stages of economic circulation that draw on labor and capital: production, distribution, use, and reproduction. Following John Trimbur, circulation is not merely what happens after writing but a dynamic that shapes writing at every stage. The scenes at this position (G2 showing early encounter with circulation questions, V4 showing mid-semester design adjustments, G6 showing end-of-term synthesis) trace how circulation awareness develops across the course. This nexus connects backward to citation dependency and forward to appropriation—if texts circulate, then value moves, and the question becomes who captures it and how.

# 11. O — Olea (Appropriation and Value)

**Scenes**: G4, V3 | **Sources**: TO WRITE (appropriation and value)

Value gets appropriated at each stage of circulation by various participants and enterprises—not just capitalist cash-grabbers but people donating, enjoying, or improving the value of their labor. Appropriation names the process by which circulating value gets captured, redirected, or transformed. In composition pedagogy, this raises questions about who benefits from student writing labor: students themselves (through learning and credential), institutions (through assessment and retention), future readers (through accessible ideas), or the broader discourse community. This nexus makes explicit what the labor-capital framework established at position 1 only implied: that economic analysis of composition includes questions of distribution and benefit. Grant's mid-to-late semester scene (G4) shows the moment when accumulated labor becomes visible as something others capture—instructor evaluation, institutional metrics, peer use—making appropriation concrete rather than abstract. Vera's mid-semester design adjustment (V3) reveals the designer grappling with how her course distributes value: are students appropriating what she intended, or is the institution extracting something she didn't design for? The shared V3 scene with Alnus (constraint sequencing) is productive: constraint sequencing shapes who appropriates value, so the same design reflection analyzed through both lenses yields a genuine insight about the relationship between temporal design and distributional outcomes. The "diverse economies" framework from Gibson-Graham and the class-analytic apparatus from Resnick and Wolff are particularly relevant here.

# 12. N₂ — Nyssa (Corpse, Compost, Garden)

**Scenes**: G5, G6 | **Sources**: `corpse-compost-garden`

The cycle of appropriation leads into the final composting metaphor: growth from corpse to soil for seed to seedling to bush to branch, with both tending-labor and producing-labor, both self-appropriating and other-appropriating behaviors. The metaphor refuses the binary between creation and destruction—dead text becomes substrate for new growth, failed drafts nourish future writing. This position returns to the labor-capital dynamic of position 1 but transformed: where Quercus established the cycle abstractly, Nyssa shows it as organic process with death built in. Grant's late-semester scenes (G5, G6) demonstrate how accumulated textual capital becomes available for composting—not preserved intact but decomposed and reconstituted. The sequence closes by opening: corpse-compost-garden implies continuation beyond any single semester.

# 1. Writing as Economic Cycle

## Claim
The transformation between writing labor and textual capital offers not just a useful metaphor borrowed from economics for composition pedagogy, but an economic cycle tracing the production of real-world value.

## Elaboration
If composition scholars understand writing as a technology, and technologies function to replace labor-intensive processes with capital-intensive processes, then that replacement is by definition economic. The cycle of production, distribution, use, and reproduction describes what happens to texts as they move through the stages of composing, sharing, reading, and remaking. Naming this cycle as economic rather than figurative has consequences: it means the tools of economic analysis—value, labor, capital, appropriation—apply directly to the work of the composition classroom rather than being imported as heuristic. It also means that questions about who benefits from that cycle, and at what stage, become answerable in both political and structural terms.

# 2. Operational Vocabulary

## Claim
A vocabulary naming what happens to information as writers work—capture, classify, route, distill, connect, publish—makes the discrete operations of composition visible, countable, and therefore designable.
  
## Elaboration
Traditional process vocabulary describes temporal stages: prewriting, drafting, revising. These terms name when writers work but obscure what writers do to information at each stage. The six moves—capture, classify, route, distill, connect, publish—are the operations themselves: taking material in, sorting it, directing it somewhere, compressing it, linking it to other material, and releasing it into circulation. Because the vocabulary describes re-sequenceable operations on information rather than phases of a writer's experience, it applies regardless of genre, medium, or institutional context. The operations become countable—a pedagogical design can specify how many captures precede the first distillation, or when connection begins relative to routing—and countability is what makes deliberate sequencing possible.

# 3. Textual Accumulation

## Claim
Textual accumulation transforms student writing from discrete assessed performances into analyzable capital available for future reconfiguration.

## Elaboration
Writing pedagogy that treats each assignment as a freestanding performance discards the residue of past labor. A student who writes five essays has five grades; a student who accumulates a corpus of fragments, drafts, and revisions has material that compounds. Accumulation means past writing remains available as input to future writing: an early fragment supplies a claim for a later argument; a failed draft reveals a structural problem that informs the next attempt. The shift from performance to accumulation is itself economic—it is the difference between spending and saving, between labor consumed in the moment of assessment and labor stored as capital. Because writing substitutes accumulated solutions for present cognitive effort, a deliberately managed corpus reduces the cognitive cost of each successive composing act.

# 4. Generation Before Evaluation

## Claim
Maximizing early possibility before introducing constraint creates conditions for accumulation that cannot be achieved by frontloading requirements.

## Elaboration
Generative writing pedagogies share a structural principle with systems engineering: expand the solution space before narrowing it. Introducing evaluative constraints too early truncates the range of material available for later refinement, and that truncation is irreversible—you cannot recover possibilities that were never generated. The principle is not permissiveness but sequence: constraints arrive, but they arrive after the material they will act upon exists. Generation working against minimal constraint encounters resistance—topics that don't develop, moves that stall, methods that produce nothing usable—and that resistance is itself informational. The resistance reveals which directions are productive before the writer has committed to any of them.

# 5. Generation as Experience Good

## Claim 
Generation is an experience good: its value can only be realized through the doing, assessed only retrospectively, and destroyed by premature interruption.

## Elaboration
An experience good is one whose quality cannot be determined before consumption. A writer following felt sense through an early draft cannot know in advance what the draft will yield; the value of the generative act is constituted by the experience itself, not accessed through it. This is an economic claim, not a psychological one: it identifies a category of labor whose value is structurally destroyed by externalization or preemptive assessment. Requiring writers to justify their generative choices during generation is not merely distracting—it forecloses value that cannot be recovered, because the experience that would have produced it did not occur. The pedagogical implication is that the space of generation must be protected from evaluative constraint not as indulgence but as economic necessity.

# 6. Difficulty as Diagnostic

## Claim
Writing difficulty functions as diagnostic signal, exposing infrastructural constraints that remain invisible until a writer pushes against them.

## Elaboration
Difficulty is not noise in the composing process; it is information about the system the writer operates within. When generation stalls, the stall locates a constraint—a gap in knowledge, a structural problem in the argument, a mismatch between the writer's intentions and the available material. These constraints are infrastructural in the sense that they are embedded in the writing situation itself rather than imposed by external evaluation. They become visible only through the encounter: a writer who never attempts the argument never discovers the gap. Treating difficulty as diagnostic rather than as failure changes the pedagogical response from remediation to investigation—the question shifts from "what did the writer do wrong?" to "what does this difficulty reveal about the constraints operating here?"

# 7. Constraint Modes and Ownership

## Claim
Constraints possess identifiable properties—visibility, rationale, writability, ownership—that pedagogical design can redistribute across participants and across time.

## Elaboration
Not all constraints operate in the same way. Some are visible to the writer; others are hidden in institutional expectations or genre conventions. Some have articulable rationales; others are inherited without explanation. Some are fixed; others are negotiable. Some belong to the instructor, the institution, the discipline, or the writer. Making these properties explicit transforms constraints from background conditions into designable elements of a pedagogy. A course can decide which constraints to make visible when, which rationales to disclose at what stage, and which ownership to transfer from instructor to student as the semester progresses. The progressive redistribution of constraint ownership is itself a model of how writers develop agency: not by escaping constraints but by learning to identify, negotiate, and manage them.

# 8. Constraint Arrival

## Claim
The temporal sequence in which constraints arrive shapes learning outcomes more decisively than the content of those constraints.

## Elaboration
Two courses with identical constraint sets—same formatting requirements, same citation expectations, same rubric criteria—will produce different learning outcomes if the constraints arrive in different sequences. Front-loading all constraints simultaneously creates cognitive overload that inhibits generation; introducing them progressively creates a rhythm of expansion and refinement that supports accumulation. This principle extends beyond individual assignments to course-level design: early weeks operate under minimal constraint to build corpus; middle weeks introduce organizational and citational constraints as the material they act upon accumulates; late weeks layer evaluative and presentational constraints onto material that has already undergone multiple transformations. The sequence is the design. Changing the content of a constraint matters less than changing when it arrives.

# 9. Machine Delegation

## Claim
Some constraints are delegable to machines because their value does not depend on experiential realization; deliberate delegation concentrates human attention on the constraints that remain irreducibly experiential.

## Elaboration
Writing technologies have always replaced labor-intensive processes with capital-intensive ones—the printing press, the typewriter, the word processor each delegated specific operations from human labor to mechanical capital. The relevant question for pedagogy is not whether to delegate but which constraints to delegate: those whose value is procedural and repeatable (formatting, version control, metadata management, structural templates) versus those whose value depends on the unrepeatable encounter between a writer and a problem (rhetorical judgment, invention, the navigation of difficulty). Machine delegation of the former is not automation of writing but clarification of where human writing labor is irreplaceable. Making the delegation explicit—showing students which constraints the machine handles and which remain theirs—is itself pedagogically productive, because it surfaces the distinction between procedural and experiential work that much writing instruction leaves unmarked.

# 10. Citation as Dependency

## Claim
Citations declare the dependencies a text requires to succeed and trace the sequence through which value gets appropriated across stages of production.

## Elaboration
Citation is conventionally taught as attribution—giving credit to sources. But citation also functions as dependency management: each citation declares that this text requires that text in order to do its work, just as a software module declares its dependencies on other modules. The dependency framing makes visible what the attribution framing obscures: that a text is a node in a network of value circulation, not a freestanding object that happens to acknowledge its influences. Tracing citations as dependencies reveals the economic structure of knowledge production—which texts enable which other texts, where value accumulates, and where it gets extracted. Teaching citation as dependency rather than attribution shifts the pedagogical emphasis from compliance (did you cite correctly?) to analysis (what does your text need, and where does that need come from?).

# 11. Reading as Productive Consumption

## Claim
Reading is the "activating labor" (Edwards, in progress manuscript) that activates the use stage of the economic cycle, setting inert textual capital in motion and completing one cycle of appropriation while generating material that enters the next.

## Elaboration
A text that is not read is information without use-value: potential meaning that has not been realized. Reading performs the activation that transforms textual capital from inert storage into circulating value—it is productive consumption, the economic complement to the productive labor of writing. Like generation, reading is an experience good: a text's value to its reader cannot be determined before the encounter and cannot be extracted without it. This means reading is not reception but the _activating labor_ associated with an experience good, and that labor produces something—associations, responses, disagreements, new questions—that becomes input to the next cycle of writing. The cycle of production, distribution, use, and reproduction is therefore also a cycle of writing, sharing, reading, and rewriting. Reading and writing are not opposed activities but two forms of the same transformative work, distinguished by their positions in the circulation sequence.

# 12. Decomposition Over Preservation

## Claim
Textual decomposition enables future writing growth more effectively than textual preservation does: the corpse of one text becomes compost for the next.

## Elaboration
A finished text preserved intact is capital frozen in its final form—available for reference but resistant to reconfiguration. A text decomposed into its constituent elements—claims, evidence, structures, phrases—returns those elements to the corpus as material available for reassembly. Decomposition is not destruction but transformation: it moves textual capital from a low-entropy state (organized, coherent, finished) to a high-entropy state (disaggregated, available, reconfigurable) that is more productive for future writing. The metaphor is ecological: a dead organism that remains intact persists but does not nourish; one that decomposes feeds new growth. Pedagogies that emphasize preservation—the polished essay archived as a finished product—foreclose this generative cycle. Pedagogies that emphasize decomposition—the portfolio disassembled into fragments that re-enter the corpus—keep the cycle turning.

---

The transformation between writing labor and textual capital constitutes an economic cycle. Traditional process vocabulary describes this cycle's temporal stages (prewriting, drafting, revising) but obscures the operational relationships between human attention and textual material. A six moves vocabulary (capture, classify, route, distill, connect, publish) names instead what happens to information as writers work, making the discrete operations of composition visible, countable, and therefore designable. Because writing substitutes accumulated solutions for present cognitive effort, composition studies operates as a domain of economic inquiry rather than a borrower of economic metaphors. Deliberate pedagogical design can exploit this dynamic: textual accumulation transforms student writing from discrete assessed performances into analyzable capital available for future reconfiguration.

Generative writing pedagogies create conditions for such accumulation by enacting a principle shared with systems engineering: maximize early possibility, then use constraint to refine. Clearing visible constraints from the workspace opens space for generation; generation, working against what remains, encounters resistance that reveals which topics, moves, or methods might yield the greatest rewards. Writing difficulty thus functions as diagnostic signal, exposing infrastructural constraints that remain invisible until a writer pushes against them. Constraints themselves possess identifiable modes and ownership—who controls them, what contexts they operate in, what can be adjusted—that pedagogical design can redistribute. The temporal sequence in which constraints arrive shapes learning outcomes more decisively than the content of those constraints.

Constraint sequencing requires tools for tracking what each text depends on and where value moves across stages of production. Citations serve both functions: they declare the dependencies a text requires to succeed, and they trace the sequence through which value gets appropriated—production, distribution, use, and reproduction. Circulation dynamics shape writing at every one of these stages, not only after a text is "finished." Any economic analysis of composition must therefore account for who appropriates value from student writing labor—not only through market extraction but through self-appropriation, communal use, and gift. Textual decomposition enables future writing growth more effectively than textual preservation does: the corpse of one text becomes compost for the next.
