# Vignette Candidates

Vignettes are short narrative moments (500-800 words) that supplement full scenes, covering weeks or concepts not narrated in the 12 main scenes.

## Confirmed Vignettes

### Week 3: Grant's Salvatori Confusion

**Placement**: Nexus page Nyssa (Difficulty-as-Diagnostic)  
**Focus**: First encounter with difficult reading; confusion as productive  
**Key moment**: Grant unable to parse Salvatori [[@salvatori1996conve]], wondering if he's "not smart enough"  
**Connects to**: V3 (Vera reading audits that document this struggle)

### Week 12: Grant's Selection Paralysis / Process Archaeology Discovery

**Placement**: Nexus page Acer (Corpse→Compost→Garden) or Thuja (Archives/Analytics)  
**Focus**: Paralysis facing accumulated fragments; discovery through Process Archaeology  
**Key moment**: Grant realizes "dead" fragments contain seeds; archives reveal patterns  
**Connects to**: G5 (consolidation), G6 (final selection)

## Potential Additional Vignettes

### Week 6: Grant's SEAR Moment

**Placement**: Nexus page Olea (Circulation) or within G2  
**Focus**: Learning citation as conversation, not decoration  
**Status**: May fold into G2 instead

### Week 14: Presentation Preparation

**Placement**: Brief mention in G6 or standalone  
**Focus**: Public speaking as publication form  
**Status**: Low priority; probably brief mention only

## Vignette Style Notes

- Grant's first-person voice
- Present tense for immediacy
- Focus on single moment, not span
- End with partial recognition (not full clarity)
- Shorter than full scenes (500-800 words vs. 1200-1500)
