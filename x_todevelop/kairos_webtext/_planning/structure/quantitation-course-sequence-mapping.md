# QUANTITATION Sequence ↔ Course Sequence Mapping

> [!info] Purpose<br/>
> Compare the webtext's QUANTITATION sequence (the "ideal" conceptual order of principles, as refined in `trees_principles`) against the course design's 15-week experiential sequence (as locked in the consolidated schedule). The goal is not to force alignment but to identify where the sequences track, where they productively diverge, and where mismatches create genuine problems for either project.

> [!important] Framing<br/>
> QUANTITATION as concept is not a celebration of making things countable. It names the core tension between **efficiency-as-problem** (appropriation of experience-good writerly value the writer does not consent to) and **efficiency-as-tool** (VIRENS process/systems pedagogy that uses machine efficiency and information-flow principles to _carve out_ the time-space for experience-good activating-labor as invention). The question the webtext poses is: what does/can quantitation — as opposed to quantification — _do_?

## The Two Sequences

### QUANTITATION (Webtext Argument Order)

| Pos | Letter | Principle | Claim (condensed) |
|-----|--------|-----------|-------------------|
| 1 | Q — Quercus | Labor-Capital Cycle | Writing labor ↔ textual capital is an economic cycle, not a metaphor |
| 2 | U — Ulmus | Operational Vocabulary | Six moves make operations visible, countable, designable |
| 3 | A — Acer | Economy and Technology | Writing _is_ technology; composition studies _is_ economic inquiry |
| 4 | N — Nerium | Textual Accumulation | Deliberate corpus-building transforms performance into capital |
| 5 | T₁ — Taxus | Generation Before Evaluation | YOLO up; generation is an experience good destroyed by premature constraint |
| 6 | I — Ilex | Difficulty-as-Diagnostic | Difficulty exposes infrastructure; breakdown reveals hidden systems |
| 7 | T₂ — Thuja | Permission Flags | Constraints have modes (visibility, ownership, writability) that are redistributable |
| 8 | A₂ — Alnus | Constraint Sequencing | _When_ constraints arrive shapes outcomes more than _what_ they are |
| 9 | T₃ — Tsuga | Citation as Dependency | Citations declare what a text needs to function |
| 10 | I₂ — Illicium | Circulation | Production → distribution → use → reproduction shapes writing at every stage |
| 11 | O — Olea | Appropriation and Value | Who captures value at each circulation stage, and how? |
| 12 | N₂ — Nyssa | Decomposition Over Preservation | Corpse → compost → garden; dead text feeds new growth |

## The Structural Divergence

The two sequences follow fundamentally different logics:

**QUANTITATION argues from premises to applications.** It establishes the economic frame (Q), the vocabulary that makes it operational (U), the definitional warrant (A), and the strategy that follows (N) — and _then_ introduces the experiential reality (T₁: generation as experience good) that complicates the apparatus. The remainder of the sequence works out what constraint design looks like given both the countable apparatus (vocabulary, accumulation, technology) and the uncountable reality (experience goods, difficulty, infrastructure invisibility).

**The course moves from experience to naming.** Students _do_ generation before they have vocabulary for it. They encounter difficulty before they have a diagnostic framework. They accumulate text before "accumulation" is named as a strategy. The course's pedagogical logic is that naming must follow experience — otherwise vocabulary arrives as empty abstraction.

This is not an accident. It's the _enactment_ of the webtext's own argument about experience goods. If generation's value is constituted by the doing, then a course that pre-names the value before the experience destroys it. The course's sequence _performs_ what QUANTITATION position 5 _argues_. The webtext, addressing scholars, can name the economic frame first because its readers are not in the experience — they're analyzing someone else's.

The question, then, is not whether the sequences should be identical but whether each sequence is internally coherent and whether the _mapping between them_ is legible to a reader who encounters both.

---

## Position-by-Position Mapping

### Position 1: Q — Labor-Capital Cycle

**QUANTITATION placement:** First. The economic frame is the argument's foundation.

**Course equivalent:** Never explicitly named in student-facing materials.

**Week of implicit introduction:** Week 1 (course overview uses "accumulation" and "intellectual capital" language) and Week 8 ("What You're Automating" makes labor/capital substitution visible).

**Alignment status:** ❌ **Critical gap**

**Analysis:** This is the gap identified in session digest Q6. The webtext's entire argument rests on treating writing as an economic cycle — but the course that supposedly enacts this argument doesn't name the cycle to students. The course overview uses economic language ("accumulation," "capital") _descriptively_ without marking it as _economic_. Week 8's "What You're Automating" makes the labor-capital substitution explicit for a specific case (machine delegation), but this is Week 8, not Week 1. 

The QUANTITATION framing helps clarify what's at stake: if quantitation is the operation that makes labor-capital transformation countable and visible, then the course delays quantitation's _naming function_ even as it uses quantitation's _design function_ (fragment counts, process documentation, progressive constraint introduction) from Week 1. This is defensible — the course uses the tools of quantitation without celebrating or even naming them — but the webtext claims the course names its operations as economic. That naming needs to happen somewhere students see it.

**Recommendation:** This is the denaturalization backflow (B2). The course overview or Week 1 synthesis should mark the economic vocabulary as deliberate and economic, not merely descriptive. This doesn't require frontloading theory — it requires one moment where the course says "we're using economic language because writing involves economic relationships."

---

### Position 2: U — Operational Vocabulary (Six Moves)

**QUANTITATION placement:** Second. With the economic frame established, the argument introduces the vocabulary that makes writing operations countable.

**Course equivalent:** Progressive introduction across the whole semester.

| Move | First Operational | First Named |
|------|------------------|-------------|
| Capture | Week 1 (fragment capture) | Week 1-2 |
| Classify | Week 6 (BEAM) | Week 6 |
| Route | Week 3 (peer feedback) | Week 7 |
| Distill | Week 8 (corpus inventory) | Week 11 (named); Week 8 per session digest decision |
| Connect | Week 9 (conference) | Week 10 |
| Publish | Week 13 (permission flags) | Week 13 |

**Alignment status:** ⚠️ **Structural divergence, not contradiction**

**Analysis:** QUANTITATION positions the six moves as the vocabulary that makes the economic argument operational — position 2 out of 12, immediately after the economic frame. The course introduces moves progressively across 15 weeks, foregrounding each at the movement boundary where students are actually performing it. The course's logic is sound: vocabulary arrives when experience makes it meaningful. But the webtext's logic is also sound: the vocabulary is what makes the economic frame _actionable_ rather than merely descriptive.

The divergence illuminates the quantitation tension. The six moves vocabulary _is_ an instrument of quantitation — it makes writing operations countable (how many captures, when does classification begin, etc.). The course deploys this instrument gradually, protecting the experience-good quality of early writing from premature operationalization. But that means the full apparatus of countability isn't available to students until late in the semester, which limits their ability to engage in the diagnostic/analytical work the later moves (distill, connect, publish) require.

The "distill" naming gap (operational at Week 8, named at Week 11) is the sharpest instance. The session digest already decided to name it at Week 8. This should be done.

**Recommendation:** No fundamental structural change needed. The progressive introduction _enacts_ a constraint sequence. But the webtext should explicitly theorize why the course's order of introduction (capture → classify → route → distill → connect → publish) differs from the webtext's argumentative presentation, and why the lag between operation and naming is pedagogically productive rather than incidental.

---

### Position 3: A — Economy and Technology

**QUANTITATION placement:** Third. Writing _is_ technology; composition studies _is_ economic inquiry.

**Course equivalent:** Week 2 (Ong: writing restructures consciousness) + Week 8 ("What You're Automating" + Brooks).

**Alignment status:** ⚠️ **Split across the semester**

**Analysis:** QUANTITATION treats the definitional claim (writing is a technology that substitutes capital for labor) as a single position that follows directly from the vocabulary. The course splits this across two moments: Ong at Week 2 addresses writing-as-technology (writing restructures consciousness = writing _does something to you_, which is the experiential side); Brooks/"What You're Automating" at Week 8 addresses the substitution logic (technology replaces labor with capital, which is the economic side).

This split actually maps onto the quantitation tension beautifully — but only if it's narrated. Ong gives students the experience-good argument for writing-as-technology: writing changes how you think, and that change can only happen through doing. Week 8 gives them the efficiency argument: technology substitutes capital for labor, and the question is whether that substitution serves or undermines the experience. Six weeks of writing practice _between_ these two framings means students have accumulated evidence with which to evaluate the substitution claim. They know what generation felt like (Weeks 1-3); they've encountered constraint (Weeks 4-7); now they can ask what automation does to the relationship between the two.

**Recommendation:** The webtext should narrate this split as deliberate rather than accidental. Ong and Brooks are not redundant framings of the same concept but two halves of the same argument, separated by the experience that makes the second half meaningful.

---

### Position 4: N — Textual Accumulation

**QUANTITATION placement:** Fourth. With the economic frame, vocabulary, and technology definition in place, the argument introduces the pedagogical strategy of deliberate corpus-building.

**Course equivalent:** Ongoing from Week 1 (fragment accumulation begins immediately), with explicit naming at Week 8 (corpus inventory) and Week 10 (Star's "archives give analytics").

**Alignment status:** ✅ **Aligned in practice, with naming lag**

**Analysis:** This is the closest tracking between the two sequences in terms of substance. The course _does_ textual accumulation from the very first block. The fragment target of 40-50 by Week 12 is itself an act of quantitation — making accumulation countable. The divergence is in naming: QUANTITATION positions accumulation as a conscious strategy (position 4, established before generation), while the course has students accumulating before they know why.

This is again the experience-good logic: students accumulate before the strategy is named because naming the strategy before they've experienced accumulation would reduce it to compliance. A student told "build a corpus of 40 fragments as an economic strategy" in Week 1 faces a production target. A student told "write every day" in Week 1 and who discovers in Week 8 that they've built a corpus faces a revelation — their labor has produced capital they didn't plan to create.

The quantitation angle: accumulation-as-strategy is efficiency-as-tool. It's the VIRENS move of using countability (fragment counts, corpus inventory) to protect and make visible the value of generative labor. But it risks becoming efficiency-as-problem if fragment counting becomes the point rather than the diagnostic. The course's delay in naming accumulation protects against this.

**Recommendation:** Aligned. The webtext should narrate the delay in naming as integral to the course's constraint sequence — accumulation-as-strategy is itself a constraint whose arrival is designed.

---

### Position 5: T₁ — YOLO Up, Constrain Down (Generation as Experience Good)

**QUANTITATION placement:** Fifth. After four positions establishing the economic apparatus, the argument introduces the thing that resists counting: generation as experience good.

**Course equivalent:** Weeks 1-3 (M1: Surfacing). This is the _first_ thing students do.

**Alignment status:** ❌ **Inverted — and productively so, but the inversion needs theorizing**

**Analysis:** This is the most significant structural inversion between the sequences. QUANTITATION puts the experience-good argument at position 5 — after the economic frame, vocabulary, technology definition, and accumulation strategy. The course puts it at position 1.

The inversion is not a flaw. It's the argument in action. The webtext builds the apparatus that reveals what's at stake in generation; the course _starts with_ what's at stake and builds the apparatus later. For students, generation must come first because it's the experience that everything else operates on. For scholars reading the webtext, the apparatus must come first because without it, generation looks like mere expressivism rather than an economic claim about experience goods.

But the inversion has a consequence for the webtext's own argument. If the webtext claims that the QUANTITATION sequence reflects "the ideal sequence of what the course teaches," then position 5 is a problem — the course doesn't teach generation fifth; it teaches it first. The resolution is that QUANTITATION reflects the ideal sequence of _understanding_ what the course teaches, not the ideal sequence of _doing_ what the course teaches. The course's doing-order is T₁ → I → U → A → N → T₃ → A₂ → T₂ → N₂ → I₂ → O → Q. The webtext's understanding-order is Q → U → A → N → T₁ → I → T₂ → A₂ → T₃ → I₂ → O → N₂.

**Recommendation:** The webtext should explicitly distinguish between the sequence of _enactment_ (the course) and the sequence of _comprehension_ (the webtext), and argue that the difference is not incidental but constitutive. The course that explained its economic logic before students generated would destroy the experience-good value it claims to protect. The webtext that described generation before establishing the economic frame would look like Elbow-style expressivism.

---

### Position 6: I — Difficulty-as-Diagnostic + Infrastructure Visibility

**QUANTITATION placement:** Sixth. After establishing the experience-good argument, the argument shows what happens when that experience encounters resistance.

**Course equivalent:** Week 3 (Salvatori: difficulty) + Week 10 (Star: infrastructure).

**Alignment status:** ⚠️ **Split across the semester — tracks QUANTITATION's logic but not its timing**

**Analysis:** QUANTITATION folds difficulty and infrastructure visibility together (the `trees_principles` absorbed difficulty-as-diagnostic into infrastructure visibility). The course separates them by seven weeks: Salvatori at Week 3 (difficulty as productive encounter with a text), Star at Week 10 (infrastructure becomes visible upon breakdown).

In QUANTITATION's argument, these belong together because difficulty _is_ infrastructure visibility — the experience of difficulty is the moment when invisible systems announce themselves. In the course, they're separated because students need to encounter difficulty early (Week 3, when they're still in M1's generative phase and haven't built enough infrastructure for "infrastructure" to mean anything) and infrastructure later (Week 10, when they've spent eight weeks building systems that they can now analyze).

The quantitation lens: difficulty-as-diagnostic is the moment when the quantitation apparatus meets something it can't count — the affective, embodied experience of being stuck. The diagnostic move is to _use_ quantitation (what constraint am I hitting? where in my process did this stall?) without _reducing_ the experience to its quantifiable dimensions. Infrastructure visibility is what makes that move possible: you can't diagnose what you can't see.

The course's seven-week gap between difficulty (Week 3) and infrastructure (Week 10) is the time it takes to build enough visible infrastructure to make the diagnostic move. Salvatori teaches students to _sit with_ difficulty; Star teaches them to _read_ it as signal about systems. The delay is a constraint sequence.

**Recommendation:** The webtext should narrate this separation as a constraint sequence within the course design. The gap between difficulty-as-experience (Salvatori, Week 3) and difficulty-as-signal (Star, Week 10) is the space where students build the diagnostic capacity that connects the two. This gap is evidence for constraint sequencing's central claim.

---

### Position 7: T₂ — Permission Flags

**QUANTITATION placement:** Seventh. Constraint modes and ownership — who controls what.

**Course equivalent:** Week 13 (full treatment).

**Alignment status:** ⚠️ **Much later in the course than in QUANTITATION**

**Analysis:** QUANTITATION positions permission flags _before_ constraint sequencing (position 8), arguing that you need to understand constraint modes before you can design sequences. The course positions permission flags at Week 13, after constraint sequencing has been taught (Week 7: Constraint Audit) and practiced (Weeks 8-11: BEAM Portfolio).

The course's logic: students need to have experienced constraint redistribution before they can name it. Permission flags describe what they've lived through — private drafts becoming public through peer review, instructor-controlled assignments giving way to student-chosen conference directions. Naming permission flags at Week 13 is a metacognitive move: "Here's the vocabulary for what's been happening to you all semester."

The QUANTITATION logic: readers need to understand constraint modes _as designable properties_ before they can see constraint sequencing as a design principle. Without permission flags, constraint sequencing looks like mere timeline management; with them, it becomes a question of progressive agency transfer.

**Recommendation:** This is a genuine tension. The webtext's order (T₂ → A₂) is more rigorous as argument: modes precede sequences. The course's order (A₂ → T₂) is more effective as pedagogy: experience precedes naming. The webtext should mark this inversion explicitly and argue that it's evidence for the article's claims about experience goods — even the course's own framework (constraint modes) is better encountered experientially than abstractly.

---

### Position 8: A₂ — Constraint Sequencing

**QUANTITATION placement:** Eighth — the structural center of the 12-position sequence.

**Course equivalent:** Week 7 (Constraint Audit) + implicit throughout.

**Alignment status:** ✅ **Aligned as center**

**Analysis:** Constraint sequencing is the central theoretical contribution of both projects. In QUANTITATION, it occupies position 8 of 12 — slightly past the midpoint, positioned after the apparatus that enables it (economic frame, vocabulary, accumulation, generation, difficulty, permission modes) and before the applications that follow from it (citation, circulation, appropriation, decomposition). In the course, the Constraint Audit assignment at Week 7 is the center of M2, and the principle operates implicitly across the entire course design.

The alignment here is strong: both sequences place constraint sequencing at or near their structural midpoint, with generative/expansive work preceding it and analytical/synthetic work following. The webtext's scene assignments for A₂ (V1, V3, G3) span Weeks 1, 7, and 8 — showing constraint sequencing as a design problem (V1), an analytical object (V3 reading audits), and a student experience (G3 recognizing what automation does).

**Recommendation:** Aligned. This is the hinge point where both sequences pivot from building to analyzing.

---

### Position 9: T₃ — Citation as Dependency

**QUANTITATION placement:** Ninth. After constraint sequencing, the argument shows how citations trace dependency and value networks.

**Course equivalent:** Progressive introduction: SEAR (Week 4) → Zotero (Week 5) → BEAM (Weeks 6-7) → source genealogy (Week 7).

**Alignment status:** ⚠️ **Earlier in the course than in QUANTITATION, but the dependency framing comes late**

**Analysis:** The course introduces citation _practices_ early (SEAR at Week 4) but doesn't frame citation _as dependency declaration_ until the source genealogy activity at Week 7 Block 5, and even then the dependency language isn't explicit in student-facing materials. QUANTITATION positions citation as dependency after constraint sequencing, arguing that understanding what a text _needs_ follows from understanding how constraints shape what texts _do_.

The course's SEAR→Zotero→Borges→BEAM sequence is itself a constraint sequence about citation (the session digest's "constraint sequence defense"). But the dependency framing — citation as "this text needs that text to function" — is a conceptual claim that the course doesn't make to students. Students learn citation as practice (how to integrate sources) and classification (what role does this source play) without the webtext's economic reframing (citation as dependency management in a value network).

**Recommendation:** The dependency framing is a webtext contribution that may or may not need course-level representation. If the course is meant to enact the webtext's claims, then the source genealogy activity at Week 7 is the natural site for naming citation-as-dependency. If the course is meant to create conditions that the webtext theorizes, then the gap is acceptable — students practice dependency management without naming it, and the webtext provides the name.

---

### Position 10: I₂ — Circulation

**QUANTITATION placement:** Tenth. Value moves through production → distribution → use → reproduction stages.

**Course equivalent:** Implicit throughout; peer review cycles are circulation events, but circulation is never named as such.

**Alignment status:** ❌ **Absent as an explicit concept in the course**

**Analysis:** This is the most significant absence. The course design creates multiple circulation events (six Eli Review cycles, instructor feedback moments, conference exchange, presentations, portfolio submission) but never names what they are — circulation stages where different parties appropriate different kinds of value. Students distribute their writing through peer review without a vocabulary for distribution as an economic operation. They receive feedback without framing feedback as one party's use of another party's productive labor.

QUANTITATION puts circulation at position 10, after constraint sequencing and citation, arguing that texts circulate through designed channels and that understanding those channels requires understanding both dependency (what the text needs) and constraint (what controls the text encounters). The course's peer review cycles _are_ designed channels — generous feedback (SPQ) vs. evaluative feedback (DES) protocols, progressive sophistication across six cycles — but the design is invisible to students as _circulation design_.

This connects directly to the quantitation tension. Circulation is where efficiency-as-problem becomes most visible: texts circulate through institutional channels (Canvas submissions, gradebook entries) where their value gets appropriated by assessment regimes. Making circulation visible to students would foreground the webtext's central question — what happens to writing when it enters systems designed to count it? — but might also create resistance to institutional processes the course requires.

**Recommendation:** This gap deserves careful attention. The webtext claims to theorize circulation, and the course creates multiple circulation moments. The question is whether the course should _name_ circulation or whether the naming belongs only to the webtext. If the course is to practice denaturalization (B2), then at least one moment should make circulation visible — perhaps Week 13's permission flags discussion, where the "publish" move is introduced as the moment texts enter circulation. Currently, permission flags and circulation occupy different QUANTITATION positions (7 and 10), but the course could fold them together productively at Week 13.

---

### Position 11: O — Appropriation and Value

**QUANTITATION placement:** Eleventh. Who captures value at each stage?

**Course equivalent:** Partly implicit in assessment design; partly represented in conference (Week 9) and portfolio (Weeks 12-15).

**Alignment status:** ❌ **Absent as explicit concept; present as design logic**

**Analysis:** The course's assessment design _is_ an appropriation design: formative work (50%) vs. portfolio (50%) represents a deliberate decision about how student labor gets valued. Peer review protocols determine who appropriates value from student writing (peers through learning, instructor through assessment, institution through retention metrics). But none of this is named as appropriation.

QUANTITATION's position 11 (Appropriation) is the economic argument's culmination before the ecological resolution (position 12). It makes explicit what positions 1-10 have been building toward: every stage of the writing-labor-to-textual-capital cycle involves value capture by various parties — students, instructors, institutions, discourse communities — and a course design distributes appropriation rights through its assessment structure, just as a permission flag system distributes access rights.

This is where Grant's skepticism arc (B3: six-moves ≈ institutional assessment) has its sharpest edge. If the course names its operations as economic but doesn't name who appropriates the value those operations produce, it naturalizes the course's own appropriation regime. The webtext can't credibly theorize appropriation if the course it describes leaves appropriation invisible to students.

**Recommendation:** The webtext needs the course to provide at least one moment where students confront appropriation. The most natural site is the Reflective Cover Letter at Week 15, where students could be asked: "Who benefited from your writing labor this semester? In what forms?" This doesn't require a theoretical vocabulary — it requires one reflective question that makes the course's own appropriation structure visible. Alternatively, the conference at Week 9 (where Vera/instructor explicitly discusses what the student's work reveals and what the institution sees) could perform this function narratively.

---

### Position 12: N₂ — Corpse, Compost, Garden

**QUANTITATION placement:** Twelfth and final. The cycle closes by opening: decomposition feeds future growth.

**Course equivalent:** Week 11 (BEAM Portfolio as composting — fragments decomposed and reconstituted), Week 13 (Bernstein's "Blood on the Cutting Room Floor"), Weeks 12-15 (portfolio selection as selective decomposition).

**Alignment status:** ✅ **Well aligned**

**Analysis:** Both sequences close with the ecological metaphor of decomposition and regeneration. QUANTITATION's final position returns to the labor-capital cycle of position 1, but transformed: where Q established the cycle abstractly, N₂ shows it as organic process with death built in. The course's final movement (M4: Synthesis) similarly returns to accumulated material and transforms it — portfolio assembly is simultaneously preservation (selecting polished work) and decomposition (disassembling the corpus to identify what's worth keeping).

The Bernstein reading at Week 13 is the course's strongest alignment with this position: "Blood on the Cutting Room Floor" is literally about what gets cut and why cutting is meaning-making. The psychic surgery metaphor in the Week 13 synthesis connects cutting to vivification — making alive by removing what's dead.

**Recommendation:** Aligned. The webtext should note that the course's closing arc performs decomposition-over-preservation: the portfolio is not a museum of finished work but a garden grown from composted material. The envelope exercise's return at Week 15 adds a layer — students' Week 1 predictions are themselves corpses that reveal how much decomposition and regrowth has occurred.

## Summary: Where the Sequences Track and Diverge

### Strong Alignment (no action needed)

| QUANTITATION Pos | Course Week(s) | Why it works |
|-----------------|----------------|--------------|
| 8: Constraint Sequencing | 7 (Constraint Audit) | Both place this at structural center |
| 12: Decomposition | 11-13 (Portfolio + Bernstein) | Both close with ecological transformation |
| 4: Textual Accumulation | 1-15 (ongoing) + 8 (named) | Course enacts it; naming arrives with experience |

### Productive Divergences (need theorizing, not fixing)

| QUANTITATION Pos | Course Order | Nature of Divergence |
|-----------------|-------------|---------------------|
| 5: Generation (pos. 5) | Weeks 1-3 (first) | Course starts with what QUANTITATION explains fifth; experience-good logic requires this |
| 2: Six Moves (pos. 2) | Progressive (Wks 1-13) | Course introduces moves when students perform them; QUANTITATION front-loads as apparatus |
| 6: Difficulty (pos. 6) | Week 3 + Week 10 (split) | Course separates encounter (Salvatori) from analytical framework (Star) by seven weeks |
| 7: Permission Flags (pos. 7) | Week 13 (late) | QUANTITATION needs modes before sequences; course needs experience before naming |
| 3: Technology (pos. 3) | Week 2 + Week 8 (split) | Experience-side (Ong) and efficiency-side (Brooks) separated by six weeks of practice |

### Problematic Gaps (need resolution)

| QUANTITATION Pos | Gap | Severity | Recommended Action |
|-----------------|-----|----------|-------------------|
| 1: Labor-Capital Cycle | Never explicitly named in student materials | High | Add denaturalization framing to course overview or Week 1 synthesis (B2) |
| 10: Circulation | Never named; multiple circulation events exist unnamed | Medium | Fold circulation vocabulary into Week 13 permission flags treatment |
| 11: Appropriation | Present as design logic but absent as concept students encounter | Medium | Add one reflective question to Week 15 cover letter or Week 9 conference |
| 9: Citation as Dependency | Dependency framing absent; citation taught as practice/classification | Low | Source genealogy at Week 7 is natural site if course should name this |

---

## The Quantitation Tension Across Both Sequences

Reading the mapping through the quantitation-as-concept lens reveals a pattern:

**QUANTITATION's first half (positions 1-6)** builds the tools of quantitation: the economic frame that makes value countable, the vocabulary that makes operations countable, the technology definition that makes substitution countable, the accumulation strategy that makes corpus growth countable. Then position 5 introduces what resists counting (experience goods), and position 6 shows where counting becomes diagnostic rather than extractive (difficulty reveals infrastructure).

**QUANTITATION's second half (positions 7-12)** designs with quantitation: permission flags distribute countable properties, constraint sequencing designs the temporal order of countable events, citation traces countable dependencies, circulation tracks countable stages of value movement, appropriation asks who counts and for whom, and decomposition shows that the counting cycle is never terminal.

**The course's first half (Weeks 1-7)** is where students _experience_ what resists quantitation: unconstrained generation, difficulty, the messiness of accumulation. The course protects the experience-good quality of early writing by withholding the quantitation apparatus.

**The course's second half (Weeks 8-15)** is where quantitation-as-tool becomes visible: corpus inventory, "What You're Automating," infrastructure analysis, permission flags, portfolio as designed selection. Students can now see what counting enables because they have uncounted experience to compare it against.

The pivot in both sequences is the same: the moment when countability shifts from being an external apparatus (the teacher's tool, the institution's instrument) to being the student's diagnostic resource. In QUANTITATION, this pivot is positions 5-6 (experience good → difficulty-as-diagnostic). In the course, this pivot is Weeks 7-8 (Constraint Audit → "What You're Automating"). The argumentative pivot and the experiential pivot occur at the same conceptual location even though they arrive at different points in their respective sequences.

This convergence is the strongest evidence that the two sequences are versions of the same argument — one addressed to scholars who can process the apparatus before the experience, one addressed to students who must have the experience before the apparatus makes sense.

## Open Questions for This Mapping

### OQ1: Should the webtext narrate the divergence? — RESOLVED

Yes. The env.md page has been updated to expressly acknowledge three layers:

- **Grant and Vera tracks** = experience (doing-order, the sequence of a semester as lived)
- **Nexus pages** = claims (understanding-order, the QUANTITATION sequence as argument)
- **Course design** (ENGL101 project, VIRENS, student-facing materials) = evidence (the empirical object the nexus pages theorize and the scenes narrate)

The env.md now explicitly states that the divergence between doing-order and understanding-order is itself evidence for the webtext's central claim about decomposition and resequencing. The three-layer structure means the webtext is not merely describing a course — it is performing the relationship between experience, theory, and evidence that the argument claims composition pedagogy should enact.

**File updated:** `content/supporting/env.md`

### OQ2: Does the course's silence on circulation and appropriation undermine the webtext? — RESOLVED

Yes — the silence needs to be broken. Both concepts need student-facing introduction.

**Decisions:**
- **Circulation** enters student-facing materials at **Week 13**, folded into the permission flags treatment. When "publish" is introduced as the sixth move (texts entering circulation), the course should name what circulation means: texts moving through production → distribution → use → reproduction, with different parties encountering and appropriating value at each stage.
- **Appropriation** enters via a reflective question in the **Week 15 cover letter** or **Week 9 conference**: "Who benefited from your writing labor this semester? In what forms?"
- **Labor-Capital Cycle** (B2 denaturalization) enters via the **course overview** or **Week 1 synthesis**: one moment of economic naming, not frontloaded theory.

**Files updated:** gap-analysis.md (new section on circulation/appropriation gaps). Student-facing course materials flagged for updates but not yet edited.

### OQ3: Where does the quantitation-as-concept inquiry enter the course? — RESOLVED

Week 8's "What You're Automating" is the site. The question extends from "what labor are you delegating to machines?" to "what happens to your writing when it becomes countable? who benefits from that countability?" This places the quantitation inquiry at the course's experiential pivot point (Weeks 7-8, where countability shifts from external apparatus to student diagnostic resource).

**Decision:** Add quantitation-as-concept to Week 8 in the Kairos webtext. Scene outline G3 updated with this requirement. Course-design-side implementation (adding the question to the Week 8 "What You're Automating" activity description) flagged but not yet executed.

### OQ4: Is the QUANTITATION sequence a doing-order or an understanding-order? — RESOLVED

QUANTITATION is the understanding-order; the course is the doing-order. The implicit message: the order of doing NEED NOT MATCH the order of understanding. This is part of what decomposition permits and performs — the same conceptual material, broken down and reassembled in different sequences for different purposes, produces different outcomes. The divergence between the two sequences is itself evidence for the webtext's decomposition argument. A text that can only be read in one order has not been decomposed; a pedagogy whose experiential logic mirrors its theoretical logic has not been designed, it has merely been explained.

**Decision:** The QUANTITATION sequence is the order in which a reader of the webtext comes to understand the full argument. The course design is the order in which a student comes to experience the principles the argument theorizes. The webtext should explicitly narrate this divergence as an instance of the decomposition principle it claims to theorize (see OQ1).
