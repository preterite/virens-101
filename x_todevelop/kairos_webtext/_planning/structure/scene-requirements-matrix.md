# Scene Requirements Matrix

This page provides an overview of what each scene MUST show, SHOULD plant, and COULD include. Use this for drafting planning and to track what's been accomplished.

---

## Quick Reference: Six Moves by Scene

| Move | Primary Scene | Secondary |
|------|---------------|-----------|
| **Capture** | G1 (W2) | V1 (envelope as capture) |
| **Classify** | V2 (W4-5) | V3 (audits show results) |
| **Route** | G2 (W5-6) | G3 (library parallel) |
| **Distill** | G3 (W8) | G5 (portfolio consolidation) |
| **Connect** | V4/G4 (W9) | V5 (analytics show patterns) |
| **Publish** | G6 (W15) | V6 (permission → ownership) |
