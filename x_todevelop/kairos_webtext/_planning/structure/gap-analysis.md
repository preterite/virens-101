# Gap Analysis: Development Narrative Concepts

## Underrepresented in Scene Structure

These concepts need Nexus page or prose treatment:

| Concept | Importance | Coverage Method |
|---------|------------|-----------------|
| Difficulty Pairs (Salvatori/Star, Meadows/Alexander) | HIGH | Nexus pages (Nyssa, Tsuga) |
| Corpse→Compost→Garden transformation | HIGH | Nexus page (Acer) + reference in G5, G6 |
| Movement Transition Reflections (W3, W8, W11-12) | HIGH | Prose explanation; W3/W12 vignettes |
| ONESIEs (systematic vocabulary introduction) | MEDIUM | Reference in V2 |
| Evidence-Based Reflection vs. Impressionistic | HIGH | Nexus page (Thuja) |
| Process Documentation Philosophy | MEDIUM | Reference in G3, G5 |

## Weeks Requiring Explanation (Not Narrated)

| Week | Key Content | Coverage Method |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| 3 | Salvatori; Compression; Dev log; First peer review; Literacy Narrative | Nexus (Nyssa) + vignette |
| 6 | SEAR methodology | Prose or fold into V2/G2 references |
| 12 | Selection as composition; Process Archaeology start | Nexus (Acer, Thuja) + vignette |
| 14 | Presentations | Brief mention in G6 |

## Concepts Well-Covered by Scenes

- Constraint sequencing (V1, V3, G3)
- BEAM framework (V2, G2)
- Six moves (distributed across all scenes)
- Infrastructure visibility (G3, V5)
- Permission/ownership transfer (V6, G6)
- Accumulation arc (G1 → G6)
