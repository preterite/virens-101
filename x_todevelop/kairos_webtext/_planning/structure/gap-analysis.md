# Gap Analysis: Development Narrative Concepts

## Underrepresented in Scene Structure

These concepts need Nexus page or prose treatment:

| Concept | Importance | Coverage Method |
|---------|------------|-----------------|
| Difficulty Pairs (Salvatori/Star, Meadows/Alexander) | HIGH | Nexus pages (Nyssa, Tsuga) |
| Corpse→Compost→Garden transformation | HIGH | Nexus page (Acer) + reference in G5, G6 |
| Movement Transition Reflections (W3, W8, W11-12) | HIGH | Prose explanation; W3/W12 vignettes |
| ONESIEs (systematic vocabulary introduction) | MEDIUM | Reference in V2 |
| Evidence-Based Reflection vs. Impressionistic | HIGH | Nexus page (Thuja) |
| Process Documentation Philosophy | MEDIUM | Reference in G3, G5 |

## Weeks Requiring Explanation (Not Narrated)

| Week | Key Content | Coverage Method |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| 3 | Salvatori; Compression; Dev log; First peer review; Literacy Narrative | Nexus (Nyssa) + vignette |
| 4-5 | SEAR introduction; Zotero setup; Meadows leverage points | Prose or fold into V2/G2 references (V2 now at Wk 6-7) |
| 12 | Selection as composition; Process Archaeology start | Nexus (Acer, Thuja) + vignette |
| 14 | Presentations | Brief mention in G6 |

## Circulation and Appropriation: Student-Facing Gaps (2026-02-12)

The QUANTITATION sequence mapping (see [[quantitation-course-sequence-mapping]]) identified that **circulation** (QUANTITATION position 10) and **appropriation** (position 11) are absent as named concepts in student-facing materials, despite being structurally present in the course design (six peer review cycles = circulation events; 50/50 formative-portfolio split = appropriation design).

**Decision:** Both concepts need student-facing introduction. Help students name what we're doing.

| Concept | Best Course Site | Webtext Representation | Action Needed |
|---------|-----------------|----------------------|---------------|
| **Circulation** | Week 13 (permission flags discussion; "publish" introduced as sixth move) | Illicium nexus (I₂) | Add circulation vocabulary to Week 13 student-facing synthesis; fold into permission flags treatment where texts enter circulation |
| **Appropriation** | Week 15 (reflective cover letter) or Week 9 (conference) | Olea nexus (O) | Add reflective question: "Who benefited from your writing labor this semester? In what forms?" to cover letter prompt or conference prep |
| **Labor-Capital Cycle** | Week 1 (course overview) | Quercus nexus (Q) | Mark economic vocabulary as deliberate and economic in course overview — one moment of naming, not frontloaded theory (denaturalization backflow B2) |

**Webtext action:** Add notes to relevant nexus page outlines (Illicium, Olea, Quercus) that the course now introduces these concepts to students. Update env.md's claim that "the course names its operations as economic" to reflect specific sites where this naming occurs.

## Concepts Well-Covered by Scenes

- Constraint sequencing (V1, V3, G3)
- BEAM framework (V2, G2)
- Six moves (distributed across all scenes)
- Infrastructure visibility (G3, V5)
- Permission/ownership transfer (V6, G6)
- Accumulation arc (G1 → G6)
