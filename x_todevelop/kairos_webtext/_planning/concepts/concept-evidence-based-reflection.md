# Concept: Evidence-Based Reflection

## The Problem

Traditional reflection is impressionistic: students report feelings about process without evidence. This creates unfalsifiable claims and misses patterns visible only in aggregate.

## The Alternative

Evidence-based reflection uses documented process as data source:
- Dev logs provide timeline
- Fragments provide corpus
- Eli Review provides peer interaction record
- Version history provides revision evidence
