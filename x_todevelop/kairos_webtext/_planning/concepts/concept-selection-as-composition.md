# Concept: Selection as Composition

## Core Claim

Selection is not pre-composition or post-composition but _is_ composition. The act of choosing what to include, exclude, sequence, and present constitutes a compositional act.

## Theoretical Grounding

<!-- Arrangement as rhetorical canon; curation literature -->

## Course Implementation

<!-- Portfolio selection process; Process Archaeology -->

## Connection to Accumulation Model

<!-- With enough accumulated material, selection becomes primary compositional act -->

## Draft Notes

<!-- Working notes -->
