# Concept: Difficulty Pairs

## The Pairing Principle

The webtext uses "difficulty pairs" — two readings that illuminate each other through shared concern with difficulty/resistance as informational.

## Pair A: Salvatori + Star

| Element | Salvatori | Star |
|---------|-----------|------|
| Nexus | Nyssa | Tsuga |
| Domain | Reading/interpretation | Infrastructure/systems |
| Difficulty reveals | Assumptions, reading strategies | System structure, dependencies |
| Course moment | W3 first difficult reading | W8 infrastructure recognition |

## Why Pairing Matters

<!-- Theoretical argument for pairing -->

## Other Potential Pairs

<!-- Meadows [[@meadows2008lever]]/Alexander [[@alexander1964notet]]? Others? -->
