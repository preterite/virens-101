# Concept: Quantitation as Rhetoric

**Nexus**: Illicium (Star [[@star1999ethnp]] Anise)

## Core Claim

Numbers in composition pedagogy are not anti-humanistic but rhetorical: they classify, compare, and route attention. The fear of quantitation reflects disciplinary anxiety, not inherent incompatibility.

## Villanueva's Argument

"Toward a political economy of rhetoric" — humanists' fear of numbers limits our ability to analyze material conditions of writing.

## Hayles's Contribution

"How We Read: Close, Hyper, Machine" — machine reading (including quantitative analysis) complements rather than replaces close reading.

## Course Implementation

- Eli Review analytics (V5)
- Fragment counts as progress indicator
- BEAM categorization as classification
- Numbers as "points for intervention"

## Meta-Application: QUANTITATION Puzzle

The article itself uses quantitation (12 trees, letter sequence) as organizing principle, demonstrating the rhetoric it argues for.
