# Concept: Archives Give You Analytics

**Nexus**: Thuja (Cedar)

## The Principle

"Archives give you analytics" — systematic documentation creates analyzable corpus. What students document becomes available for pattern recognition.

## Mechanism

1. Students document process (dev logs, fragments, peer reviews)
2. Documentation accumulates as archive
3. Archive becomes analyzable (by student, instructor, or tools)
4. Analysis reveals patterns invisible in moment
5. Patterns inform intervention and revision

## Hayles Connection

Machine reading as triage — not replacing human interpretation but enabling scale.

## Course Implementation

- Dev logs (2× weekly)
- Process Archaeology assignment
- Eli Review as peer interaction archive
- Portfolio as curated archive

## Key Insight

The same documentation that helps students track their work helps instructors see patterns across students (V5: Eli Review analytics).
