# Grant Miles

**Role**: Student track narrator  
**Name meaning**: Grant = permission, given; Miles = journey, distance traveled

## Background

- Filipino heritage (American-born father, Filipina mother)
- First-generation college student
- L1/L2 household (Tagalog at home, English dominant academically)
- Works 12-15 hours/week at campus library circulation desk
- Colonial dimension remains largely implicit

## Characteristics

- Intellectually capable but organizationally chaotic
- Struggles are executive function, time management, follow-through—not comprehension
- Smart but doesn't realize it; partially organized but thinks it's worse
- Characteristic teenager qualities: developmental narcissism, labor-saving desire for "easy answer"
- Phone addiction as material constraint

## Library Job Significance

- Works inside information system professionally (shelving, circulation, returns)
- Irony: routes other people's books efficiently while struggling with own fragments
- Physical location near exit and security sensors → constraint visibility
- Returns and reserves carts behind desk → filing/routing made visible
- Creates time pressure: can't do all homework because working

## Arc Across Scenes

| Scene | Week | Focus | Arc Beat |
|-------|------|-------|----------|
| G1 | 2 | Tech setup | Setup |
| G2 | 5-6 | Peer review | Struggles with feedback |
| G3 | 8 | "What You're Automating" | Recognizes infrastructure |
| G4 | 9 | Conference | Receives direction |
| G5 | 11 | M3 Milestone | Consolidates |
| G6 | 15 | Envelope opening | Reflects on transformation |

## Voice Notes

- First-person, present tense (immediacy)
- Casual but increasingly precise vocabulary
- Internal monologue reveals confusion → clarity arc
- Relatable frustrations

## Open Questions

1. How much of Filipino heritage surfaces explicitly vs. remains implicit resonance?
2. How does his library work create specific scene details?
3. What's his relationship with other students (study group? isolation?)
