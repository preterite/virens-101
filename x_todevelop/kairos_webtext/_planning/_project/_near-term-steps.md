# Near-Term Steps (Next 2-3 Sessions)

## Scholarly/Writing

1. Draft one complete scene as proof-of-concept (V1 or G3)
2. Draft one nexus page as proof-of-concept (Nyssa recommended)
3. Write W3 vignette (Grant's Salvatori [[@salvatori1996conve]] confusion)
4. Draft abstract (150-250 words) to force compression

## Development

5. Create 12 nexus placeholders with assigned concepts and scene connections
6. Map vignette placement to specific nexus pages
7. Set up Quartz for local preview during development
8. Scan 2-3 test ties to establish visual asset workflow

## Open Questions to Resolve

- How much of Grant's Filipino heritage surfaces explicitly?
- Does Vera break the fourth wall?
- Recommended reading order vs. fully open navigation?
- Toggle between Vera/Grant views of W9 conference?
