# === ARGUMENT ARCHITECTURE ===
central-claim: "Constraint sequencing—the deliberate design of when constraints arrive in a writing course—offers a theoretical framework that recovers process pedagogy's attention to individual learners while integrating systems thinking's attention to social and material infrastructure, dissolving the writer/social binary that has organized composition's disciplinary debates."
secondary-claims:
  - "Machine delegation of administrative constraints (YAML, templates, tags) frees human attention for rhetorical constraints that require judgment, making visible which constraints are delegable."
  - "Systems thinking reveals what 'social' and 'writer' pedagogies share: transformation over time through sequenced constraint."
  - "Textual accumulation (corpus-building) rather than discrete assignment completion reframes writing labor as transformation over time—how process becomes product, how labor becomes capital."
  - "YOLO up, constrain down is a method for constraint sequencing that makes explicit what Elbow's generative pedagogy always implied: generation precedes evaluation because it creates material for social feedback to act upon."

## Central Argument

### One-sentence claim

Constraint sequencing—designing _when_ constraints arrive in a writing course and _what_ handles them (human judgment vs. machine process)—offers a theoretical framework that recovers process pedagogy's attention to individual learners while integrating systems thinking's attention to social and material infrastructure.

### Expanded abstract (150-250 words)

Composition's "social turn" corrected expressivist pedagogy's apparent individualism but backgrounded attention to the student as locus of transformation over time. This webtext proposes _constraint sequencing_ as a framework that dissolves the writer/social binary by showing how both operate through constraint arrival across a semester-long accumulation arc.

Drawing on the VIRENS 101 course design—a first-year composition course integrating composition pedagogy with systems thinking—the piece demonstrates how deliberate design of constraint timing (when requirements arrive) and constraint delegation (what machines vs. humans handle) creates conditions for student capital formation. The "corpse → compost → garden" transformation arc makes visible how writing labor becomes intellectual capital through textual accumulation.

The argument recovers Peter Elbow's generative pedagogy by showing that "generate first, evaluate later" was always implicitly social: freewriting creates material for social feedback to act upon. Systems thinking—specifically infrastructure studies (Star [[@star1999ethnp]]), design theory (Alexander [[@alexander1964notet]]), and systems dynamics (Meadows [[@meadows2008lever]])—reveals the mechanism: constraints are socially sourced but individually encountered over time.

The webtext offers parallel navigation paths for readers (designer chronology / learner chronology) that converge at key transformation nodes, demonstrating in its form the argument about temporal design. Course materials are offered for adaptation, positioning this as both theoretical contribution and practical resource.

### So-what test

**For composition scholars**: A way past the process/post-process/social impasse that recovers attention to individual learners without abandoning systemic critique.

**For composition instructors**: A framework for designing courses as "constraint sequences" rather than "assignment sequences," with concrete tools (templates, infrastructure) for implementation.

**For the discipline**: An argument that systems thinking is composition's missing framework—not replacing existing theories but revealing connections between them.

## Key Decisions from Initial Ideation (2026-01-24)

### Venue Decision: Kairos "Inventio"

**Rationale**:
- The 169-file vault structure _is_ the argument, not just evidence; Kairos's webtextual affordances let readers navigate it
- Dual-track architecture (content/justification) maps onto layered navigation
- The economic vocabulary is speculative; Kairos tolerates exploratory-yet-rigorous work
- Process documentation is performative; readers can see it in motion
- No empirical evidence yet; "Inventio" frames this appropriately as work-in-progress

**What College English would require** (backup venue):
- Tighter central claim
- Substantial literature review positioning
- Student outcome evidence
- Economic framing relegated to framework

### Structural Decision: Hybrid

**Structure 3's argument** (transformation problem as through-line) + **Structure 2's form** (parallel designer/learner chronologies with convergence points)

**Entry points** for different reader orientations:
1. Network diagram — systems thinkers see interconnection
2. Parallel timelines — temporal thinkers see constraint arrival
3. Tables/Gantt charts — resource thinkers see labor/capital allocation

**Convergence nodes** where all paths meet:
- Week 1 / Stage 1: envelope exercise
- Week 6 / Stage 7: compost stage  
- Week 15 / Stage 9: portfolio as capital

### Theoretical Positioning

**Elbow recovery** (late Elbow specifically):
- The "social turn" critiques treated expressivist pedagogy as naive individualism
- But Elbow's actual practice was always social: freewriting creates _shareable_ material; peer response _is_ audience internalization
- Constraint sequencing reveals the social mechanism implicit in Elbowian practice: generation precedes evaluation because P blocks (peer review) are the constraint-introduction mechanism

**Salvatori [[@salvatori1996conve]] recovery**:
- "Conversations with Texts" insists difficulty is informational for _this learner at this moment_
- "Difficulty-as-diagnostic" principle is pure Salvatori
- Both Elbow and Salvatori attend to individual learners without being anti-social

**Systems thinking as integrative framework**:
- Not replacing social-epistemic or expressivist or post-process
- Revealing what they share: transformation over time through sequenced constraint
- Composition hasn't adequately integrated systems thinking; this article argues it should

### Labor/Capital Framing

**Not Inoue's [[@inoue2019labos]] labor-contract model** (which is about valuing labor fairly):
- This asks a different question: how does writing-labor become writing-capital over time?
- The transformation problem as _method_: Marx's great achievement is temporal analysis of transformation
- Don't need to resolve the mathematics; need to _name_ the question
- Position as _complementary_ to Inoue, not corrective

**Dropped**: Foley's [[@foley2000recen]] mathematical apparatus. Use the conceptual moves without the equations.

### Failure Modes Node

**Must include**: A node or nexus addressing failure modes for machine/process delegation:
- When does YAML frontmatter become its own cognitive burden?
- When do templates constrain what students can think?
- Preempts techno-solutionism critique

### Audience

**Primary**: Composition scholars who study pedagogy theoretically<br/>
**Secondary**: Composition instructors who might adopt/adapt practices

### Minor Implications

The article should gesture toward:
- "Here's why Marx's Capital v1 and v2 are worth reading for compositionists" (method, not doctrine)
- "Where do we stand now re: process pedagogy after post-process?" 
- "How can we articulate relations between 'process' and 'labor' more clearly?"

## Argument Architecture

### Problem/Exigence

Composition's attention to "the social" has directed disciplinary focus toward students as groups/classes of people rather than individual learners. The "erasure of the student" (Salvatori & Donahue's phrase) means losing sight of granular, moment-to-moment composing practices. Meanwhile, "process pedagogy" has been critiqued (post-process) and never adequately theorized in relation to technological affordances (machine constraint delegation).

### Theoretical Framework

**Constraint sequencing** as the organizing concept:
- When do constraints arrive? (temporal design)
- Who/what enforces them? (human judgment vs. machine process)
- How does constraint arrival shape transformation? (labor → capital)

**Supporting frameworks**:
- Infrastructure studies (Star): good infrastructure absorbs constraint
- Design theory (Alexander): misfit detection, constraint decomposition
- Systems dynamics (Meadows): leverage points, transformation over time
- Process pedagogy (Elbow, Perl [[@perl1979compp]], Sommers): recovered and systematized

### Evidence/Demonstration

- VIRENS 101 course materials (169 files) as design artifact
- Dual narrative (development / learning) showing designer and student perspectives
- Vault structure itself demonstrates systems thinking approach
- **Not yet available**: Student work, pilot data (Fall 2026)

### Implications

- Composition pedagogy as _temporal design_: we design when constraints arrive
- Systems thinking as composition's missing integrative framework
- Recovery of attention to individual learners without abandoning systemic critique
- Practical tools for instructors designing courses as constraint sequences

## Structural Design

### Organizational Model

Hybrid: argumentative spine with multiple navigation paths

### Main Path (Structure 3 argument)

| Section | Function | Key Content |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| 1. Entry | Frame the transformation problem | How does writing-process become writing-product? Composition's implicit question. |
| 2. Standard answer | Process pedagogy's limits | Revision transforms drafts. But what about accumulation? |
| 3. Accumulation reframe | Textual accumulation model | Transformation across corpus, not within draft. Fragment model. |
| 4. Sequencing mechanism | Constraint sequencing | When constraints arrive shapes transformation. Elbow recovered. YOLO up, constrain down. |
| 5. Delegation question | Machine vs. human constraints | Infrastructure studies. Which constraints should machines handle? Failure modes. |
| 6. Demonstration | VIRENS 101 walkthrough | Corpse → compost → garden arc. Constraint sequencing in action. |
| 7. Claim | Systems thinking integration | What "social" and "writer" pedagogies share. Transformation over time through sequenced constraint. |
| 8. Exit | Invitation | Course materials for adaptation. Theoretical framework for adoption. |

### Alternative Navigation (Structure 2 form)

**Track A: Designer chronology** — Stages 1-9, rationale documents linked<br/>
**Track B: Student chronology** — Weeks 1-15, course materials linked<br/>
**Convergence points** where tracks illuminate each other

### Entry Points

1. **Network diagram**: Big hairy clickable map of course components and dependencies
2. **Parallel timelines**: Designer track / Student track side-by-side
3. **Resource tables**: Block allocations, fragment quotas, Gantt-style progression

## Interlocutors & Positioning

### Primary Conversation Partners

| Scholar | Key Text | Relation |
|---------|----------|----------|
| Elbow (late) | _Vernacular Eloquence_; "The Believing Game" | Recovering: showing his pedagogy was always social |
| Salvatori | "Conversations with Texts" | Building on: difficulty-as-diagnostic, interconnection of reading/writing |
| Sommers | "Revision Strategies" | Extending: from revision-within-draft to transformation-across-corpus |
| Star | "Ethnography of Infrastructure" | Applying: infrastructure absorbs constraint |
| Alexander | _Notes on the Synthesis of Form_ | Applying: misfit detection, constraint decomposition |
| Meadows | "Leverage Points" | Applying: systems dynamics to pedagogy |
| Inoue | labor-based grading work | Complementing (not challenging): different question about labor |

### Anticipated Objections

| Objection | Response Strategy |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Techno-solutionism | Failure modes node; technology enables visibility, doesn't solve problems |
| Ignores social justice concerns | Systems thinking _includes_ social constraint; doesn't erase systemic critique |
| Just another process model | No: designed temporality, not natural stages; post-post-process position |
| No evidence | Acknowledged; Inventio framing; invitation to test |
| Marx is overkill | Method, not doctrine; transformation question, not labor theory apparatus |

## Development Tracking

### Conversation History

| Date | Context Note | Key Decisions |
|------|--------------|---------------|
| 2026-01-24 | [[600_teaching/virens_101/x_todevelop/kairos_webtext/_planning/_project/_article-assumptions]] | Venue (Kairos), structure (hybrid), interlocutors, framing |

### Current Priorities

- [ ] Develop Section 1 (Entry/framing) as test of argumentative spine
- [ ] Sketch network diagram mockup for entry-point visualization
- [ ] Identify 3-4 course materials to foreground as demonstration examples
- [ ] Draft "failure modes" node content

### Open Questions

- How much of the vault to make downloadable/adaptable?
- Should parallel timelines be visual (interactive) or textual (linked)?
- How to handle the Marx framing without derailing into political economy?
- What's the right level of Elbow recovery (early vs. late work distinction)?

### Parking Lot

- Citation-as-dependency could be its own Computers and Composition piece
- The "post-post-process" naming might be worth developing or might be distracting
- Connection to threshold concepts literature (Adler-Kassner [[@adler-kassner2015namin]], Wardle [[@downs2007teaci]]) — defer for now
- Connection to transfer research (Yancey [[@yancey1998refle]], Nowacek) — defer for now
