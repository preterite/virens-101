# Kairos Webtext — Reading Tracker

## Purpose

This tracker prioritizes readings needed for the **webtext** — the scholarly apparatus, nexus pages, and framing sections — not the course design (documented separately in `*-reasons-v101.md` files). Readings here serve the argument VIRENS 101 makes to composition studies, not the pedagogy it enacts for students.

## Priority Key

- 🔴 **Critical** — nexus page or env argument depends on this source
- 🟡 **Important** — strengthens argument or fills disciplinary gap
- 🟢 **Supplementary** — useful context, comparison, or extension
- ⚪ **Verify** — needs location or confirmation before reading
- ✅ Read/Engaged | 📖 In progress | ⬜ Not yet started

## Nexus Key

| Code | Tree | Concept |
|------|------|---------|
| Q | Quercus | Writing as Labor/Capital |
| U | Ulmus | Six Moves vs. Writing Process |
| A₁ | Acer | Economy and Technology in Composition |
| N₁ | Nerium | Textual Accumulation + Archives Give Analytics |
| T₁ | Taxus | YOLO Up, Constrain Down |
| I₁ | Ilex | Infrastructure Visibility + Difficulty-as-Diagnostic |
| T₂ | Thuja | Permission Flags |
| A₂ | Alnus | Constraint Sequencing |
| T₃ | Tsuga | Citation as Dependency |
| I₂ | Illicium | Circulation |
| O | Olea | Appropriation and Value |
| N₂ | Nyssa | Corpse, Compost, Garden |
| env | — | Denaturalization as Method (supporting page) |

## Tier 1: Argument-Shaping

These directly shape the webtext's central claims. Sequenced by dependency: env framing first, then nexus pages in QUANTITATION order.

| # | Source | Priority | Status | Nexus | Relevance |
|---|--------|----------|--------|-------|-----------|
| 1 | **Edwards**, "Economies of Writing, Without the Economics" (_Rhetoric Review_ 33.3, 2014) [[@edwards2014econo]] | 🔴 | ✅ | Q, A₁, env | Author's own foundational economic frame. Definition of economic activity as appropriation of value at any stage in the cycle. Gibson-Graham, Resnick/Wolff, Trimbur, Horner synthesis. The webtext extends and operationalizes this article's theoretical apparatus. Self-cite throughout. |
| 2 | **Edwards**, "Unpacking the Digital" (_Computers and Composition_ 40, 2016) [[@edwards2016unpac]] | 🔴 | ✅ | Q, A₁, I₁ | Author's own. Labor/capital circuits in digital composition. Reading as productive consumption. The digital as economic transformation, not medium shift. Grounds the experience-goods move in composition-specific terms. |
| 3 | **Gibson-Graham**, _A Postcapitalist Politics_ (2006) [[@gibson-graham2006postc]] | 🔴 | ✅ | Q, O, env | Diverse economies framework. Non-capitalist production is still production. Classroom as non-market economic site. Primary theoretical authority for the core claim that writing-as-economic-activity is literal, not metaphorical. Engaged in Edwards 2014; needs fresh engagement for the webtext's specific claims about student self-appropriation. |
| 4 | **Trimbur**, "Composition and the Circulation of Writing" (_CCC_ 52.2, 2000) [[@trimbur2000compp]] | 🔴 | ✅ | I₂, O, Q | Circulation as delivery; writing's movement through social spaces. Load-bearing for Illicium (circulation) and Olea (appropriation). The webtext's cycle framework (production-distribution-use-reproduction) builds from Trimbur. Already engaged; needs nexus-specific re-reading for how circulation shapes writing at every stage, not only post-production. |
| 5 | **Horner**, _Terms of Work for Composition_ (2000) [[@horner2000terms]] | 🔴 | ✅ | Q, A₁ | Labor/work distinction; material conditions. Primary disciplinary authority for taking economic vocabulary literally in composition. Paired with Trimbur as the two scholars the webtext most directly extends. |
| 6 | **Salvatori**, "Conversations with Texts" (_CE_ 58.4, 1996) [[@salvatori1996conve]] | 🔴 | ✅ | N₂, I₁, A₂ | Reading as activation; difficulty as diagnostic; three-entry notebook. Central to Nyssa (difficulty) and Ilex (infrastructure visibility through breakdown). The webtext's experience-goods framework gives Salvatori's pedagogy an economic rationale she didn't provide. Re-read specifically for how her method makes reading labor visible. |
| 7 | **Babbage**, _On the Economy of Machinery and Manufactures_ (1832) | 🔴 | ⬜ | env, Q | Division of mental labor; extraction of skill into procedure; the line between "requires skill" and "delegable" is always movable. Load-bearing for env's historical trajectory. Needs targeted reading: chapters on division of labor and the "Babbage principle" specifically. Not the whole book. |
| 8 | **Bain**, _English Composition and Rhetoric_ (1866) or secondary source on modes | 🔴 | ⬜ | env, U | Modes of discourse as managerial technology. The env argument claims Bain's modes carry economic rationality into pedagogy. Needs at minimum a strong secondary account — Robert Connors' "The Rise and Fall of the Modes of Discourse" (_CCC_ 32.4, 1981) may suffice. |
| 9 | **Inoue**, _Labor-Based Grading Contracts_ (2019) or "Classroom Writing Assessment as an Antiracist Practice" (_Pedagogy_ 14.3, 2014) | 🔴 | ⬜ | Q, env | The Quercus draft positions the webtext against Inoue's Smithian equivalence (labor time = value). This critique must be precise and fair. Needs substantive reading to ensure the counter-argument engages what Inoue actually claims rather than a straw version. Most important single reading for disciplinary positioning. |
| 10 | **Arrow**, "The Economic Implications of Learning by Doing" (_Review of Economic Studies_, 1962) | 🔴 | ⬜ | Q | Productivity gains from experience of production itself. Grounds the experience-goods claim in economics-native terms. Already cited in Quercus draft; needs actual reading to verify the argument tracks. Short article. |
| 11 | **Nelson**, "Information and Consumer Behavior" (_Journal of Political Economy_ 78.2, 1970) | 🔴 | ⬜ | Q, env | Search goods vs. experience goods taxonomy. Foundational for the webtext's central economic distinction. The env `endif` argument and the Quercus experience-goods section both depend on this category having economic authority. Short article; essential. |
| 12 | **Star**, "The Ethnography of Infrastructure" (_American Behavioral Scientist_ 43.3, 1999) | 🔴 | ✅ | I₁, T₃ | Infrastructure visible upon breakdown. Central to Ilex. Already engaged in course design; needs nexus-specific re-reading for how infrastructure visibility connects to difficulty-as-diagnostic and citation-as-dependency. |
| 13 | **Kline**, "What Is Technology?" (_Technology and Culture_ 51.3, 2010) | 🔴 | ⬜ | A₁, env | Technology as substitution of capital for labor. The env draft references this definition; Acer (economy and technology) depends on it entirely. The webtext's syllogism — writing is a technology; technologies are economic; therefore writing is economic — runs through Kline. |
| 14 | **Elbow**, _Writing Without Teachers_ (1973) or "Closing My Eyes as I Speak" (1987) | 🔴 | ✅ | T₁, U | Generative pedagogy recovered against social-turn critiques. Taxus (YOLO up) positions Elbow's freewriting as structurally rather than expressively rational. Ulmus (six moves vs. process) needs Elbow as the process-pedagogy figure being extended, not replaced. |
| 15 | **Beecher**, _A Treatise on Domestic Economy_ (1841) or secondary on Beecher's educational rationalization | 🟡 | ⬜ | env | Rationalization of domestic and educational labor. The env argument positions Beecher between Babbage and Bain. A strong secondary account may suffice — Kathryn Kish Sklar's biography or relevant chapters from histories of American education. Less critical than Babbage and Bain because the claim about Beecher is narrower. |

## Tier 2: Theoretical Framing and Disciplinary Positioning

These provide conceptual apparatus, disciplinary positioning, and strengthened authority. Sequenced by significance to the webtext as currently architected.

| # | Source | Priority | Status | Nexus | Relevance |
|---|--------|----------|--------|-------|-----------|
| 1 | **Resnick & Wolff**, _Knowledge and Class_ (1987) [[@resnick1987knowl]] | 🟡 | ⬜ | Q, O | Overdetermined class analysis; surplus labor. Gibson-Graham's theoretical foundation. The webtext's appropriation argument (Olea) depends on Resnick/Wolff's framework of multiple points of surplus appropriation. Targeted reading of class-process chapters, not the whole book. |
| 2 | **Baumol**, "Macroeconomics of Unbalanced Growth" (_AER_ 57.3, 1967) | 🟡 | ⬜ | Q, A₁ | Cost disease: sectors whose output depends on irreducible human labor face structurally rising costs. Explains why institutional pressure to reduce composition costs = pressure to destroy value-creation mechanism. Already cited in Quercus draft; needs actual reading. Short article. |
| 3 | **Connors**, "The Rise and Fall of the Modes of Discourse" (_CCC_ 32.4, 1981) | 🟡 | ⬜ | env, U | May serve as sufficient secondary source for Bain's modes. Historicizes the modes as institutional technology. If Connors gives the argument what it needs, direct Bain reading becomes supplementary. |
| 4 | **Perl**, "Understanding Composing" (_CCC_ 31.4, 1980) | 🟡 | ✅ | T₁, A₂ | Felt sense; recursive composing. Quercus draft links Arrow to Perl ("Arrow gives an economics-native way of saying what Perl says phenomenologically"). Needs verification that the parallel holds on re-reading. Already engaged. |
| 5 | **Shapiro & Varian**, _Information Rules_ (1999) | 🟡 | ⬜ | Q, A₁ | Information goods as inherently experience goods. Extends Nelson into digital context. Strengthens the claim that institutional metrics systematically fail because they were designed for search goods. Targeted reading of experience-goods chapters. |
| 6 | **Darby & Karni**, "Free Competition and the Optimal Amount of Fraud" (1973) | 🟡 | ⬜ | Q, I₁ | Tripartite taxonomy: search / experience / credence goods. Credence goods = quality unassessable even after consumption. The contrast case: composition produces experience goods (assessable retrospectively), not credence goods (never assessable). Precision matters for disciplinary skeptics. |
| 7 | **Watkins**, _Work Time_ (1989) [[@watkins2009work]] | 🟡 | ⬜ | Q, I₂ | English departments and the circulation of cultural value. Directly relevant to the appropriation and circulation arguments. One of the few scholars who has done economic analysis of English studies without retreating to metaphor. |
| 8 | **Watkins**, "Just Choose" (_JAC_, 2007) [[@watkins2006just]] | 🟡 | ⬜ | Q, O | Derivative relations in literacy. Extends the Watkins engagement toward how value circulates in literacy instruction specifically. |
| 9 | **Alexander**, _Notes on the Synthesis of Form_ (1964) | 🟡 | ✅ | A₂, T₂ | Pattern language; constraint analysis in design. Grounds constraint sequencing and permission flags in design theory rather than pedagogy alone. Already engaged in course design; needs nexus-level re-reading for what Alexander says about _temporal_ design — when constraints arrive. |
| 10 | **Meadows**, _Thinking in Systems_ (2008) | 🟡 | ✅ | A₂, I₁ | Systems dynamics; leverage points; feedback loops. Already engaged. Needs targeted re-reading for how leverage points theory maps onto constraint sequencing — which interventions have disproportionate effects and why. |
| 11 | **Galloway**, _Protocol_ (2004) [[@galloway2004prot]] | 🟡 | ✅ | T₂, T₃ | Internet architecture as control through protocol. Permission flags and citation-as-dependency both draw on Galloway's framework of distributed control. Already engaged; verify that the permission-flags nexus page uses Galloway correctly. |
| 12 | **Bridle**, _New Dark Age_ (2018/2023) [[@bridle2023dark]] | 🟡 | ✅ | I₁, A₁ | Epistemological condition of technological opacity. Establishes the "New Dark Age" information environment that VIRENS 101 claims to address. Already engaged in fragments; needs nexus-level reading for how Bridle's argument about computational opacity connects to infrastructure visibility. |
| 13 | **Scott**, _Dangerous Writing_ (2009) | 🟡 | ⬜ | Q, O | Political economy of composition instruction. Direct disciplinary predecessor. Scott and Horner are the two composition scholars who have taken political economy most seriously. Needs reading to position the webtext relative to Scott's argument — extending it? correcting it? |
| 14 | **Villanueva**, "Toward a Political Economy of Rhetoric" (2005) [[@villanueva2005towar]] | 🟡 | ✅ | Q, env | "Fear numbers." Names the discipline's resistance to economic analysis. The webtext responds to this resistance directly. Already engaged; useful as epigraphic and positioning source. |
| 15 | **Hayles**, "How We Read: Close, Hyper, Machine" (_ADE Bulletin_, 2010) [[@hayles2010read:]] | 🟡 | ⬜ | I₁, N₁ | Tripartite reading taxonomy. If reading constitutes meaning (experience good), what happens when reading is delegated? Relevant to the AI/machine delegation thread in the webtext. |
| 16 | **Foley**, "Recent Rethinking of Labor" (2000) [[@foley2000recen]] | 🟡 | ⬜ | Q | Labor chapter relevant to the distinction between labor-as-time and labor-as-transformation. Strengthens the critique of Inoue's Smithian equivalence. |
| 17 | **Flower & Hayes**, "A Cognitive Process Theory of Writing" (_CCC_ 32.4, 1981) | 🟡 | ✅ | U, T₁ | Foundation of process pedagogy. Ulmus page needs Flower & Hayes as the framework being extended/revised by the six-moves vocabulary. The webtext's claim is that process describes _when_; six moves describes _what_. Verify this reading holds. |
| 18 | **Miller**, "Genre as Social Action" (_QJS_ 70.2, 1984) [[@miller1984genrf]] | 🟡 | ⬜ | T₂, I₂ | Genre theory as social action. Permission flags and circulation both operate within genre constraints. The webtext needs to acknowledge genre theory as a conversation partner without getting absorbed by it — cite and distinguish. |

## Tier 3: Background, Extensions, Comparisons

| # | Source | Priority | Status | Nexus | Relevance |
|---|--------|----------|--------|-------|-----------|
| 1 | **Brandt**, _The Rise of Writing_ (2015) | 🟢 | ⬜ | Q, A₁ | Writing as labor in mass literacy economy. Relevant context but not load-bearing. Note: library.bib has only _Literacy in American Lives_ (2001); this needs its own entry. |
| 2 | **Braverman**, _Labor and Monopoly Capital_ (1974) | 🟢 | ⬜ | env, Q | Labor process theory; deskilling. Historical frame for how skill extraction operates. Strengthens env's Babbage-to-Bain trajectory but not necessary if Babbage is read directly. |
| 3 | **Stiegler**, _Technics and Time, Vol. 1_ (1998) | 🟢 | ⬜ | A₁, A₂ | Technology as constitutive of human temporality. Provides philosophical grounding for constraint sequencing's temporal claims. Deep background; cite if engaging temporality philosophically, skip if staying in economic register. |
| 4 | **Arendt**, _The Human Condition_ (1998) | 🟢 | ⬜ | Q | Labor/work/action distinction. Alternative to Marx's labor theory. Useful contrast case but risks opening a philosophical debate the webtext doesn't need. Cite only if distinguishing labor (consumed) from work (endures) maps cleanly onto experience goods. |
| 5 | **Hyde**, _The Gift_ (1983) | 🟢 | ⬜ | O, I₂ | Gift economy; creative work circulation. Relevant to Olea's appropriation argument — gift as one mode of value circulation alongside market and institutional capture. |
| 6 | **Strickland**, _The Managerial Unconscious_ (2011) | 🟢 | ⬜ | env, T₂ | Management discourse in composition. Strengthens env's claim about institutional decomposition serving administrative interests. Permission flags page could engage Strickland on who controls constraints. |
| 7 | **Adam**, _Timewatch_ (1995) | 🟢 | ⬜ | A₂ | Social construction of time. Background for constraint sequencing's temporal design claims. Not necessary if the argument stays in pedagogical rather than sociological register. |
| 8 | **Ong**, _Orality and Literacy_ (1982) | 🟢 | ✅ | A₁ | Writing restructures consciousness. Classic technology-of-writing argument. Already engaged; useful reference point for the syllogism (writing = technology = economic). |
| 9 | **Selber**, _Multiliteracies for a Digital Age_ (2004) | 🟢 | ✅ | I₁, T₂ | Functional, critical, rhetorical literacies framework. Already engaged in course design. Cite for infrastructure visibility if connecting digital literacy to economic visibility. |
| 10 | **Schön**, _The Reflective Practitioner_ (1983) | 🟢 | ✅ | N₁, I₁ | Reflection-in-action; knowing more than we can say. Already engaged. Relevant to archives-give-analytics (Nerium) — the accumulated record enables reflection that real-time practice can't. |
| 11 | **Beaufort**, _College Writing and Beyond_ (2007) [[@beaufort2007colle]] | 🟢 | ⬜ | N₁, I₂ | Transfer research. Relevant if the webtext claims that accumulated textual capital transfers beyond the course. Cite cautiously — transfer claims need evidence the webtext may not have. |
| 12 | **Yancey**, _Reflection in the Writing Classroom_ (1998) [[@yancey1998refle]] | 🟢 | ✅ | N₁ | Reflection and portfolio pedagogy. Relevant to textual accumulation (Nerium) as the existing disciplinary framework closest to what VIRENS 101 does with fragments. Cite to position the fragment model against portfolio tradition. |
| 13 | **Adler-Kassner & Wardle**, _Naming What We Know_ (2015) [[@adler-kassner2015namin]] | 🟢 | ⬜ | general | Threshold concepts in writing studies. Useful for disciplinary positioning — the webtext's vocabulary (six moves, constraint sequencing) could be read as proposing threshold concepts, though the economic frame resists that genre. Cite for context, not adoption. |
| 14 | **Downs & Wardle**, "Teaching about Writing, Righting Misconceptions" (_CCC_ 58.4, 2007) [[@downs2007teaci]] | 🟢 | ⬜ | U | Writing About Writing pedagogy. VIRENS 101's six-moves vocabulary is closer to WAW than to traditional process pedagogy. Acknowledge as conversation partner in Ulmus. |
| 15 | **Ostrom**, _Governing the Commons_ (1990) | 🟢 | ⬜ | O, N₁ | Commons governance through community-designed rules. Student corpus as commons. Connects to fragment accumulation and appropriation questions. Extension, not foundation. |
| 16 | **Folbre**, _The Invisible Heart_ (2001) | 🟢 | ⬜ | Q, O | Care labor systematically undervalued; value accrues to recipients rather than producers. Near-exact parallel to composition labor. Powerful footnote for the institutional appropriation argument. |
| 17 | **Polanyi**, _The Great Transformation_ (1944) | 🟢 | ⬜ | Q, env | Fictitious commodities. Student writing graded/assessed/exchanged for credit though not produced for market exchange — category error. Credit hours as fictitious commodities. Extension of env's commensuration argument. |

## Kairos-Specific: Digital Rhetoric and Webtext Precedents

Sources relevant to the _venue_ and _medium_ — how webtexts work, what Kairos audiences expect, and digital rhetoric scholarship the webtext should acknowledge.

| # | Source | Priority | Status | Relevance |
|---|--------|----------|--------|-----------|
| 1 | **Ball**, "Show, Not Tell: The Value of New Media Scholarship" (_Computers and Composition_ 21.4, 2004) | 🟡 | ⬜ | Foundational Kairos editorial statement on what webtexts can do that print can't. Necessary for the webtext's spec page and self-positioning. |
| 2 | **Eyman**, _Digital Rhetoric_ (2015, U of Michigan Press / digitalculturebooks) | 🟢 | ⬜ | Survey of the field the webtext operates in. Useful for positioning but not argument-shaping. |
| 3 | **Stolley**, "The Lo-Fi Manifesto" (_Kairos_ 12.3, 2008) | 🟢 | ⬜ | Brutalist aesthetics precedent in Kairos. Resonates with the webtext's design philosophy of visible infrastructure. |
| 4 | **Brooke**, _Lingua Fracta_ (2009) | 🟢 | ⬜ | New media canons of rhetoric. Potentially relevant to how the webtext reimagines arrangement and delivery through nexus structure. |
| 5 | Notable Kairos webtexts as structural models | 🟡 | ⬜ | Survey 3–5 recent webtexts for navigation patterns, apparatus conventions, and audience expectations. Inform manifest and init design. |

## Nexus-to-Source Dependency Map

Which sources are required before each nexus page can be drafted?

| Nexus | Must Read | Should Read | Already Engaged |
|-------|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| **env** | Babbage, Bain/Connors, Inoue, Kline | Beecher, Braverman | Edwards ×2, Gibson-Graham |
| **Q (Quercus)** | Nelson, Arrow, Inoue | Baumol, Darby & Karni, Foley | Edwards ×2, Gibson-Graham, Horner, Trimbur, Perl |
| **U (Ulmus)** | Connors (modes) | Downs & Wardle | Elbow, Flower & Hayes, Perl |
| **A₁ (Acer)** | Kline | Shapiro & Varian, Brandt | Edwards ×2, Ong |
| **N₁ (Nerium)** | — | Yancey, Beaufort | Schön, Salvatori |
| **T₁ (Taxus)** | — | — | Elbow, Alexander, Perl |
| **I₁ (Ilex)** | — | Hayles, Bridle fresh reading | Star, Salvatori, Meadows |
| **T₂ (Thuja)** | — | Strickland, Miller | Galloway, Alexander |
| **A₂ (Alnus)** | — | — | Alexander, Meadows, Perl, Salvatori |
| **T₃ (Tsuga)** | — | — | Star, Galloway |
| **I₂ (Illicium)** | Watkins _Work Time_ | Miller | Trimbur |
| **O (Olea)** | Resnick & Wolff (targeted) | Hyde, Folbre, Ostrom | Gibson-Graham, Trimbur |
| **N₂ (Nyssa)** | — | — | Salvatori |

**Key finding:** Q and env have the heaviest reading load. Nexus pages in positions 5–9 (Taxus through Tsuga) can be drafted primarily from already-engaged sources plus the reasons files. This suggests a drafting sequence: write the middle nexus pages while doing the reading for Q and env refinement.

## Possible Additional Sources (Not Yet Committed)

| Source | Nexus | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Pasquinelli, _Eye of the Master_ (2023) | A₁, I₁ | Machine delegation of labor. Recommended in prior sessions; needs assessment for webtext specifically. |
| Han, _Psychopolitics_ (2017) | T₂, O | Neoliberal control through self-exploitation. Potentially relevant to permission flags and appropriation. |
| Elson, _Value: The Representation of Labour in Capitalism_ (1979) | Q | Labor representation. Recommended in prior sessions; needs assessment. |
| Mazzucato, _The Value of Everything_ (2018) | Q, O | Value creation vs. value extraction. Potentially useful for the appropriation argument. |
