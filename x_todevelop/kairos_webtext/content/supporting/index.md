# index

<!-- 
INDEX PAGE FUNCTION:
A literary index in the Nabokovian tradition — not a homepage, not a 
table of contents, but an alphabetical finding aid that reveals the 
webtext's concerns through the act of indexing them. The index IS 
an argument about what the webtext contains, organized by what its 
author considers worth finding.

Entries should cross-reference, accumulate, and occasionally subvert.
Some entries point to content that exists. Some point to absences.
The index is a late-stage deliverable; it cannot be written until 
the content it indexes exists.
