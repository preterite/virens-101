# The Garden Tended / The Monster Zoo

> When you put bits and pieces of language together you get more than the sum of the parts, the process resembling Dr. Frankenstein's stitching together pieces of flesh and engendering not dead matter ... but a new kind of human being and a being in its own right.<br/>
> — Charles Bernstein, "Blood on the Cutting Room Floor"

## Teratology

The study of monsters is a study of seams. Every creature in this bestiary is assembled, returned, or transformed — made from what was and isn't anymore, or from what shouldn't be alive and is. Teratology asks whether we fear what we might become or what might arrive from outside us, and the answer, when the question is honest, is that the distinction doesn't hold. The monster is the moment the line between self-deformation and the Other dissolves. Something you made stops being yours. Something that was dead starts moving. The seam between the part and the whole opens, and what comes through is neither.

Composition pedagogy has its own teratology, though it rarely names it. The fear that writing can happen without a writer intending it. The fear that fragments assembled under constraint will produce something the student doesn't recognize as their own. The fear that what emerges from decomposition won't be an essay but something else — malformed, ungovernable, alive in the wrong way. These fears are structural, not psychological. They describe what happens when parts retain their autonomy inside a whole that was never preconceived.

Charles Bernstein names the reversal that organizes this bestiary: "What made Dr. Frankenstein's creature a monster was the reverse — starting with a preconceived whole and tailoring the parts to fit." The creature assembled from parts, allowed to find its own fusion, is the poem. The monster is produced by the blueprint.

The rubric is Frankenstein.

## The Vampire (No Season)

The vampire has no calendar. Surplus-value extraction is not seasonal.

The vampire drains what others produce. It is intentional where other monsters are structural — not the friction of value lost in circulation but the deliberate siphoning of labor's product by someone else's appetite. The vampire hypnotizes its victims into compliance, and it does not reflect: it literally cannot see itself in the mirror, which is to say it cannot recognize its own extractive relationship to the labor it feeds on.

In composition's economy, the vampire is the institution that consumes student writing labor and converts it to metrics — retention rates, assessment scores, credit hours, program reviews — without returning value to the writer. The student writes; the institution feeds. The feeding is not malicious. The vampire, in most traditions, doesn't hate its prey. It needs to eat. But the relationship is asymmetric, and the product of the feeding is the vampire's continued existence, not the victim's.

The vampire's distinctive mark: two puncture wounds that look like nothing until you know what to look for. The grade on a transcript. The checked box on an outcomes matrix.

## The Bestiary, in Calendar Order

What follows names seven figures distributed across the fall semester. Each corresponds to a moment in the academic calendar and a stage in the [[nexus-nyssa|corpse → compost → garden]] arc. Each appears, without announcement, in the narrative scenes that document Grant Miles's semester. The resonances between bestiary and narrative are dysraphic — the seams are visible, the joints don't close, and the reader who notices is performing the same stitching labor the course asks of its students.

### 1. The Specter — Labor Day (Week 1)

<!-- Narrative link: [[scene-placeholder]] -->

The semester begins on or after Labor Day. The holiday commemorating organized labor is, for most students, a day without content — the meaning has been extracted, leaving a day off whose referent has become spectral. Marx opened the _Manifesto_ with a specter haunting Europe; the specter is what persists after the conditions that produced it have been destroyed or forgotten. It is neither present nor absent. It conditions the present by the persistence of what was never fully realized.

A writing course that treats composition as economic activity begins on the ghost of a labor holiday. The students don't know this. Grant notices only that the library is closed and he doesn't have a shift. The irony is available to the design but not to the student, and that asymmetry — the designer sees the specter, the student sees a day off — is itself a structural feature of the corpse stage. The material is dead. Its history is not yet legible.

### 2. The Doppelgänger — Indigenous Peoples' Day (Week 6–7)

<!-- Narrative link: [[scene-placeholder]] -->

Two holidays occupy the same calendrical body. Columbus Day, written over by Indigenous Peoples' Day, neither fully erasing the other. The renaming makes the palimpsest visible: this day means two things that cannot be reconciled, and the calendar holds both without resolving the contradiction. The doppelgänger is the figure for what cannot be reconciled occupying the same form — the double that looks like you but serves a different purpose, the second self whose existence calls the first into question.

In the compost stage, students encounter doppelgängers in their own corpus. The fragment from Week 2 says one thing; the fragment from Week 6, written after Meadows, says something that looks like the same thing but isn't. The two fragments occupy the same conceptual territory and cannot be reconciled without transformation. The doppelgänger is not the contradiction itself but the recognition that both versions are yours.

Grant at the circulation desk might notice a display being changed, books reshelved from one category to another — the library performing its own reclassification while students perform theirs through BEAM tagging. The institutional doppelgänger: two classification systems, one body of material.

### 3. The Revenant — Homecoming (Week 7–8)

<!-- Narrative link: [[scene-placeholder]] -->

Homecoming is a revenant ritual. The alumni return — the past comes back to walk among the present, embodied, recognizable, changed. The revenant is not a ghost: it has a body. It physically occupies the space it once belonged to and finds that space altered, or finds itself altered, or both. The revenant's presence makes visible the difference between the campus as it was and the campus as it is, and neither version is more real than the other.

The fragment that returns is a revenant. The Week 3 freewrite, revisited in Week 8 after peer review and source integration, is recognizably the same piece of writing and recognizably not. It has been through something — decomposition, reclassification, contact with other texts — and what comes back carries the traces of that passage. The revenant's body bears the marks of where it's been.

Grant working the circulation desk during homecoming weekend might see the library emptied by the football game, the sound of the crowd distant, his position as someone who is _at_ the institution but not _in_ its spectacle. A first-generation student staffing the library while the institution performs its preferred version of itself.

### 4. The Mummy — Halloween (Week 8–9)

<!-- Narrative link: [[scene-placeholder]] -->

The mummy is the cheapest costume at the party. Toilet paper and a living body. The comedy is structural: actual mummification preserves the dead for a journey to an afterlife at which they haven't yet arrived. The costume is temporary, falling apart, performative preservation rather than actual preservation. A student wrapped in toilet paper is the opposite of a mummy and therefore its perfect representative — the form without the function, the wrapping without the embalming.

The mummy is the portfolio sealed by its reflective letter. The student's textual corpus, embalmed against decomposition, wrapped in assessment packaging, pointed toward a future — transfer, professional writing, the next course — at which it will not arrive in that form. The mummy's tragedy is that the afterlife requires decomposition. The preserved body cannot be composted. What was meant to protect the material from decay is what prevents it from becoming productive.

The terminal reflective letter is linen wrapping. The grade is resin. Together they produce an object that looks like it honors the dead — honors the student's labor — but in practice arrests the circulation that would give that labor continued life.

### 5. The Golem — Veterans Day (Week 10–11)

<!-- Narrative link: [[scene-placeholder]] -->

The golem is animated by inscription. The word _emet_ — truth — written on its forehead calls clay into service. Erasing a single letter produces _met_ — death. The distance between animation and deanimation is one act of writing.

The golem serves faithfully. It protects the community. It performs labor. And in most traditions, it is denied full membership in the community it serves — it does not count for the minyan, its labor is not recognized as equivalent to the labor of those it protects. The golem's service is structural: necessary, visible when it functions, invisible when the question of membership arises.

Grant's family is GI-descended Filipino-American. Filipino veterans of the Second World War were called into service by American military documents — animated by inscription — and had their status rescinded by the Rescission Act of 1946. _Emet_ to _met_. The GI Bill that eventually brought families like Grant's to the United States was the second inscription, a different word on a different forehead, a different kind of life in a different place. The question of whether the golem's labor counts — whether it qualifies for full membership in the community it served — is not abstract for Grant's family.

At the circulation desk on Veterans Day, the display goes up. The question of whose name appears on which wall, and whose doesn't, is a question about inscription. Grant notices. The word _circulation_ does quiet double duty.

### 6. The Changeling — Thanksgiving (Week 13–14)

<!-- Narrative link: [[scene-placeholder]] -->

The changeling is the child who comes back wrong. You sent a human child to the fairies; what returned looks like yours but behaves differently. The traditional diagnostic is recognition: the family _knows_ something has changed, even when the form is preserved. The traditional remedy is exposure to difficulty — place the changeling under pressure, and the fairy will reclaim its own. What survives the pressure is what was real.

Thanksgiving is the changeling's calendar moment for first-generation college students. Three months of reading, writing, decomposing, reclassifying — three months of the compost stage's slow transformation — and then the return home. "You've changed" is the folk diagnosis. The family sees the person they sent away. The student is no longer that person. The dissonance is the changeling's uncanny presence at the family table.

Or — and this may be darker — home is the changeling. Home hasn't changed. Grant's capacity to read it has. The familiar becomes strange because the frameworks for seeing have shifted. Defamiliarization through education: one of the things the course does whether or not it names it. The changeling fear is not that the child has been replaced but that the replacement is irreversible, that the real child — the one who hadn't yet read Meadows, hadn't yet decomposed a fragment, hadn't yet seen a pattern across thirty pieces of writing — is gone.

What survives the pressure of return is what Grant actually learned. Which may not be what the course intended to teach.

### 7. The Ghost — Winter Break (Week 15)

<!-- Narrative link: [[scene-placeholder]] -->

The semester ends. The corpus sits in its folder, untouched. The library closes for break. Grant's fragments accumulate silence.

Dickens's Ghost of Christmas Past shows Scrooge his own history as material he cannot revise — the choices already made, the value already extracted or abandoned, the versions of himself that persist whether he attends to them or not. The ghost is not the dead person but the dead _possibility_: the path not taken, the configuration refused, the essay that could have been assembled from these fragments if the writer had been different, or the same writer at a different moment.

A decomposed corpus is hauntological. It contains all the configurations considered and refused. The chosen portfolio is meaningful precisely because it was chosen from among alternatives the writer can almost see — the other essays, the other arguments, the other arrangements of the same material. The ghost is not the fragment that was cut but the _relationship between fragments_ that was never activated. The blood on the cutting room floor is evidence that selection happened, that the garden was cultivated rather than simply grown.

Over winter break, the garden is untended. The ghosts are audible because there is no new production to drown them out. Whether the corpus is alive or dead during this interval — whether the fragments retain their charge or go inert — depends on whether the reflection that precedes the break was terminal or reproductive. If terminal, the portfolio is sealed: a mummy. If reproductive, the corpus is dormant: a garden in winter, waiting for the labor that will reactivate it. The break is the test.

## Coda: The Monster Tends

The creature in Shelley's novel teaches itself to read. It overhears the De Lacey family's lessons, finds a copy of _Paradise Lost_, brings firewood anonymously to people who would reject it if they saw its face. The creature's tragedy is not its assembly from dead parts — that is simply its origin. The tragedy is that it is denied the garden: denied community, recognition, the chance to cultivate what its own labor produced.

The ethical position for the course designer: do not be Victor Frankenstein. Do not assemble and abandon. Do not start with a preconceived whole and tailor the parts to fit. And do not pretend that what you've assembled is under your control, because the creature — the student, the corpus, the portfolio, the webtext you are reading — is a being in its own right.

The monster is not tended. The monster _tends_.
