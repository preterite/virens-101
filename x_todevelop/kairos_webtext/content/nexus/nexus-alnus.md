# Alnus (Alder)

## Core Claim

Two courses with identical constraint sets — same formatting requirements, same citation expectations, same rubric criteria — will produce different learning outcomes if the constraints arrive in different sequences. This is the central theoretical claim: constraint sequencing names the deliberate design of when constraints arrive in a writing course and what handles them, and it proposes that the temporal architecture of constraint arrival shapes learning more decisively than the content of the constraints themselves. The claim reframes composition pedagogy as temporal design — a discipline concerned not primarily with what to teach but with when each element of instruction becomes available to the learner, and in what order.

## Theoretical Framework

[[nexus-taxus|Taxus]] establishes that generation must precede evaluation — that the first move in any productive sequence is to create the conditions under which experience-good value can be produced. But constraint sequencing generalizes beyond the opening gambit. The question is not only "should generation come first?" (yes, and Taxus says why) but: given that constraints will arrive, in what order should they arrive, and what is the principle governing that order?

Christopher Alexander's _Notes on the Synthesis of Form_ provides the design-theoretic foundation. Complex design problems contain interlocking constraints whose interactions are not fully knowable in advance. Alexander's method decomposes the problem into semi-independent subsystems, identifies misfits between form and context within each subsystem, and resolves misfits in an order that respects their dependencies — addressing foundational misfits before those that depend on foundational decisions being settled. The sequence is not arbitrary; it is determined by the dependency structure of the constraints themselves. A designer who resolves a dependent constraint before its foundation is settled will have to redo the work when the foundation changes. A designer who follows the dependency order does each piece of work once.

Applied to composition pedagogy, this reframes the semester as a dependency problem. Some constraints depend on others: you cannot meaningfully constrain citation format until a student has sources to cite; you cannot evaluate portfolio coherence until a student has a corpus to select from; you cannot require audience awareness until a student has material that an audience might encounter. These dependencies are structural, not matters of pedagogical preference. A course that assigns citation formatting in week two is not being rigorous — it is resolving a dependent constraint before its foundation exists. The work will have to be redone, and the cognitive effort spent on premature formatting is effort unavailable for the generation that formatting would later act upon.

Donella Meadows's leverage-point analysis strengthens the claim from a different direction. Meadows argues that the highest-leverage interventions in a system change its goals, rules, or structure rather than pushing harder on its parameters. Reordering constraint arrival is a structural intervention — it changes the system through which students encounter requirements rather than changing the requirements themselves. This is why constraint sequencing is a higher-leverage design variable than constraint content: two courses with the same requirements but different arrival sequences are structurally different systems producing different dynamics, even though their syllabi might look identical in a program review.

John Sweller's cognitive load theory identifies the mechanism by which frontloading fails. Working memory is finite; each simultaneously active constraint consumes cognitive resources. A student asked to generate ideas, organize them coherently, integrate sources using BEAM categories, format citations in MLA, write in academic register, and address a specified audience — all at once, as most assignment prompts demand — faces an intrinsic load that may exceed working capacity. The result is not poor execution across all dimensions but collapse into the most familiar: students default to the five-paragraph essay, the formulaic thesis statement, the citation dropped in without integration. These are not failures of knowledge but failures of load management. The student _knows_ how to do better but cannot hold all the demands simultaneously. Sequencing constraints across time distributes load across sessions, allowing each constraint to receive the cognitive attention it requires.

Mariolina Rizzi Salvatori's difficulty pedagogy connects constraint sequencing to the diagnostic work that [[nexus-ilex|Ilex]] develops. Salvatori argues that difficulty in reading and writing is not noise to be eliminated but information to be interpreted — a signal about the relationship between a reader's expectations and a text's demands. When difficulty is treated as diagnostic, it becomes a design resource: the points at which students struggle reveal which constraints are operating, which are in conflict, and which the student does not yet have the resources to satisfy. A well-sequenced course uses this information recursively — the difficulties that emerge in weeks four and five tell the instructor (and the student) which constraints should arrive next and which should wait. Donald Schön's reflection-in-action is the practitioner's version of the same logic: the reflective designer adjusts the constraint sequence in real time based on what the current sequence reveals about the problem's actual structure.

Vygotsky's zone of proximal development provides the developmental rationale. A constraint is pedagogically productive only when it falls within the zone — challenging enough to require new learning but not so far beyond current capacity that the learner cannot engage it meaningfully even with support. Constraint sequencing is the temporal enactment of ZPD management: early constraints are simple (write regularly, one claim per fragment, save your work) because they fall within virtually every entering student's zone; later constraints (source integration, cross-fragment coherence, portfolio-level argument) arrive only after prior work has expanded the zone to accommodate them. The sequence is not a fixed schedule but a developmental trajectory: each constraint's arrival depends on prior constraints having done their work.

What [[nexus-thuja|Thuja]] calls the properties of constraints — their visibility, readability, writability, and ownership — become sequencing variables here. A constraint can be invisible in week one and visible in week six; readable (the student can examine its rationale) in week eight and writable (the student can modify or negotiate it) in week twelve. The progressive redistribution of constraint ownership from instructor to student is itself a sequenced design: early constraints are instructor-owned (these are the rules); mid-semester constraints become readable (here is why this rule exists); late constraints become writable (now you decide how to handle this). The sequence of ownership transfer _is_ the pedagogy of developing writerly agency — not freedom from constraint but increasing capacity to identify, negotiate, and manage constraints deliberately. This is what distinguishes constraint sequencing from mere scaffolding: scaffolding is removed as competence develops, but constraints are not removed — their ownership changes hands.

## Course Implementation

VIRENS 101's constraint sequence operates in three stages whose boundaries correspond to the four-movement semester structure. Stage 1 (Movements 1–2, Weeks 1–7) operates under minimal constraint: write regularly, one claim per fragment, 150–400 words, save with date-stamped filenames. Citation formatting, organizational structure, audience specification, cross-fragment coherence, and surface polish are all deliberately absent. The few constraints present serve accumulation: regularity builds corpus, atomicity maintains fragment independence, word limits prevent over-investment in single pieces. Everything else is cleared to create space for [[nexus-taxus|Taxus]]'s generative principle.

Stage 2 (Movement 3, Weeks 8–11) introduces organizational and citational constraints as the material they act upon accumulates. Source engagement, BEAM categorization, peer review cycles, and cross-fragment connection arrive — not because week eight is an arbitrary scheduling decision but because by week eight students have twenty to thirty fragments and the organizational constraints have something non-trivial to organize. The difficulties that emerge at this stage — the pile is unwieldy, fragments contradict each other, sources don't connect as expected — are the diagnostic signals [[nexus-ilex|Ilex]] describes. They tell both student and instructor where the next constraints need to arrive.

Stage 3 (Movement 4, Weeks 12–15) layers evaluative and presentational constraints onto material that has already undergone multiple transformations. Portfolio coherence, audience specification, surface polish, genre conventions, and strategic selection arrive last because they depend on everything prior: you can select only from a corpus, polish only what has been structured, address an audience only with material that has been through the stages of accumulation and organization that give it substance worth addressing. Week 15's constraint environment is maximal — every constraint the course will ever impose is now active simultaneously. But the student working under that load is not the student who entered in week one. Fourteen weeks of sequenced constraint arrival have expanded the zone, built the corpus, and developed the capacity to hold multiple demands in productive tension rather than cognitive collapse.

## Scene Connections

This concept appears in:
- [[vera-01-envelope]] — Vera's opening design decisions: which constraints to withhold and why the sequence cannot be rearranged without destroying what it produces
- [[vera-03-midterm]] — Vera adjusting the constraint sequence mid-semester based on diagnostic information from student difficulty — Schön's reflection-in-action enacted as course design
- [[grant-03-automating]] — Grant's mid-semester encounter with constraints arriving in deliberate order, the moment when the sequence becomes visible as _designed_ rather than arbitrary
