## Core Claim

The transformation between writing labor and textual capital constitutes an actual economic cycle within composition pedagogy — not a metaphor borrowed from economics but economic activity in its own right. Recognizing this has consequences: it means the tools of economic analysis — value, labor, capital, appropriation — apply directly to the work of the composition classroom, and it means that questions about who benefits from that cycle, and at what stage, become answerable in structural rather than merely political terms.

## Theoretical Framework

Composition studies has long borrowed economic vocabulary without committing to economic analysis. We speak of "investing" in a draft, of writing as "cultural capital," of the "economies" of attention. But the borrowing is almost always metaphorical — a way of lending weight to claims about writing's importance without engaging the analytical apparatus that gives those terms their precision. When the discipline has engaged economics directly, the results have been revealing: the 2012 _JAC_ special issue on economies of writing demonstrated both the field's anxiety about economic language and its reluctance to let that language do actual analytical work.

The reluctance is understandable. Mainstream economics — the marginalist tradition from Jevons through the neoclassicals — treats value as a function of preference and scarcity, collapsing the distinction between labor and its products into price. Applied to writing, this framework produces Asao Inoue's labor-based grading: time spent writing equals value produced, a direct equivalence that, despite invoking Marx, relies on the Smithian premise that labor _is_ value rather than labor _producing_ value through transformation. The result is an egalitarian impulse grounded in the wrong economics — one that cannot explain why an hour of writing in week twelve produces more than an hour of writing in week two, or why the same operation performed on different material yields different results.

A Marxian frame — specifically, the overdetermined class analysis developed by Stephen Resnick and Richard Wolff and extended by J.K. Gibson-Graham — offers a different entry point. In this tradition, economic activity is the appropriation of value at any stage in the cycle of production, distribution, use, and re-production. Value is not equivalent to labor time; it is _produced_ by labor, _transformed_ through circulation, and _appropriated_ at multiple points by multiple actors. Gibson-Graham's crucial contribution is insisting that this cycle operates in non-capitalist as well as capitalist formations — in households, cooperatives, gift economies, and, we argue, classrooms.

If composition scholars understand writing as a technology, and technologies function to replace labor-intensive processes with capital-intensive ones, then that replacement is by definition economic. A student drafting a paragraph is engaged in production. A peer response is a circulation event. Revision is re-production. These are not metaphors for economic activity; they _are_ economic activity — non-market economic activity whose value is constituted differently from commodity exchange but is no less real for being non-market. This is why Gibson-Graham matters more than Bourdieu for this project. Bourdieu's "capital" is analogical, mapping structural homologies between domains. Gibson-Graham refuse the analogy: non-market production is still production.

### The Experience Goods Distinction

But what _kind_ of value does writing labor produce? This is where most economic accounts of composition stop short. If writing produces a commodity — a text exchangeable for a grade, a credential, a publication — then the analytical framework is straightforward: production costs, exchange value, surplus appropriation. But a text is not a commodity in any simple sense. It is closer to what economists since Philip Nelson have called an _experience good_: a good whose value cannot be assessed without undergoing the experience of consuming it.

More precisely: the labor that produces writing's value is itself experiential. Reading a difficult text across time. Writing through confusion toward partial clarity. Sitting with a peer's draft long enough to see what it is trying to become. Kenneth Arrow's analysis of learning by doing identifies the mechanism: productivity gains that come from the experience of production itself — not external investment or training but the cumulative effect of doing the work. Value is generated by the labor process and is inseparable from it. Arrow gives an economics-native way of saying what Sondra Perl's felt sense says phenomenologically — following the process _is_ the mechanism by which value is created, not a means to an independently specifiable end.

The experience goods framework does real theoretical work. It explains why William Baumol's cost disease applies to composition: sectors whose output depends on irreducible human labor face structurally rising costs relative to capital-substitutable sectors. Institutional pressure to reduce composition's costs is, structurally, pressure to destroy the mechanism that creates composition's value. It explains why assessment regimes systematically misrepresent what writing courses produce: institutional metrics were designed to count commodities, and experience goods are not commodities. And it provides the theorized limit on decomposition that [[env]] identifies as distinguishing VIRENS 101 from its historical predecessors: you can decompose the _preparation_ for experiential encounters — the routing, classification, and templating that the six-moves vocabulary names — but you cannot decompose the encounter itself without destroying what makes it valuable.

## Course Implementation

VIRENS 101 operationalizes this framework through textual accumulation. Students produce fragments — discrete units of 150–400 words, each containing one claim with supporting evidence — that accumulate across the semester into a corpus. The shift from discrete assessed performances to accumulated capital is itself the economic move: it is the difference between labor consumed in the moment of assessment and labor stored as capital available for future reconfiguration.

An early fragment supplies a claim for a later argument. A failed draft reveals a structural problem that informs the next attempt. A classification scheme developed in week four makes week ten's synthesis possible. The compounding is not metaphorical — a student who has accumulated forty fragments has material resources unavailable to one who has written five essays and received five grades. Past labor remains present as capital, and its value increases as the operations performed on it become more sophisticated.

The constraint sequence controls when different operations become available, ensuring that accumulation precedes the more complex transformations that depend on having material to work with. This timing is economic design: it is the pedagogical equivalent of ensuring that capital formation precedes the production processes that require capital inputs.

## Scene Connections

This concept appears in:
- [[vera-01-envelope]] — Vera's design philosophy establishes the economic frame as foundational to the course's architecture
- [[grant-03-automating]] — Grant encounters the framework's implications when he recognizes that his accumulated fragments have become resources, not just assignments
