# Taxus (Yew)

## Core Claim

Generation before evaluation is not pedagogical permissiveness but economic necessity. Premature constraint does not merely limit a writer's options — it destroys value that cannot be recovered, because the experience that would have produced it did not occur. "YOLO up, constrain down" names this principle as a designable sequence operating at every scale of composition, from the freewriting session to the semester arc. The phrase recovers Peter Elbow's generative pedagogy not as romantic expressivism but as a structural commitment to protecting the conditions under which experience-good value — the kind of value [[nexus-quercus|Quercus]] identifies as constitutive of writing labor — can accumulate into the textual capital that [[nexus-nerium|Nerium]] describes.

## Theoretical Framework

The social turn in composition studies made Elbow suspect. James Berlin read expressivism as ideological naïveté — the writer discovering an authentic self through language, oblivious to the social forces constituting both self and language. David Bartholomae positioned Elbow's pedagogy as retreat from the intellectual demands of the academy, preferring the comfort of personal voice to the discipline of entering scholarly conversation. By the early 2000s, "expressivism" had become a term of dismissal, and Elbow's generative methods — freewriting, the believing game, the separation of creating from evaluating — were filed under pedagogies the field had outgrown.

The filing was hasty. What Elbow actually describes is not self-expression but strategic sequencing. The separation of creating from evaluating is a temporal design decision: generate material first, then subject it to criteria. The believing game is not credulity but an epistemological method — a deliberate suspension of evaluative constraint to discover what a position can yield before deciding whether to accept it. Elbow's later work makes this increasingly explicit: his interest is in the _conditions_ that produce good thinking, and those conditions require that judgment arrive after material exists to be judged. Read structurally rather than ideologically, Elbow's pedagogy shares more with Christopher Alexander's constraint decomposition than with any romantic theory of authentic selfhood.

Alexander's _Notes on the Synthesis of Form_ provides the design-theoretic version of the same insight. Complex problems contain interlocking constraints that resist simultaneous satisfaction. The designer's task is to decompose the problem — to identify which constraints are independent, which conflict, and which can be relaxed without catastrophic loss. But decomposition requires exploration: you discover which constraints are operative by attempting to work without them. Misfits become visible through attempted fit. The designer who begins by imposing all known constraints simultaneously forecloses the exploration that would reveal which constraints actually matter and how they interact. Alexander's method is: expand the solution space, encounter resistance, let the resistance teach you where the constraints are. Then apply them — not all at once but in sequences that respect their dependencies.

Herbert Simon's satisficing completes the systems-thinking parallel. Bounded rationality means agents cannot optimize — they cannot survey all possibilities and select the best. Instead they generate options until they find one good enough to meet their constraints. The critical move is that generation _must precede_ selection: without a population of options, satisficing collapses into accepting whatever first presents itself. Simon's insight translates directly: a writer who generates extensively before evaluating has material to satisfice across; a writer constrained from the start has only whatever survived the initial filter, which is almost certainly a local maximum — a solution that looks adequate only because no alternatives were explored.

Sondra Perl's felt sense identifies the phenomenological mechanism. Experienced writers tolerate ambiguity during early composing, attending to an inchoate bodily sense of where the writing wants to go — what Perl, drawing on Gendlin, calls "felt sense." This tolerance is not passivity; it is an active resistance to premature structure that allows non-explicit understanding to guide generation. Imposing explicit criteria during this phase does not merely distract — it forecloses the felt sense by substituting external evaluation for internal attending. Ann Berthoff's formulation is the philosophical ground: "all making involves discovering." Possibilities do not exist prior to the exploration that reveals them. This is an ontological claim about what generation produces, not a pedagogical preference about how students should feel.

The economic connection to [[nexus-quercus|Quercus]] is precise. Kenneth Arrow's learning-by-doing analysis shows that productivity gains arise from the experience of production itself — cumulative, irreversible, and inseparable from the labor process. If writing is an experience good whose value is constituted by the doing, then premature interruption of doing does not merely delay value — it _destroys_ it, structurally and irreversibly. You cannot recover the felt sense that was never permitted to emerge, the constraint that was never encountered because the generative attempt that would have revealed it was truncated by an earlier constraint, the misfit that would have taught the writer where her argument's dependencies actually lie. The irreversibility is the economic claim. It is what distinguishes "YOLO up, constrain down" from mere advice to brainstorm before outlining: the principle identifies a category of value whose production requires the temporary absence of the evaluative mechanisms that will later act upon what it produces.

This has consequences for accumulation. [[nexus-nerium|Nerium]] argues that textual accumulation transforms student writing from discrete performances into capital available for reconfiguration. But accumulation requires raw material, and raw material requires generation, and generation requires protected space. A student who has written forty fragments across eight weeks possesses material resources unavailable to one who was constrained early and produced five polished paragraphs: the forty fragments can be recombined, reclassified, composted, distilled — operations whose value depends on having enough material that the operations are non-trivial. The five polished paragraphs are finished capital, low-entropy, resistant to reconfiguration. The difference between these two corpora is not quality but _phase_: one is in the generative phase where experience-good value is still being produced; the other has been prematurely moved to the evaluative phase where that value has already been cashed out.

The question this raises — not whether constraints arrive, but _when_ and in what order — is the territory of constraint sequencing, which [[nexus-alnus|Alnus]] addresses directly. Taxus establishes the precondition: an early move in any productive sequence must be to create the conditions under which value can be generated.

## Course Implementation

VIRENS 101 enacts YOLO up at multiple scales. The Week 1 envelope exercise operates at semester scale: students write hopes, fears, and goals, seal them unread, and do not open them until Week 15. No one evaluates the contents — not peers, not the instructor, not the student herself. The envelope creates a sandbox for aspiration where evaluative constraint is not merely delayed but physically excluded by the sealed paper. The Week 15 return performs the complementary move: here is what you dreamed; here is what the semester's constraints made possible; the gap between them is not failure but the visible work of constraint on generated material.

At weekly scale, the W–P–R rhythm embeds the cycle: Write blocks are generative (expand the corpus), Peer blocks introduce external perspective (new constraints arrive), Revise blocks apply constraint (let criteria sort what stays). Movement 1's W-heavy design — three weeks of predominantly generative work before sustained peer review begins — is the semester-scale enactment: accumulate material before introducing the social and evaluative constraints that will act upon it. The design trusts that constraint will arrive. It insists only that constraint not arrive before the material it acts upon exists.

## Scene Connections

This concept appears in:
- [[vera-01-envelope]] — Vera's design philosophy for the course opening: why constraint removal is the first pedagogical move, and what it costs to get the sequencing wrong
- [[grant-01-firstday]] — Grant's encounter with a composition classroom that asks him to generate without criteria, and the disorientation of permission
