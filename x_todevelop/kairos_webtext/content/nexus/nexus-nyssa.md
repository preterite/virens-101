# Nyssa (Tupelo)

## Core Claim

The cycle that [[nexus-quercus|Quercus]] names — writing labor becoming textual capital, entering circulation, being consumed, and reproducing as new labor — usually does not complete. The portfolio is submitted. The grade is recorded. The semester ends. The corpus goes into a folder the student never opens again. Use was terminal. The cycle ran once and halted. Nyssa asks why, and the answer is structural: the cycle arrests because the available assessment technology requires a predetermined form for the assembled result. Refusing the predetermined whole — letting the parts find their own fusion — is the design principle that allows the cycle to reproduce rather than terminate.

## Theoretical Framework

Eleven nexus pages have traced the mechanisms of composition's economic cycle: how labor transforms into capital, how constraint sequences shape production, how accumulation builds the stock from which analytical properties emerge, how value gets appropriated at each stage. The question that remains is whether the cycle completes. Whether the student's textual labor, having been produced, circulated, and assessed, feeds back into further production — or whether assessment is where the value gets extracted and the process stops.

For most composition pedagogy, it stops. [[nexus-nerium|Nerium]] identified the structural mechanism: portfolio assessment, even in its most sophisticated forms, organizes itself around a synchronic snapshot that freezes value at the moment of evaluation. The reflective letter seals the portfolio. The grade converts process into product. What Nerium did not name is the deeper design problem that produces this arrest.

Charles Bernstein, writing about the poetics of assembly, identifies it precisely. "When you put bits and pieces of language together you get more than the sum of the parts," he writes, "the process resembling Dr. Frankenstein's stitching together pieces of flesh and engendering not dead matter ... but a new kind of human being and a being in its own right." The creature assembled from parts, allowed to find its own coherence, is alive. What made the creature a monster, Bernstein argues, "was the reverse — starting with a preconceived whole and tailoring the parts to fit."

The rubric is Frankenstein. Not rubrics in general — a rubric that assesses the quality of the relationships between parts, the visibility of the process, the evidence that selection happened, serves as the rhapsodist's audience, listening for how the stitching was done. But a rubric that specifies what the assembled whole should look like before the assembling begins is a blueprint imposed on parts that have their own histories, their own tendencies, their own ways of wanting to join. The student who has accumulated forty fragments across fourteen weeks and now must arrange them into a portfolio matching predetermined categories is Victor Frankenstein working backward from a vision of what "human" should look like. The result will move. It may even be assessed as competent. But the joints will be wrong, because the parts were forced into positions they did not arrive at through their own developmental logic.

Bernstein offers a name for the alternative. _Dysraphism_ — from _rhaphe_, seam, making the rhapsodist "one who stitches parts together, that is, a reciter of epic poetry." The rhapsodist does not compose from a blueprint. The rhapsodist assembles from a repertoire of existing pieces under real-time constraints, and the result coheres through the articulation of parts rather than conformity to a template. Walter Ong recognized this as the primary mode of composition: oral performers stitched formulaic elements into sequences that were never identical twice but always recognizable, always functional, always a whole made of differences. Writing froze the repertoire into fixed text, which is what made the preconceived-whole problem possible in the first place. You cannot impose a rubric on an oral performance because the performance does not exist until the performer performs it. The rubric requires fixity. Fixity requires writing. Writing is the technology that enables Frankenstein.

But Bernstein is not nostalgic for orality. Writing-as-technology can operate rhapsodically if the parts are allowed to maintain their autonomy. _Dys_-raphism — congenital misseaming — is not a failure of coherence but a structural feature: the seams between parts remain visible, the joints do not fully close, and the resulting whole is alive precisely because it does not conform to a preconceived shape. The student's portfolio, assembled from fragments generated under different constraints at different moments by a writer who was different each time, coheres not by smoothing those differences but by making the relations between different parts legible. Process archaeology — tracing an idea across multiple fragments — is dysraphic reading. It follows the seam, not the surface.

This is the design principle that allows the cycle to reproduce. The corpse-compost-garden arc names what reproductive circulation looks like in practice, and the mapping is not metaphorical — it describes the same economic cycle Quercus established, in terms that make its organic, temporal, labor-intensive character visible.

Corpse is production. Material is generated without predetermined purpose. Fragments accumulate — dead in the sense that they do not yet participate in an argument, alive in the sense that writing labor has been performed and textual capital created. The value is latent. Compost is distribution. Material moves between contexts: peer review sends it to other readers, BEAM tagging reclassifies it, source integration connects it to external texts. The fragments decompose — they break into components that can be reassembled differently. The value is being transformed through circulation. Garden is use that feeds back into production. The portfolio is not consumption but cultivation. The student selects, arranges, polishes, and the act of selection generates new understanding that becomes the next corpse. The garden produces seeds. The portfolio that tells a "unified story" is the garden viewed synchronically, from the outside. The portfolio whose seams remain visible — whose process archaeology shows the dysraphic joints between Week 3 and Week 12, between the fragment written before Meadows and the fragment written after — is the garden viewed from inside, by the writer whose labor produced it. Both views are available. Only the second feeds reproduction.

Bernstein's final image: "the only mark of its past, of its having been made, is the blood on the cutting room floor." The blood is simultaneously corpse (evidence that cutting happened, that material was killed to produce this configuration), evidence of labor (someone did this work, and the work had costs), and condition of the living text (the poem's "continual newness in being made" coexists with the marks of its past). The corpse-compost-garden arc is not a redemption narrative. Dead things do not come back to beautiful life. The seams stay visible. The joints do not close. The blood stays on the floor. What the arc describes is a process in which the non-resolution is productive — in which the dysraphic tension between parts is what generates the energy for the next cycle.

## Course Implementation

VIRENS 101 does not present the corpse-compost-garden arc as a metaphor to be understood. It presents it as a calendar to be inhabited. Weeks 1–4 are corpse weeks: students generate fragments without predetermined purpose, accumulating material whose value is not yet legible. Weeks 5–9 are compost weeks: fragments decompose through peer review, reclassification, and source integration, breaking into components available for new configurations. Weeks 10–15 are garden weeks: students cultivate portfolios from composted material, selecting and arranging and discovering what their corpus knows.

The metaphor normalizes each stage's characteristic difficulty — anxiety in the corpse stage, confusion in the compost stage, the vertiginous recognition of the garden stage — but normalization is itself a form of containment, and containment is a form of closure. The course also names what the metaphor does not normalize: the fear that what emerges from decomposition will not be recognizable, that the assembled result will not match what anyone intended, that the parts will escape their wholes. These fears are structural, not psychological. They describe what happens when the cycle is allowed to reproduce rather than terminate. They have [[bestiary|names]].

## Scene Connections

This concept appears in:
- [[grant-05-corpusreview|G5]] — Grant's encounter with his accumulated corpus at the threshold of the garden stage: the moment where the material's emergent properties become visible and the question of what to assemble from it becomes real
- [[grant-06-synthesis|G6]] — Grant's late-semester work, assembling a portfolio whose seams remain visible and whose coherence comes from the articulation of parts rather than conformity to a template

## &#x200B;

The webtext you are reading was assembled from parts. Its twelve nexus pages were written at different moments under different constraints by a writer who changed across the writing. The seams between economics and poetics, between course design and literary theory, between Meadows and Bernstein and Ong, do not close. The coherence, if there is one, is dysraphic.

This is the material. [[contributing|Take what is useful. Compost the rest.]]
