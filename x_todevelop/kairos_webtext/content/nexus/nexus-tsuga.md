# Tsuga (Hemlock)

## Core Claim

Relationships between texts are structural dependencies that citation practices make partially visible. Like software dependencies, intellectual debts constrain what is possible at each stage of development: you cannot build an argument that depends on a source you have not read, and the order in which dependencies are resolved shapes the argument's final form. Citation is not attribution alone but dependency declaration — and like all dependency systems, it can be audited, managed, and designed. Reframing citation as dependency management transforms it from a formatting requirement into a constraint whose sequencing is subject to the same temporal design logic that [[nexus-alnus|Alnus]] describes for the course as a whole.

## Theoretical Framework

Composition pedagogy has traditionally treated citation as two things: a mechanical requirement (follow MLA or APA format) and a moral injunction (do not plagiarize). Both framings position citation as compliance — rules to follow, consequences for violation. The result is students who format bibliographies correctly and avoid direct copying but who do not understand what citations _do_ in an argument. The formatting is delegable to machines (Zotero generates a bibliography in seconds); the moral framing produces anxiety rather than understanding. Neither teaches what Charles Bazerman calls "intertextual self-fashioning" — the way citation practices construct an author's identity by making visible which intellectual traditions she draws on, which conversations she enters, and which positions she occupies within those conversations.

Bazerman's analysis of scientific citation practices reveals that citations are rhetorical acts, not clerical ones. A scientist citing prior work is not merely acknowledging a debt; she is constructing a narrative about the state of knowledge in her field, positioning her own contribution relative to that narrative, and signaling to readers which intellectual traditions she considers relevant. The same operation occurs in student writing, though composition pedagogy rarely frames it that way. A student who cites Salvatori is not just avoiding plagiarism — she is declaring a dependency: her argument requires Salvatori's framework to function, and if Salvatori's claims were to be dismantled, the student's argument would need restructuring. This is the dependency claim in its precise form: citations declare the structural load-bearing relationships within an argument.

James Porter's intertextuality provides the theoretical ground. All writing, Porter argues, exists within a web of prior texts — no utterance is fully original, and meaning arises from the relationships between texts rather than from any text in isolation. Citation makes a portion of this web explicit. But only a portion: the influences a writer acknowledges through formal citation are a subset of the dependencies actually operating. Genre conventions, disciplinary assumptions, syntactic patterns absorbed through reading — these are all dependencies that shape the argument without appearing in the works cited. The pedagogical consequence is that citation instruction should not begin with formatting but with dependency awareness: what does your argument depend on, and how much of that dependency structure are you currently able to see?

Frederick Brooks's dependency management from software engineering provides the structural analogy that is not merely analogical. In software, a dependency is a component that another component requires in order to function — change the dependency and the dependent component breaks. Complex software projects require explicit dependency tracking because the interactions between components are too numerous and too consequential to manage by intuition. The same is true of complex arguments. A student working with five or six sources across a semester-long corpus is managing a dependency network: Source A provides the framework, Source B provides the evidence, Source C provides the counterargument, and the relationships between them constrain what the student's argument can claim. If Source B's evidence turns out not to support the framework from Source A, the whole structure needs revision. Making these dependencies explicit — auditable, visible, manageable — is the work that citation-as-dependency performs.

Joseph Bizup's BEAM taxonomy operationalizes the dependency-type distinction. Background sources provide context (weak dependency — substitutable); Exhibit sources provide the primary material under analysis (strong dependency — the argument requires _this_ text); Argument sources advance claims the writer engages (dialogic dependency — the writer's thinking responds to theirs); Method sources provide analytical frameworks or procedures (structural dependency — borrowed intellectual tools). BEAM makes the type of dependency explicit, which is itself a constraint-sequencing move: students learn to distinguish between sources they lean on heavily and sources they could replace, which changes how they manage their arguments when revision requires restructuring.

Rebecca Moore Howard's work on patchwriting connects to the developmental dimension. Howard argues that patchwriting — close paraphrase that hovers near the source's language — is not plagiarism but an intermediate stage in learning to work with sources. It is the moment at which the student is dependent on the source's language because she has not yet developed sufficient independence to reformulate the ideas in her own terms. Read through the dependency framework, patchwriting is a signal of unresolved dependency: the student's argument cannot yet stand independently of the source's formulation. The pedagogical response is not punishment but developmental — the student needs more experience with the source, more encounters with alternative formulations, more accumulated material from which to construct an independent position. This is why citation instruction belongs in the middle of the constraint sequence rather than at the beginning: the student needs accumulated material ([[nexus-nerium|Nerium]]) and generative experience ([[nexus-taxus|Taxus]]) before dependency management becomes meaningful work.

The connection to [[nexus-ilex|Ilex]] is structural: both pages address making invisible systems visible. Ilex treats difficulty as the mechanism by which infrastructure reveals itself; Tsuga treats citation as the mechanism by which intellectual dependencies reveal themselves. Both are cases of systems that operate beneath attention until deliberate practice brings them to the surface. The shared scene connection (V5) reflects this: Vera's design reflections in the same narrative moment address both the diagnostic value of student difficulty and the pedagogical architecture of source integration, because both are instances of making the invisible infrastructures of composition available for examination.

## Course Implementation

VIRENS 101 sequences citation instruction across the same four movements that organize the course's constraint arrival. Movement 1 practices implicit citation: students name influences in freewriting ("This idea came from...") without formal formatting, building the habit of acknowledging intellectual debt before learning its mechanics. Movement 2 introduces explicit citation through two simultaneous moves — Zotero handles the mechanical formatting (delegating the compliance dimension to a machine), while BEAM taxonomy and the SEAR protocol (Situate, Embed, Analyze, Relate) focus human attention on the rhetorical work of source integration. The separation is deliberate: by automating format, the course frees class time for the dependency analysis that machines cannot perform.

Movement 3 advances to strategic citation: students manage multiple sources across their accumulating corpus, conduct citation audits to identify patterns in their dependency networks (whose voices are present? whose are absent? which BEAM types dominate?), and pursue documented inquiries requiring synthesis across five or more sources. Movement 4 makes citation fully reflective: portfolio introductions narrate the works cited page as a story of intellectual development ("How did my relationship to this source change over the semester?"), and process archaeology traces how citation patterns shifted as the argument took shape. By Week 15, the student's citation practice has moved from compliance to dependency awareness to strategic management to reflective self-fashioning — a constraint-sequenced developmental arc mirroring the course's larger design.

## Scene Connections

This concept appears in:
- [[grant-03-automating]] — Grant's mid-semester encounter with citation as something other than formatting: the moment when sources become structural elements of his argument rather than requirements to fulfill, and the disorientation of realizing his thinking depends on texts he has not fully understood
- [[vera-05-difficulty]] — Vera's design reflection on the relationship between student difficulty with sources and the dependency structures those difficulties reveal — the instructor's view of citation as diagnostic infrastructure, shared with [[nexus-ilex|Ilex]]'s framing
