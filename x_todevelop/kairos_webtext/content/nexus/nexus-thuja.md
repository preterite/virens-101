# Thuja (Cedar)

## Core Claim

Constraints possess identifiable properties — visibility, rationale, writability, ownership — that pedagogical design can redistribute across participants and across time. Not all constraints operate in the same mode: some are visible to the writer, others hidden in institutional expectation or genre convention; some have articulable rationales, others are inherited without explanation; some are fixed, others negotiable; some belong to the instructor, the institution, the discipline, or the writer. Making these properties explicit transforms constraints from background conditions into designable elements of a pedagogy. The permission flags model, adapted from Unix file system permissions, provides the analytical vocabulary for this work.

## Theoretical Framework

[[nexus-ilex|Ilex]] establishes that difficulty reveals constraints otherwise invisible. But once a constraint has been revealed, the pedagogical question is not simply whether to enforce it or remove it — it is how to characterize its properties so that both instructor and student can make informed decisions about how it operates. The permission flags model provides four dimensions along which any constraint can be analyzed.

The first is visibility: does the student know the constraint exists? A citation formatting requirement printed on the syllabus is visible; an instructor's unspoken expectation that paragraphs should open with topic sentences is invisible. The distinction matters because invisible constraints produce difficulty that students cannot diagnose — the five-paragraph essay "feels wrong" for a complex argument, but the student cannot name the mismatch because the convention being violated was never articulated. Making a constraint visible is the minimal pedagogical act: it moves the constraint from infrastructure (operating beneath attention) to object of attention.

The second is readability: can the student examine the constraint's rationale? A visible constraint ("Use MLA format") may have no accompanying explanation, leaving the student with a rule to follow but no understanding of why. A readable constraint ("Use MLA format because citation conventions signal disciplinary membership and allow readers to locate your sources") provides the rationale that makes the constraint intelligible as a rhetorical choice rather than an arbitrary imposition. Readability is what Donald Norman calls a signifier — not merely the existence of an affordance or constraint but a signal that communicates its purpose and logic to the user.

The third is writability: can the student modify, negotiate, or customize the constraint? Some constraints are fixed — the assignment deadline is not negotiable, the word count cannot be exceeded. Others are writeable — the student chooses the topic, selects the organizational structure, decides which sources to foreground. Writability is where agency enters the framework. A student working under entirely fixed constraints is executing a prescription; a student working under mixed fixed and writable constraints is making rhetorical decisions within a designed space. Stuart Selber's multiliteracies framework describes the progression: functional literacy (using tools as given), critical literacy (understanding how tools shape work), rhetorical literacy (deploying tools strategically). The move from fixed to writable constraints enacts this progression — the student moves from following the rule to understanding the rule to deciding when and how to apply the rule.

The fourth is ownership: who controls the constraint? Some constraints belong to the instructor ("This assignment requires three sources"), some to the institution ("Papers must be submitted through the LMS by midnight"), some to the discipline ("Academic prose uses hedging language for uncertain claims"), and some to the writer ("I want this piece to sound conversational because my audience is my peers"). The distribution of ownership across these four levels is itself a design variable. A course in which all constraints are instructor-owned is an apprenticeship; a course in which ownership progressively transfers to the student is a development sequence. The transfer of ownership is not the removal of constraint — it is the redistribution of who decides how the constraint operates.

Donald Schön's reflective practitioner provides the developmental logic. Professional expertise, Schön argues, involves knowing when to follow rules and when to violate them — a judgment that requires both understanding the rule's rationale (readability) and having the authority to depart from it (writability and ownership). The novice follows rules because rule-following is all that is available; the expert follows or departs from rules based on situated judgment about what the current situation demands. The pedagogical trajectory is from novice to expert: early in the semester, most constraints are instructor-owned and fixed, because the student does not yet have the basis for informed departure; later, constraints become readable, then writable, then student-owned, as the student develops the judgment to manage them.

Vygotsky's zone of proximal development operates here differently than in [[nexus-alnus|Alnus]]. Alnus uses ZPD to time when constraints arrive; Thuja uses it to time when constraint _ownership_ transfers. A student who has never written with sources is not ready to own the decision about how many sources to include — the constraint must be instructor-owned ("Use at least three sources") until the student has enough experience to make the decision meaningfully. But a student who has written extensively with sources and has developed judgment about when sources strengthen and when they clutter is ready for the constraint to become writable ("Decide how many sources this argument needs and justify your choice in the dev log"). The ZPD governs not the constraint's existence but its mode.

The Unix metaphor is not decorative. File permissions in Unix specify exactly who can do what: read (examine), write (modify), execute (run). The owner, the group, and others each have independent permission settings. Applied to composition, the precision is useful: a constraint can be readable to the student but writable only by the instructor, or visible to the class but owned by the discipline. The metaphor provides a notation system — a way of talking about constraint properties with enough precision that design decisions become explicit rather than intuitive. This is what distinguishes the permission flags model from general talk about "scaffolding" or "gradual release of responsibility": those frameworks describe a trajectory but not a mechanism. Permission flags describe both the trajectory (constraints move from instructor-owned to student-owned) and the mechanism (specific properties change at specific moments for specific reasons).

## Course Implementation

VIRENS 101 sequences permission changes across the four movements. In Movement 1, constraints are minimal in number but instructor-owned and mostly invisible in rationale: write regularly, one claim per fragment, save your work. The rationale for these constraints is not yet articulated because articulation at this stage would be premature — the student has not yet experienced enough to understand why regularity or atomicity matters. In Movement 2, constraints become readable: the SEAR procedure for source integration is introduced with explanation of why each step exists, and peer review protocols are accompanied by explicit rationale for the sequence of generous-before-evaluative feedback. By Movement 3, selected constraints become writable: the spec document assignment asks students to define appropriate constraints for their own projects, negotiating which conventions to follow and which to depart from based on rhetorical situation. In Movement 4, constraint ownership transfers substantially to the student: portfolio construction requires deciding what to include, what to cut, how to sequence, and how to frame — all decisions that were instructor-owned in earlier movements. The Week 15 portfolio is a fully student-owned constraint environment operating under student judgment, not instructor prescription.

## Scene Connections

This concept appears in:
- [[vera-06-permissions]] — Vera's late-semester reflection on the permission transfer: which students took ownership productively, which struggled with the writability of late constraints, and what that reveals about the design's assumptions
- [[grant-06-ownership]] — Grant's retrospective recognition that the course's structure was not arbitrary but designed — the moment when the constraint sequence becomes visible as intentional architecture, and the disorientation of discovering that the rules he followed early were not the _point_ but the _preparation_
