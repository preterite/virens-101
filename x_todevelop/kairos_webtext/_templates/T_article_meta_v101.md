## Argument Architecture

### Problem/Exigence
[What gap, tension, or question motivates this piece?]

### Theoretical Framework
[What conceptual apparatus organizes the argument?]

### Evidence/Demonstration
[What grounds the claims? Course materials, student work, existing scholarship?]

### Implications
[What follows for the field if the argument holds?]

## Structural Design

### Organizational Model
Dual-narrator documentation fiction with nexus concept pages

### Track Structure

| Track | Narrator | Scenes | Function |
|-------|----------|--------|----------|
| Designer | Dr. Vera Green | V1-V6 | System design perspective |
| Student | Grant Miles | G1-G6 | Experience perspective |
| Nexus | Academic prose | 12 pages | Theoretical grounding |

### Entry Points
- Begin with Vera (designer perspective)
- Begin with Grant (student perspective)
- Begin with Nexus (theoretical framework)

### Convergence Nodes
[Where do different paths meet?]

---

## Interlocutors & Positioning

### Primary Conversation Partners
| Scholar | Key Text | Your Relation |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| | | Building on / Extending / Recovering / Challenging |

### Disciplinary Positioning
[Where does this sit in the field's current conversations?]

### Anticipated Objections
| Objection | Response Strategy |
|-----------|-------------------|
| | |

## Venue Considerations

### Primary Venue: Kairos
- **Section**: Inventio (experimental webtext)
- **Fit**: Allows non-linear navigation, documentation fiction, visual design
- **Conventions**: Multimodal, interactive, theoretically grounded
- **Recent examples**: [Similar pieces published there]

### Backup Venue: Writing on the Edge
- **How would the piece need to change?**: Linearize, reduce interactivity
