Ground in specific moment:
- Where is Grant?
- What's he trying to do?
- What's not working?
-->



<!--
MIDDLE (2-3 paragraphs)
The struggle or discovery:
- Specific details of the difficulty/recognition
- Internal monologue
- Sensory grounding
-->



<!--
CLOSE (1 paragraph)
End with partial recognition:
- Something clicks, but not everything
- A question forms
- Forward motion, but uncertainty remains
-->
