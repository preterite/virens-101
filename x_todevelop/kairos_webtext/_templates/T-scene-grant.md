**Week ** | **M**

<!-- 
GRANT SCENE TEMPLATE
Target length: 1200-1500 words
Voice: First-person, present tense
Tone: Casual but increasingly precise; relatable frustrations; internal monologue

CHARACTER REMINDERS:
- Filipino heritage (American father, Filipina mother) — mostly implicit
- First-gen college student
- Works 12-15 hrs/week at library circulation desk
- Smart but organizationally chaotic
- Phone addiction as material constraint
- Struggles are executive function, not comprehension

BEFORE DRAFTING, check:
- [ ] Scene outline in _planning/scenes/
- [ ] Concepts this scene must demonstrate
- [ ] Arc position (confusion → clarity progression)
- [ ] Library job details that could surface
-->

## Opening

<!-- 
Ground the reader in Grant's immediate experience:
- Physical location (library desk, dorm, classroom)
- What he's trying to do right now
- Sensory details (phone buzzing, cart wheels, screen glow)
- Internal state (stressed, confused, surprised)
-->



## Development

<!--
The scene's main action. Grant should:
- Struggle with something specific and relatable
- Have internal monologue that reveals his thinking
- Interact with course materials/system/peers
- Show partial understanding (not full clarity yet)

KEY CONCEPTS TO WEAVE IN (through experience, not explanation):
- 
- 

LIBRARY PARALLEL OPPORTUNITY?
- Does his library work echo what's happening in class?
-->



## Turn

<!--
A moment of partial recognition:
- "Oh, this is what..." or "Wait, that's like..."
- Something clicks, but not everything
- Frustration that opens into possibility
- Connection he didn't expect
-->



## Close

<!--
Land with:
- What Grant does next (action, not just thought)
- Lingering question or uncertainty
- Forward momentum into next scene/week
- Optional: echo of Vera's design (that Grant doesn't see)
-->

- [ ] Library job details feel natural (not forced)?
- [ ] Connections to other scenes noted in frontmatter?
- [ ] Status updated?
