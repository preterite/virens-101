# Fragment: {{title}}

<!-- 
FRAGMENT TEMPLATE
Purpose: Provisional brainstorming units that cluster around nexus pages
Location: _planning/fragments/

Fragments are:
- Movable: primary-nexus assignment is provisional
- Connective: resonances show cross-tree links
- Developmental: raw material for concept notes and nexus pages

In graph view, fragments should cluster around their primary nexus.
Resonance links create bridges between clusters.
