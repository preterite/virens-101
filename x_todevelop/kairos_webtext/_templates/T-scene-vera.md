<!-- 
VERA SCENE TEMPLATE
Target length: 1200-1500 words
Voice: Third-person limited, Vera's perspective
Tone: Scholarly but warm, systems-aware, observational

BEFORE DRAFTING, check:
- [ ] Scene outline in _planning/scenes/
- [ ] Concepts this scene must demonstrate
- [ ] Connections to Grant scenes (same week? echo? setup?)
-->

## Opening

<!-- 
Ground the reader in:
- Physical setting (office, classroom, walking commute)
- Temporal moment (time of day, point in semester)
- Vera's immediate task or thought
-->



## Development

<!--
The scene's main action. Vera should:
- Think in systems terms naturally
- Notice patterns (in student work, behavior, data)
- Make design decisions visible to reader
- Connect present moment to semester arc

KEY CONCEPTS TO WEAVE IN:
- 
- 
-->



## Turn

<!--
A moment of recognition, decision, or shift:
- Something Vera notices that changes her thinking
- A design choice crystallizing
- Evidence confirming or complicating her plans
-->



## Close

<!--
Land the scene with:
- Forward motion (what happens next, what she'll do)
- Resonance with course themes
- Optional: subtle connection to parallel Grant moment
-->
