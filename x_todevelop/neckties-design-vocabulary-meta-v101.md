# Neckties as Design Vocabulary

Why neckties as a design vocabulary?

**Practical answer**: they're available. I have an archive of ties accumulated over two decades of professional work, ready-to-hand with a little digital processing. That availability is a principle for this project: work with the materials you accumulate.

**Contextual answer**: neckties embody the productive tension between constraint and expression that animates the course design documented here. For men operating in the professional environments that require them, neckties represent one of vanishingly few opportunities for individual ornament in the expressive desert of male professional fashion. They invite experimentation within and complementary to the bounds of constraint.

**Theoretical answer**: neckties carry meanings appropriate to this text's scholarly and pedagogical modes of investigation. They signal work: directed activity, purposeful constraint, doing something that matters. When I'm in the classroom wearing a tie, that signals one kind of attention; when I'm in my office with the knot loosened and collar unbuttoned, reading or typing, another. Those meanings are historical and layered. Beyond professional labor, neckties once signaled elevated play, in the protocol-laden social and arts events where formality indicated respect for the occasion. Those associations inform my design choices here. The florals and paisleys you encounter on the student-focused pages and the geometrics and checks on the design-focused pages are particular to the embodied modes in which I typically engage colleagues like you. Finally, neckties function through difference. They operate in relation to the other elements of self-presentation via pattern, color, and material. They say, _look here_.
