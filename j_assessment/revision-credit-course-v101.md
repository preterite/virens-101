## Overview

In this course, **revision is not optional cleanup—it's essential intellectual work**. This page explains how your revision efforts are recognized and rewarded through three interconnected assessment mechanisms:

1. **Revision & Feedback component** (20% of final grade)
2. **Portfolio assessment** (revision as evidence of outcomes)
3. **Reflective one-pagers** (documentation of revision decisions)

Unlike courses where you "turn in a draft, get it back, fix errors, and submit final," this course values **revision as rethinking**—using feedback to see your work differently and make substantive changes.

**Justification**: [[revision-credit-reasons-v101#Core Principle|Why revision matters]]

## How Revision Earns Credit

### Revision & Feedback: 20% of Final Grade

This is the **highest-weighted formative component**, split into two parts:

#### Eli Review Participation (10%)

**What counts**:
- Completing peer review cycles on time
- Providing helpful feedback to classmates (average rating 3.5+/5.0)
- Submitting revised work after receiving feedback

**Six graded cycles** across semester:
- Weeks 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 14
- Each cycle worth ~40 points (240 total points = 24% of course grade = 10% after scaling)

**What "helpful feedback" means**:
- **Describe**: What you see the writer doing
- **Evaluate**: How well it works for stated purpose
- **Suggest**: Specific actions for improvement (not "make it better")

**Helpfulness ratings**:
- Your peers rate your feedback 1-5 stars
- Average rating 3.5+ = full credit for that cycle
- Lower ratings = proportional reduction (2.5 avg = 50% credit)

**Why this earns credit**: Giving good feedback requires reading carefully and thinking strategically—it's intellectual work that improves your own writing.

#### Reflective One-Pagers (10%)

**Four assigned across semester**:
- Week 6 (after M1 work)
- Week 9 (after M2 work)
- Week 12 (after M3 work)
- Week 14 (portfolio preparation)

**Each worth 2.5% of final grade**

**What one-pagers must include**:
1. **Specific feedback you received** (quoted from Eli Review or instructor comments)
2. **How you responded to feedback** (what you changed and why)
3. **What you learned about revision** (metacognitive reflection)

**Example of strong one-pager excerpt**:
> "Reviewer 2 noted that my opening 'states the claim without earning it through storytelling.' This feedback made me realize I was arguing my way into the reader's trust instead of narrating my way there. In response, I added the elementary school library scene (now pp. 1-2) that shows my relationship with reading before I try to analyze it. This revision transformed my understanding of how narrative evidence works—sometimes you need to let readers experience something before you interpret it for them."

**Why this earns credit**: Documenting your revision decisions makes your learning visible and develops metacognitive awareness—understanding *how* you revise, not just *that* you revised.

**Justification**: [[revision-credit-reasons-v101#Feedback Component|Why 20% weight?]]

## Revision in Portfolio Assessment

### Portfolio = 50% of Final Grade

Your portfolio is assessed holistically for achievement of seven course outcomes. **Revision is central to this assessment** in three ways:

#### 1. Polished Pieces Show Revision History

**What this means**:
- Include tracked changes showing evolution from draft to final
- Include peer feedback you received on these pieces
- Portfolio shows *how* pieces got better, not just final versions

**Example portfolio structure**:
```
Polished Piece #1: Literacy Narrative
├── Draft 1 (Week 4, pre-peer review)
├── Peer feedback received (Week 5 Eli cycle)
├── Draft 2 (Week 6, post-revision)
├── Instructor feedback (Week 7)
├── Final version (Week 12, polished for portfolio)
└── Reflective one-pager (Week 6, documenting changes)
```

**Why this matters**: Showing revision process demonstrates that good writing emerges through multiple iterations, not single drafts.

#### 2. Revision Demonstrates Specific Outcomes

Several course outcomes explicitly require revision:

**Outcome 2: Composing Processes**
- "Develop flexible composing processes including **multiple drafts** and **substantive revision**"
- Evidence: Tracked changes showing global revision, not just editing

**Outcome 6: Reflection and Metacognition**
- "Reflect on composing choices and **revise based on feedback**"
- Evidence: Reflective one-pagers citing specific feedback and explaining revision decisions

**Outcome 7: Process Documentation**
- "Document writing workflows and **revision decisions**"
- Evidence: Dev logs showing when/why revisions happened

**Why this matters**: You can't demonstrate these outcomes without evidence of revision.

#### 3. Portfolio Itself Is Revision at Scale

**Portfolio assembly is revision**:
- Select 4-6 pieces from 40-50 fragments (curation = revision decision)
- Polish selected pieces (final revision cycle)
- Organize and connect pieces (structural revision)
- Write cover letter arguing for grade (framing = revision)

**Why this matters**: Portfolio shows you can revise not just individual pieces but entire collections of work.

## What Counts as Revision

### Substantive vs. Surface Revision

This course distinguishes between two types of revision:

#### Surface Revision (necessary but not sufficient)

**What it includes**:
- Fixing typos and grammar errors
- Correcting citation format
- Adjusting word choice
- Polishing sentences

**Why it matters**:
- Professional writing requires correctness
- Conventions affect credibility
- Editing is important finishing work

**But**:
- Surface revision alone doesn't earn full "revision credit"
- Proofreading is expected, not exceptional

#### Substantive Revision (what earns credit)

**What it includes**:
- **Rethinking structure**: Reorganizing paragraphs or sections
- **Revising claims**: Changing your argument based on new insights
- **Adding evidence**: Including new examples or quotations
- **Cutting content**: Removing sections that don't serve purpose
- **Reframing**: Changing how you introduce or contextualize ideas
- **Audience adjustment**: Revising for different readers' needs

**Example of substantive revision**:
- **Before**: "Reading is important because it teaches you things."
- **After**: "My elementary school librarian, Mrs. Chen, taught me that reading wasn't about extracting facts from texts but about having conversations with authors across time. When I checked out *The Phantom Tollbooth* in third grade, she asked not 'What did you learn?' but 'What did Milo learn—and do you agree with him?' This distinction—between reading as information transfer and reading as dialogue—transformed how I approach texts."

**Why it's substantive**: This revision adds concrete narrative evidence (Mrs. Chen, specific book), develops the claim (reading as dialogue vs. information transfer), and shows rather than tells the importance of reading.

**Justification**: [[revision-credit-reasons-v101#Substantive vs Surface|Why this distinction?]]

## Revision Timeline

### When Revision Happens

Revision is embedded throughout the semester, not isolated to specific "revision weeks":

#### Ongoing Micro-Revisions (Weekly)

**Fragments**:
- Write fragment (200-300 words)
- Reread next day, make quick revisions
- Save revised version with new status tag

**Time investment**: 5-10 minutes per fragment

**Why this matters**: Daily practice builds revision habits

#### Structured Revision Cycles (Every 2-3 weeks)

**Eli Review cycles**:
- **Week 1**: Submit draft to Eli Review
- **Week 1**: Receive peer feedback (2-3 reviewers)
- **Week 2**: Revise based on feedback
- **Week 2**: Submit revision to Eli
- **Week 2**: Complete reflective one-pager documenting changes

**Time investment**: 2-4 hours per cycle (includes reading feedback, revising, reflection)

**Six cycles total**: Weeks 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 14

#### Portfolio Revision (Weeks 12-15)

**Final revision stage**:
- Select 4-6 pieces from accumulated fragments
- Review all feedback received on these pieces
- Make final substantive revisions
- Polish for conventions and presentation
- Write cover letter synthesizing revision journey

**Time investment**: 8-12 hours (spread across 4 weeks)

**Why this matters**: Portfolio preparation is where revision becomes curation and synthesis

**Justification**: [[revision-credit-reasons-v101#Timeline Design|Why this pacing?]]

## Assessment Criteria

### How Revision Is Evaluated

Revision credit is assessed on three dimensions:

#### Engagement with Feedback (40%)

**Strong**:
- Cites specific peer/instructor comments
- Responds to multiple reviewers' suggestions
- Shows discrimination (uses helpful feedback, explains why some suggestions didn't fit)
- Reflective one-pagers quote actual feedback received

**Developing**:
- Acknowledges feedback generally ("my reviewers said...")
- Responds to some suggestions
- May not explain decisions about what to use/ignore

**Weak**:
- Generic mention of feedback ("I got feedback and revised")
- Doesn't cite specific comments
- Unclear whether/how feedback informed changes

#### Substantiveness of Changes (40%)

**Strong**:
- Global revisions (structure, claims, evidence)
- Addition or removal of substantial content
- Rethinking, not just editing
- Tracked changes show significant evolution

**Developing**:
- Mix of surface and substantive changes
- Some structural revision
- May focus heavily on sentence-level improvements

**Weak**:
- Primarily surface-level (typos, word choice)
- Minimal content changes
- Revision feels like proofreading

#### Metacognitive Awareness (20%)

**Strong**:
- Articulates *why* changes improve the writing
- Connects revision decisions to rhetorical principles
- Shows learning from the revision process
- Reflective one-pagers demonstrate insight

**Developing**:
- Describes changes made
- May not explain reasoning
- Some awareness of rhetorical principles

**Weak**:
- Lists changes without explanation
- Doesn't connect revisions to learning
- Generic reflection ("I made it better")

**Justification**: [[revision-credit-reasons-v101#Evaluation Criteria|Why these weights?]]

## Student Support

### Resources for Effective Revision

**Provided materials**:
- Week 3 workshop: "What Makes Feedback Helpful?"
- Week 5: Revision checklist (global → local questions)
- Week 9: Example annotated revisions showing tracked changes
- Week 12: Portfolio revision planning worksheet

**Office hours support**:
- Weeks 6-7: Revision consultations after first Eli cycle
- Weeks 10-11: Mid-semester revision check-ins
- Weeks 13-14: Portfolio revision support

**Peer support**:
- In-class revision workshops (Weeks 6, 9, 12)
- Optional peer revision groups (self-organized)

### Common Questions

**Q**: "How much should I revise?"
**A**: Enough to make substantive changes in response to feedback. If reviewers said "add more evidence," adding one example might not be enough. If they said "structure is confusing," you may need to reorganize significantly. Let the feedback guide the scope.

**Q**: "What if I disagree with feedback?"
**A**: You're not required to use all feedback. In your reflective one-pager, explain: "Reviewer X suggested [change], but I chose not to because [reason]." Thoughtful rejection of feedback shows critical thinking.

**Q**: "Can I revise portfolio pieces after the deadline?"
**A**: No. Portfolio submission is final. However, you have Weeks 13-14 to revise and polish before submitting, and office hours are available for consultation during this time.

**Q**: "Do revisions need to be tracked?"
**A**: For portfolio pieces that you're showcasing revision on, yes—include version history. For weekly fragments, revision tracking is optional but recommended for your own process awareness.

**Q**: "What if my revision makes the piece worse?"
**A**: That's a learning opportunity. Document in your dev log: "Tried restructuring with narrative first, but it didn't work because [reason]. Reverted to original structure." Failed experiments show intellectual risk-taking.
