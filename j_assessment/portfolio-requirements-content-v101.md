**See**: [[reflective-cover-letter-content-v101|Detailed guidelines]]

**Justification**: [[portfolio-requirements-reasons-v101#Reflective Cover Letter|Why this matters]]

---

### 2. Polished Final Pieces (2-3 Required)

**What counts**: Substantial revised writing that demonstrates your best work.

**Selection criteria**:
- Each piece 1,500-2,500 words (shorter fragments can be combined/expanded)
- Each piece revised through at least 2 peer review cycles
- Collectively address multiple course outcomes (not all outcomes in each piece)
- Show range (don't submit 3 pieces all doing the same thing)

**Options for what to include**:

**Traditional polished pieces**:
- Expanded constraint experiment (from M1)
- Rhetorical analysis essay (analyzing course readings or constraint sequences)
- Synthesis piece connecting multiple course readings
- Research-based argument using BEAM portfolio work

**Alternative polished pieces**:
- Spec document for a writing project (analyzed constraints, requirements, success criteria)
- README documentation for your portfolio (explaining organization and navigation)
- Process narrative analyzing your writing development across semester
- Constraint audit of a published text with revision recommendations

**You may combine**:
- Multiple related fragments revised into coherent essay
- Fragment + expansion through research
- Two fragments connected through synthesis

**Justification**: [[portfolio-requirements-reasons-v101#Polished Pieces Selection|Why these options?]]

---

### 3. Process Evidence (Required for Each Polished Piece)

**What to include for each polished piece**:

**Drafts showing revision**:
- At least 2 substantive drafts (not just surface edits)
- Clear version naming: `title-draft1.docx`, `title-draft2-revised.docx`
- Visible changes between drafts (additions, reorganization, reconceptualization)

**Peer feedback received**:
- Screenshots or exports from Eli Review showing feedback you got
- Highlight which comments you acted on
- Brief annotation: "This comment made me realize..."

**Your revision notes**:
- Can be margin comments in Word
- Can be separate document: "Changes I made and why"
- Should show decision-making, not just description

**Example process folder for one polished piece**:
```
Polished-Piece-1-Salvatori-Analysis/
├── salvatori-draft1.docx
├── salvatori-draft2-post-peer-review.docx
├── salvatori-final.docx
├── peer-feedback-received.pdf (from Eli)
├── revision-notes.docx
```

**Justification**: [[portfolio-requirements-reasons-v101#Process Evidence Purpose|Why include drafts?]]

---

### 4. Process Archaeology (Required)

**What to include**:

**Dev logs** (all entries from semester):
- Compile into single document or keep separate
- Chronological order
- Should total 12-15 entries across semester
- Show development of your process awareness

**System map** (revised final version):
- Visual diagram of your writing workflow
- Should reflect your actual process by semester's end
- Include annotations explaining evolution ("Early in semester I... but now I...")

**Optional additions**:
- Screenshots of your OneDrive folder structure
- Photos of your index card organization system
- Examples of your Zotero library organization
- "Then vs. Now" comparison showing process evolution

**Purpose**: This section makes your invisible labor visible. It shows how you work, what you've learned about your process, and how your approach evolved across the semester.

**Justification**: [[portfolio-requirements-reasons-v101#Process Archaeology Rationale|Why document process?]]

```
ENGL101-Portfolio-YourName/
├── 00-Cover-Letter.docx
├── 01-Polished-Pieces/
│   ├── Piece1-Title/
│   │   ├── final.docx
│   │   └── process-evidence/
│   ├── Piece2-Title/
│   └── Piece3-Title/

## What Makes a Strong Portfolio

### Strong Portfolios Demonstrate:

**1. Substantive revision**
- Drafts show genuine reconceptualization, not just editing
- Evidence of multiple revision cycles responding to feedback
- Risk-taking that led to meaningful improvements

**2. Metacognitive awareness**
- Cover letter makes explicit claims about learning
- Process archaeology shows evolving understanding of your writing process
- Connections between early struggles and later solutions

**3. Outcome achievement**
- Clear evidence for each of the 7 learning outcomes
- Polished pieces demonstrate multiple outcomes
- Cover letter argues convincingly with specific evidence

**4. Professional presentation**
- Well-organized folder structure
- Clear file naming
- Readable formatting
- Careful proofreading of final pieces

**5. Process sophistication**
- Dev logs show increasing process awareness
- System map reflects thoughtful workflow
- Evidence of learning from difficulty (failure-as-diagnostic)

### Common Weaknesses to Avoid:

**Superficial revision**:
- ❌ Drafts differ only in surface corrections
- ✅ Drafts show reconceptualization, reorganization, new development

**Generic reflection**:
- ❌ "I learned a lot this semester"
- ✅ "When Sarah's peer feedback pointed out that my evidence didn't support my claim in paragraph 3, I realized..."

**Missing process evidence**:
- ❌ Submit final piece without drafts
- ✅ Include minimum 2 substantive drafts with peer feedback

**Poor organization**:
- ❌ All files dumped in one folder with unclear names
- ✅ Organized structure with descriptive naming

**Cover letter doesn't argue**:
- ❌ Summarize what you did
- ✅ Argue for your grade with evidence from portfolio

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I include work from other classes?

**No.** Portfolio must contain only work produced for this course. However, you may:
- Write about topics from other courses
- Use research from other courses as sources
- Apply concepts from this course to analyze writing from other courses

### What if I didn't save my early drafts?

**Problematic.** Process evidence is required. Options:
- Use what you have and explain the gap in your cover letter
- Reconstruct early thinking using dev logs
- This is why we emphasized file organization all semester

**Prevention**: Use OneDrive version history to recover earlier versions if needed.

### Can I revise work that got low grades earlier?

**Yes!** Portfolio is about your best work. Revising earlier struggles shows growth. Include in process evidence:
- Original version with instructor feedback
- Revised version responding to feedback
- Reflection on what you learned through revision

### Do all polished pieces need to be "academic essays"?

**No.** See alternative options above (spec documents, READMEs, process narratives). What matters:
- Substantial length (1,500-2,500 words)
- Demonstrates outcomes
- Shows evidence of revision
- Polished and professional

### How long should my cover letter be?

**1,200-1,500 words**. Shorter feels rushed; longer risks losing focus. Quality of evidence matters more than length.

### What if I can't find evidence for all 7 outcomes?

**Talk to me immediately.** Every portfolio should demonstrate all outcomes. If you can't find evidence:
- You may need to revise a piece to demonstrate missing outcome
- You may not have recognized evidence you already have
- Week 12 portfolio preview can help identify gaps
