## Overview

Your portfolio's **reflective cover letter** is where you make an evidence-based argument for your final grade. This isn't a generic reflection—it's a persuasive document that demonstrates how you've met the course's seven learning outcomes and explains what grade you believe your work deserves.

**Length**: 1,500-2,000 words

**Due**: With portfolio submission (finals week)

**Weight**: Assessed as part of portfolio holistic evaluation (see [[portfolio-rubric-course-v101|Portfolio Rubric]])

**Justification**: [[reflective-cover-letter-reasons-v101#Purpose|Why this assignment?]]

## What This Letter Does

### Primary Functions

**1. Makes Your Case**
You argue for a specific grade based on documented evidence from your portfolio. This is persuasive writing—you're convincing me that your work demonstrates achievement of course outcomes.

**2. Demonstrates Metacognition**
You reflect on your learning process, identifying moments of growth, struggle, and transfer. This shows you understand not just *what* you learned but *how* you learned it.

**3. Connects Evidence to Outcomes**
You explicitly link portfolio pieces to the seven course learning outcomes, explaining how specific work demonstrates specific competencies.

**4. Documents Your Process**
You use dev logs, peer feedback, and revision histories to show your writing evolution across the semester.

**Justification**: [[reflective-cover-letter-reasons-v101#Metacognitive Function|Why metacognition matters]]

## Required Components

Your cover letter must address all seven elements below:

### 1. Introduction: Your Argument (150-200 words)

**What to include**:
- Clear thesis: "I believe I have earned a grade of [X] because..."
- Brief overview of your strongest evidence
- Preview of how you'll organize your argument

**Example opening**:
> "I believe I have earned a B+ in this course because my portfolio demonstrates consistent engagement with writing processes, substantial revision based on peer feedback, and growing command of rhetorical awareness. While my early fragments show struggles with developing claims, my dev logs document how I learned to use constraints strategically, and my polished pieces demonstrate the iterative revision this course values."

### 2. Outcome-by-Outcome Analysis (900-1,200 words)

For **each of the seven course learning outcomes**, provide:

**Statement of the outcome** (quoted from syllabus)

**Your self-assessment**: Have you met this outcome? Exceeded it? Still developing?

**Specific evidence**: Which portfolio pieces demonstrate this outcome? Quote or reference specific passages.

**Process documentation**: What do your dev logs or peer feedback show about developing this competency?

**Example for Outcome 1 (Rhetorical Awareness)**:
> "Outcome 1 states that students will 'analyze rhetorical situations and make strategic choices based on audience, purpose, and context.' I believe I have **met and exceeded** this outcome. My spec document for the constraint experiment (included as polished piece #2) demonstrates sophisticated audience analysis—I explicitly identified three reader types (skeptical peer, supportive instructor, future self) and tailored my explanation accordingly. My dev log from Week 7 shows the moment I realized that 'writing for my future self' required different moves than writing for peer review, and this insight carried forward into my literacy narrative revision."

**Repeat this structure for all seven outcomes** (each outcome analysis: ~130-170 words)

### 3. Process Evolution (300-400 words)

**What to include**:
- How your writing process changed across the semester
- Specific examples from dev logs showing growth
- Constraints you learned to use strategically
- How accumulation model affected your approach

**Guiding questions**:
- What surprised you about daily writing?
- How did your relationship to revision change?
- What role did peer feedback play in your process?
- Which constraints were productive vs. restrictive?

**Example**:
> "At the semester's start, I treated fragments as isolated exercises—complete them, submit them, move on. My Week 3 dev log shows frustration: 'These fragments feel pointless. Why can't we just write essays?' By Week 8, my perspective had shifted. After the 'What You're Automating' session, I started seeing fragments as building blocks rather than busywork. My dev log from Week 9 documents experimenting with remixing three early fragments into a new piece, and that's when accumulation clicked—I had a corpus to work with, not just separate assignments."

### 4. Revision Documentation (200-300 words)

**What to include**:
- Specific examples of substantive revision (not just editing)
- How you responded to peer feedback
- Citations from your reflective one-pagers showing revision decisions

**Example**:
> "My most significant revision came in response to peer feedback on my literacy narrative draft. Three reviewers noted that my opening 'stated the claim without earning it through storytelling.' Their feedback pushed me to add the elementary school library scene that now opens the piece. My reflective one-pager from Week 6 documents this decision: 'I was trying to argue my way into the reader's trust instead of narrating my way there.' This shift from argument-first to narrative-first transformed the entire piece."

### 5. Challenges & Failures (150-250 words)

**What to include**:
- Moments when writing was difficult (and what you learned)
- Experiments that didn't work (and why)
- Constraints you struggled with (and how you adapted)

**Why this matters**: Difficulty is diagnostic. Showing you can learn from failure demonstrates metacognition.

**Example**:
> "The BEAM portfolio assignment defeated me initially. My Week 10 dev log captures my confusion: 'I don't understand how one source can be both Background and Exhibit—aren't those contradictory?' It took three peer review cycles and an office hours conversation before I realized BEAM describes *how* sources function, not *what* they are intrinsically. My dev log from Week 12 shows the breakthrough: 'A source isn't Background OR Exhibit—it's Background when I use it one way, Exhibit when I use it differently.' This distinction now structures how I read sources."

### 6. Transfer Potential (150-200 words)

**What to include**:
- What from this course you'll use in other contexts
- How constraints, dev logs, or accumulation might transfer
- Specific habits or practices you plan to continue

**Example**:
> "The dev log practice transfers directly to other contexts. I'm already using modified dev logs in my biology lab course to track experimental decisions and surprises. The three-part structure (Did / Happened / Learned) helps me identify patterns in my thinking. Similarly, the habit of accumulating small pieces before attempting larger synthesis will inform my research writing—I can see collecting index cards of reading notes throughout a project rather than trying to remember everything when drafting."

### 7. Conclusion: Return to Your Argument (100-150 words)

**What to include**:
- Restate your grade claim
- Synthesize your strongest evidence
- Acknowledge limitations while affirming achievements

**Example**:
> "Based on this evidence—consistent fragment accumulation, documented revision in response to feedback, and demonstrated command of all seven outcomes—I believe I have earned a B+ in this course. My work shows the sustained engagement and competent execution that the grading policy defines as B-range, and my portfolio's polished pieces demonstrate rhetorical awareness and process documentation that exceed baseline expectations. While I struggled with some constraints and my early work was uneven, my dev logs show learning from difficulty, and my revisions demonstrate the iterative thinking this course values."

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### ❌ Generic Reflection

**Don't write**: "This class taught me a lot about writing. I grew as a writer."

**Do write**: "My Week 7 dev log documents the moment I realized constraints weren't restrictions but prompts—this insight transformed how I approached the spec document."

### ❌ Unsupported Claims

**Don't write**: "I met Outcome 3 because I'm good at rhetorical awareness."

**Do write**: "I met Outcome 3, as demonstrated in my constraint experiment spec document where I analyzed three distinct audiences and tailored my explanation accordingly (see pp. 2-4)."

### ❌ Summary Instead of Argument

**Don't write**: "First I wrote fragments. Then I did peer review. Then I made my portfolio."

**Do write**: "Fragment accumulation enabled revision at scale—by Week 10 I had 30+ pieces to choose from, allowing me to select the six that best demonstrated outcome achievement."

### ❌ Grade Inflation Without Evidence

**Don't write**: "I deserve an A because I worked really hard."

**Do write**: "I believe I earned a B+ because my portfolio shows consistent engagement (50/50 fragments completed) and substantive revision (see tracked changes in literacy narrative), which the grading policy defines as B-range work."

### ❌ Ignoring Challenges

**Don't write**: "Everything went smoothly and I had no problems."

**Do write**: "The BEAM portfolio confused me initially (Week 10 dev log shows my struggle), but working through that confusion taught me how sources function rhetorically."

**Justification**: [[reflective-cover-letter-reasons-v101#Common Mistakes|Why these matter]]

## Student Support

### Resources Provided

**Week 12 handout**: Cover letter planning worksheet (maps outcomes to evidence)

**Week 13 example**: Annotated sample cover letter showing strong outcome analysis

**Week 14 office hours**: Cover letter consultations available

**Week 15**: Peer review opportunity (optional, ungraded)

### Common Questions

**Q**: "Can I argue for a higher grade than my formative work suggests?"
**A**: Yes. The portfolio is 50% of your grade, so exceptional portfolio work can raise your final grade significantly. However, your argument needs evidence—show me the work that demonstrates higher achievement.

**Q**: "What if I don't think I met all seven outcomes?"
**A**: Honest self-assessment is valued. You can acknowledge developing competencies while still arguing you met course expectations overall. "I'm still developing X, but I've met/exceeded Y and Z" is a legitimate argument.

**Q**: "Should I write this in first person?"
**A**: Yes. This is reflective writing—"I," "my," and "me" are appropriate and expected.

**Q**: "How much should I quote from my portfolio pieces?"
**A**: Quote enough to provide specific evidence (2-3 sentences per outcome analysis), but don't reproduce entire paragraphs. Point me to the work and explain what it demonstrates.

**Q**: "Can I revise this after submitting?"
**A**: No. The cover letter is submitted with your final portfolio and cannot be revised after the deadline. Budget time for drafting and polishing.
