## Design Philosophy

### Core Pedagogical Principle

Portfolio assessment operationalizes the course's commitment to **writing as both verb and noun**: students must demonstrate both the **processes they engaged in** (writing-as-labor) and the **products they produced** (writing-as-capital). The portfolio structure honors:

1. **Revision as central to learning** (multiple drafts required)
2. **Metacognition as evidence of transfer** (reflective cover letter)
3. **Process documentation as valuable work** (dev logs, system maps count)
4. **Student agency in curation** (they select what to showcase)

### Theoretical Grounding

**Key Sources:**
- Yancey, Kathleen Blake. *Reflection in the Writing Classroom*. Utah State UP, 1998.
- White, Edward M. "The Scoring of Writing Portfolios: Phase 2." *College Composition and Communication* 56.4 (2005): 581-600.
- Broad, Bob. *What We Really Value: Beyond Rubrics in Teaching and Assessing Writing*. Utah State UP, 2003.
- Sommers, Nancy. "Revision Strategies of Student Writers and Experienced Adult Writers." *College Composition and Communication* 31.4 (1980): 378-388.

**Concepts Applied:**
- **Reflective transfer**: Yancey's argument that reflection enables students to carry forward learning
- **Portfolio validity**: White's framework for what makes portfolio assessment meaningful
- **Dynamic criteria**: Broad's emphasis on making values explicit while allowing flexibility
- **Substantive revision**: Sommers' distinction between surface editing and reconceptualization

## Component Justifications

### Reflective Cover Letter: Metacognitive Centerpiece

**Why require a cover letter?**

The reflective cover letter is **not an afterthought**—it's the intellectual center of the portfolio. Research on learning transfer shows that students who can articulate what they learned and how they learned it are more likely to apply that knowledge in new contexts (Beaufort 2007, Wardle 2009).

**What makes it different from traditional reflection?**

Traditional reflection prompts ask: "What did you learn?"

VIRENS cover letter asks: "What evidence from your portfolio proves you achieved course outcomes?"

This shifts from **summarizing experience** to **arguing with evidence**, which requires:
- Careful selection of portfolio pieces
- Close reading of own work
- Metacognitive analysis of process development
- Rhetorical awareness (arguing to an audience for a grade)

**Length rationale (1,200-1,500 words)**:

- **Too short (<1,000 words)**: Can't adequately address 7 outcomes with evidence
- **Too long (>2,000 words)**: Loses focus, becomes unwieldy
- **1,200-1,500 optimal**: ~170 words per outcome + intro/conclusion

**Research support**:
- Yancey (1998): Reflection must be structured and substantive to produce learning
- Dryer et al. (2014): "Teaching Enculturation" framework shows reflection enables transfer
- Nowacek (2011): Students who articulate connections across contexts show better transfer

### Polished Final Pieces: Demonstrating Outcomes in Practice

**Why 2-3 pieces (not 1 or 5)?**

**Too few (1 piece)**:
- Can't show range across outcomes
- Single piece too high-stakes
- Doesn't demonstrate versatility

**Too many (4-5 pieces)**:
- Overwhelms assessment (grader fatigue)
- Encourages breadth over depth
- Time constraints make deep revision unlikely

**2-3 pieces optimal**:
- Shows range without overwhelming
- Allows deep revision on each piece
- Manageable for end-of-semester workload
- Aligns with White's (2005) portfolio research on optimal size

**Why 1,500-2,500 words per piece?**

Based on first-year writing research and practical constraints:
- **Minimum 1,500**: Long enough to develop complex ideas, show rhetorical sophistication
- **Maximum 2,500**: Manageable for revision, readable for assessment, achievable given time
- **Total ~4,500-7,500 words**: Substantial but not overwhelming

Students can combine shorter fragments (300-400 words each) into longer polished pieces, which operationalizes the course's accumulation model.

**Alternative polished pieces (spec docs, READMEs, process narratives)**:

Traditional "academic essay" isn't the only way to demonstrate outcomes. Alternative genres:
- **Spec documents**: Demonstrate rhetorical awareness, constraint analysis, audience consideration
- **READMEs**: Show ability to write for real audience (someone navigating the portfolio)
- **Process narratives**: Demonstrate metacognitive awareness, reflection, analytical thinking

This flexibility honors the course's emphasis on genre awareness while maintaining rigor.

**Research support**:
- Wardle & Downs (2014): Writing About Writing approach validates non-traditional genres
- Devitt (2004): Genre awareness develops through analysis and production of multiple genres
- Carroll (2002): Transfer occurs when students understand rhetorical principles, not just practice essay form

---

### Process Evidence: Making Revision Visible

**Why require drafts, not just final pieces?**

Traditional portfolios showcase **products**. VIRENS portfolios showcase **processes**.

**Problem**: Students claim "I revised a lot" but can't prove it.

**Solution**: Process evidence makes revision visible and assessable.

**What counts as substantive revision?**

Following Sommers (1980), revision must show:
- **Reconceptualization**: Changed thinking, not just better sentences
- **Reorganization**: Structural changes, not just moved paragraphs
- **New development**: Added ideas/evidence, not just polished existing

**Surface editing ≠ revision**:
- Fixing typos, improving word choice, correcting citations = editing
- Changing argument, adding evidence, reorganizing structure = revision

**Why require peer feedback as evidence?**

Shows revision was **responsive**, not just random changes:
- Student received specific feedback
- Student engaged with that feedback (annotated it)
- Student made revision decisions based on feedback
- Creates accountability for peer review participation

**Research support**:
- Sommers (1980): Experienced writers revise for meaning; novices edit for correctness
- Faigley & Witte (1981): Distinguish surface-level from meaning-level revision
- Beach & Friedrich (2006): Peer feedback most effective when students document responses

---

### Process Archaeology: Honoring Invisible Labor

**Why include dev logs and system maps?**

Traditional portfolios showcase **polished products**. This makes writing look easy, natural, inevitable—erasing the labor.

VIRENS portfolios include **process archaeology**: evidence of the messy, difficult, recursive work.

**Dev logs serve dual purpose**:
1. **Formative**: Help students improve their processes during semester
2. **Summative**: Provide evidence of metacognitive growth for portfolio

**System maps serve dual purpose**:
1. **Functional**: Help students organize their workflow
2. **Reflective**: Document evolution of their process understanding

**"Then vs. Now" comparison**:

Students annotate their system map: "Early in semester I wrote fragments the night before class, but by M3 I had established a weekly rhythm..."

This shows **process as learned skill**, not innate talent.

**Why this matters pedagogically**:

Students often believe:
- "Good writers don't struggle" (false)
- "Writing should flow naturally" (false)
- "Difficulty means I'm a bad writer" (false)

Process archaeology provides evidence:
- Everyone struggles
- Process sophistication develops over time
- Difficulty is diagnostic (provides information about what to work on)

**Research support**:
- Perl (1979): Writing process involves recursion, not linear stages
- Flower & Hayes (1981): Expert writers have explicit process knowledge
- Rose (1984): "Writer's block" often results from rigid, inefficient processes
- Schön (1983): Reflective practitioners articulate their processes

## Portfolio Structure Decisions

### Why Digital Portfolio (Not Print)?

**Advantages of digital**:
- Students already working in OneDrive/Word (no format shift)
- Version history available for checking drafts
- Easier to organize/navigate with folder structure
- Environmentally responsible (no printing 6,000-8,000 words × 24 students)
- Easier to store/archive

**Potential disadvantages**:
- Technology access issues (mitigated: all students have campus OneDrive)
- File format inconsistencies (mitigated: .docx required)
- Navigation can be unclear (mitigated: required folder structure)

**Alternative considered: Physical portfolio**
- **Rejected because**: Expensive to print, difficult to transport, harder to organize process evidence (how do you include Eli screenshots in print portfolio?)

**Alternative considered: Web-based portfolio (Google Sites, Wix)**
- **Rejected because**: Adds technology learning curve, not all students have web design experience, creates equity issues (whose portfolio looks "better" based on tech skills vs. writing quality)

---

### Why No Late Penalty on Portfolio?

Portfolio is **summative assessment**, different purpose than formative work:

**Formative work** (fragments, peer review):
- Timeliness matters (disrupts cycles if late)
- Collaborative (peer review depends on everyone submitting)
- Ongoing accountability

**Portfolio** (summative):
- End-of-semester deadline (students have time to plan)
- Individual work (doesn't affect others if late)
- Assessed on quality, not timeliness

**However**: Extensions require **official accommodations** (documented through DSU or similar).

**Why this matters**: 
- Reduces last-week panic
- Allows flexibility for students managing finals
- Maintains standards (still has deadline, just no penalty cascade)

---

### Organization Requirements: Pedagogical Purpose

**Why mandate folder structure?**

Not just convenience—it teaches:
- **Information architecture**: How to organize content for navigation
- **Audience awareness**: Someone else needs to find things
- **Documentation practices**: Professional standards for file organization

**Why file naming conventions?**

Teaches transferable skills:
- No spaces (breaks some systems)
- Descriptive names (enables search, supports memory)
- Version indicators (tracks development)

These are **real-world practices** (software development, professional writing, archival work).

Students who learn "ENGL101-Portfolio-YourName" structure can adapt it to:
- "JobApplications-2026-Smith"
- "Senior-Thesis-Chemistry-Jones"
- Professional project documentation

---

## Selection and Curation

### Student Agency in Choosing Pieces

**Why not assign "include your rhetorical analysis and your synthesis essay"?**

**Traditional approach** (instructor-selected):
- Ensures outcome coverage
- Creates uniformity across portfolios
- Easier to assess (comparing apples to apples)

**VIRENS approach** (student-selected):
- Honors student agency
- Recognizes students know their own best work
- Creates buy-in (students invested in self-selected pieces)
- Reflects real-world portfolio practice (no one tells professionals what to include)

**How to ensure outcome coverage with student selection?**

**Cover letter requirement**: Students must argue they've demonstrated all 7 outcomes using their selected pieces. If they can't find evidence for an outcome, they:
- Revise a piece to demonstrate missing outcome, or
- Recognize gap in their learning (valuable metacognitive moment)

**Portfolio preview conferences** (Week 12): Instructor can flag if selections won't cover outcomes

---

### Range Requirement: Avoiding Repetition

**Why require "show range" across pieces?**

**Problem**: Students might submit 3 pieces all doing same thing (e.g., three rhetorical analyses).

**Solution**: "Show range" means demonstrate versatility:
- Different genres (essay, spec doc, README)
- Different purposes (analyze, synthesize, argue, document)
- Different audiences (academic, peer, general public)

This operationalizes **rhetorical awareness outcome**: effective writers adapt to different situations.

---

## Timeline and Scaffolding

### Why Start Portfolio Discussion in Week 12?

**Too early (Week 8)**:
- Students don't have enough work to select from
- Can't yet see patterns/growth
- Feels distant and abstract

**Too late (Week 15)**:
- No time for substantive revision
- Panic mode (throws together whatever)
- Can't address gaps in outcome coverage

**Week 12 optimal**:
- Students have ~35-40 fragments to choose from
- Can see which threads are strongest
- 3 weeks to revise (Week 13, 14, 15)
- Time to address gaps if identified

### Week 13 Assembly Workshop: Why In-Class Time?

Portfolio assembly is **complex intellectual work**, not just housekeeping:
- Requires reviewing entire semester's work
- Involves difficult selection decisions
- Benefits from peer consultation

**In-class workshop provides**:
- Dedicated time (prevents procrastination)
- Peer feedback on selections ("Which of these two pieces shows more growth?")
- Instructor troubleshooting (navigation help, technical issues)
- Normalizes difficulty (everyone struggles with curation)

## Evidence & Iteration

### Evidence to Collect

**Portfolio quality indicators**:
- [ ] Do cover letters argue with specific evidence?
- [ ] Do drafts show substantive revision (not just editing)?
- [ ] Do process archaeology sections show development over time?
- [ ] Is folder organization clear and navigable?

**Student learning indicators**:
- [ ] Can students articulate what they learned in cover letters?
- [ ] Do portfolios show connections between early fragments and final pieces?
- [ ] Is there evidence of "failure-as-diagnostic" (learning from difficulty)?

**Assessment validity**:
- [ ] Does portfolio assessment align with course outcomes?
- [ ] Can outcomes be fairly assessed across different portfolio selections?
- [ ] Do rubrics capture what we value?

### Revision Notes

Based on piloting, consider:
- **Cover letter length**: If students struggle with 1,200-1,500, reduce to 1,000-1,200
- **Number of polished pieces**: If 3 feels too much, make it 2 required + 1 optional
- **Process evidence**: If students don't have drafts, allow reconstruction with explanation
- **Alternative formats**: If READMEs too unfamiliar, provide more models
