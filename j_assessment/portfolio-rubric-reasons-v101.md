## Design Philosophy

### Core Pedagogical Principle

The portfolio rubric operationalizes **holistic assessment** that values both **products and processes** while maintaining alignment with **course learning outcomes**. Key design principles:

1. **Criterion-referenced**: Students assessed against outcomes, not each other
2. **Holistic**: Outcomes assessed across entire portfolio, not piece-by-piece
3. **Process-inclusive**: Revision, reflection, and documentation count as much as polished writing
4. **Metacognition-centered**: Cover letter argument is weighted heavily
5. **Flexible**: Multiple paths to demonstrating outcomes

### Theoretical Grounding

**Key Sources:**
- Broad, Bob. *What We Really Value: Beyond Rubrics in Teaching and Assessing Writing*. Utah State UP, 2003.
- Huot, Brian. *Re-articulating Writing Assessment for Teaching and Learning*. Utah State UP, 2002.
- White, Edward M. "The Scoring of Writing Portfolios: Phase 2." *College Composition and Communication* 56.4 (2005): 581-600.
- Yancey, Kathleen Blake. "Postmodernism, Palimpsest, and Portfolios: Theoretical Issues in the Representation of Student Work." *College Composition and Communication* 55.4 (2004): 738-761.

**Concepts Applied:**
- **Dynamic criteria** (Broad): Values emerge from practice, rubrics make them explicit
- **Validity framework** (Huot): Assessment must align with instruction and value what we teach
- **Portfolio scoring** (White): Holistic reading more valid than analytic point-counting
- **Representation theory** (Yancey): Portfolios represent learning, not just collect products

---

## Holistic Assessment Philosophy

### Why Holistic Rather Than Analytic?

**Analytic rubric approach** (rejected):
- Each polished piece graded separately
- Points assigned to specific criteria
- Total points = grade

**Problems with analytic approach**:
1. **Reductionism**: Writing quality not sum of discrete features
2. **Piece-by-piece grading**: Misses connections across portfolio
3. **Double-counting**: Same outcome demonstrated in multiple pieces
4. **Process invisibility**: Doesn't account for revision, dev logs, system maps

**Holistic rubric approach** (selected):
- Entire portfolio read as integrated whole
- Outcomes assessed across all components
- Process evidence weighted equally with products
- Cover letter argument considered

**Advantages of holistic approach**:
1. **Honors complexity**: Writing is more than checklist of features
2. **Values integration**: Connections across pieces matter
3. **Includes process**: Revision, reflection, documentation count
4. **Metacognition-centered**: Student's self-assessment considered

**Research support**:
- White (2005): Holistic scoring more reliable and valid for portfolios than point-counting
- Broad (2003): Writing quality emerges from interaction of features, not sum
- Huot (2002): Assessment must reflect complexity of writing, not reduce it

### How Holistic ≠ Impressionistic

**Common misconception**: "Holistic = vague, impressionistic, subjective"

**Reality**: Holistic assessment is **systematic** but **integrative**:

**Systematic components**:
- Clear outcome definitions (7 specific outcomes)
- Defined performance levels (Exceptional/Proficient/Developing/Limited)
- Consistent reading process (completeness check, holistic reading, outcome-by-outcome, overall grade)
- Evidence-based (rubric specifies what portfolio evidence to look for)

**Integrative approach**:
- Considers how components work together
- Values connections student makes in cover letter
- Accounts for growth trajectory
- Allows flexibility in how outcomes are demonstrated

**Analogy**: Holistic assessment is like judging a meal (how dishes work together, balance of flavors, presentation) rather than scoring each ingredient separately.

---

## Outcome-Based Assessment

### Why Outcome-by-Outcome Rubrics?

**Traditional rubric categories** (rejected):
- Content, Organization, Style, Mechanics
- Generic across assignments
- Don't align with course-specific learning

**Outcome-based rubrics** (selected):
- Each rubric tied to specific learning outcome
- Reflects what this course values
- Demonstrates outcomes alignment for program assessment

**Alignment principle**: Assessment criteria must match what we teach. If course foregrounds constraint awareness, rubric must assess constraint awareness (not generic "organization").

---

### Exceptional/Proficient/Developing/Limited Levels

**Why 4 levels (not 5 or 3)?**

**Too few (3 levels)**:
- Insufficient granularity
- Conflates strong-proficient with exceptional
- Hard to distinguish developing from limited

**Too many (5-6 levels)**:
- False precision
- Difficult to distinguish between adjacent levels
- Splitting hairs doesn't improve validity

**4 levels optimal**:
- **Exceptional**: Exceeds expectations, sophisticated achievement
- **Proficient**: Meets expectations, solid achievement
- **Developing**: Approaching expectations, inconsistent achievement
- **Limited**: Below expectations, minimal achievement

This maps cleanly to grade ranges:
- Exceptional = A-range (90-100%)
- Proficient = B-range (80-89%)
- Developing = C-range (70-79%)
- Limited = D-F range (below 70%)

---

### Rubric Language Choices

**Active, specific descriptors** rather than vague quality judgments:

**Vague (rejected)**:
- "Shows excellent rhetorical awareness"
- "Demonstrates good revision"
- "Adequate source integration"

**Specific (selected)**:
- "Cover letter explicitly analyzes rhetorical choices made"
- "Process evidence shows substantive revision across multiple cycles (reconceptualization, not just editing)"
- "Sources integrated rhetorically (not just cited for credibility)"

**Why this matters**:
- Students can self-assess using specific criteria
- Grading becomes more consistent across portfolios
- Feedback is actionable ("Here's what Exceptional looks like")

**Research support**:
- Andrade (2005): Specific rubric language improves student performance
- Panadero & Jonsson (2013): Rubrics most effective when criteria are transparent

---

## Process-Inclusive Assessment

### Why Process Evidence Counts Toward Grade

Traditional assessment: Only **final products** graded
VIRENS assessment: **Both process and product** graded

**Rationale**: If we value process (revision, reflection, documentation), we must **assess** process.

**What counts as process evidence**:
- Multiple drafts showing revision
- Peer feedback and documented response
- Dev logs showing process development
- System map showing workflow evolution

**How process evidence is weighted**:
Not separately (would create false division between process/product). Instead, process evidence **informs outcome ratings**:

**Outcome 3 (Composing Processes)**: Heavily weighted toward process evidence
**Outcome 6 (Collaboration)**: Requires process evidence (peer feedback engagement)
**Outcome 7 (Metacognition)**: Process archaeology essential

**Other outcomes**: Process evidence provides context for evaluating products

**Example**: Two students submit similar final essay. Student A's portfolio shows 3 substantive drafts responding to peer feedback. Student B's shows only minor editing. Student A earns higher rating on Outcome 3 and likely Outcome 6.

**Research support**:
- Sommers (1980): Revision (not first drafts) is where learning happens
- Beaufort (2007): Process awareness enables transfer
- Yancey (1998): Reflection transforms experience into learning

## Cover Letter Role in Assessment

### Why Cover Letter Is Heavily Weighted

The reflective cover letter serves **dual purpose**:
1. **Assessment artifact**: Evidence of Outcome 7 (metacognition)
2. **Assessment tool**: Helps evaluator understand portfolio

**As assessment artifact**:
- Demonstrates student's metacognitive awareness
- Shows ability to analyze own work
- Provides transfer language
- Evidences self-assessment capability

**As assessment tool**:
- Directs evaluator's attention to key portfolio evidence
- Makes student's argument for their achievement
- Helps evaluator understand connections across portfolio
- Provides context for design choices

**Analogy**: Cover letter is like expert testimony in a legal case—the expert (student) guides the jury (evaluator) through the evidence.

**Grading implication**: Weak cover letter makes it harder to see strong portfolio work. Strong cover letter highlights achievement and makes coherent argument.

**Research support**:
- Yancey (2004): Reflection makes learning visible and transferable
- Sommers (2006): Reflective writers develop more as writers
- Moore (2017): Reflective cover letters improve portfolio assessment validity

## Flexibility in Demonstrating Outcomes

### Multiple Paths to Achievement

**Design principle**: Students should be able to demonstrate outcomes through **different types of work**.

**Example—Outcome 1 (Rhetorical Awareness)**:

**Path A**: Traditional rhetorical analysis essay analyzing course reading
**Path B**: Spec document identifying constraints for writing project
**Path C**: README for portfolio demonstrating audience awareness

All three demonstrate rhetorical awareness, but through different genres and approaches.

**Why this matters**:
1. **Honors student agency**: Choice increases investment
2. **Reduces one-size-fits-all**: Different students have different strengths
3. **Reflects real-world**: Professionals demonstrate competence through varied work
4. **Aligns with outcome**: If outcome is "adapt to audience/genre," requiring one genre contradicts it

---

### Portfolio Diversity Requirement

**Why require "show range" across polished pieces?**

**Problem**: Without guidance, students might submit:
- 3 pieces all doing same thing (rhetorical analysis × 3)
- Similar genre/purpose/approach

**Solution**: "Show range" requirement encourages:
- Different genres (essay, spec doc, README, process narrative)
- Different purposes (analyze, synthesize, argue, document)
- Different rhetorical situations

**How this works with flexible paths**:
Students choose their own pieces BUT must demonstrate versatility across selections.

**Assessment consideration**: Evaluator looks for breadth of outcomes demonstrated across portfolio, not within single piece.

---

## Grade Distribution Philosophy

### Criterion-Referenced vs. Norm-Referenced

**Norm-referenced grading** (rejected):
- Grading on curve
- Students compete against each other
- Fixed percentage get A/B/C regardless of achievement

**Criterion-referenced grading** (selected):
- Grading against outcomes
- Students "compete" against standards
- Theoretically all could earn A if all meet Exceptional criteria

**Why criterion-referenced?**:
1. **Fairness**: Achievement judged against stated criteria, not classmates
2. **Transparency**: Students know what they need to do
3. **Aligns with outcomes**: Designed to measure specific learning
4. **Collaboration-friendly**: Students help each other without grade penalty

**Practical consideration**: While theoretically all students could earn A, grade distribution typically centers at B-range (82-87%) based on portfolio quality. This emerges from student work quality, not predetermined quotas.

---

### Holistic Adjustment (±5%)

**Why allow adjustment?**

**Rigid point-counting problem**:
- Student with all Proficient ratings = exactly 85%
- Ignores portfolio quality beyond outcome achievement

**Holistic adjustment allows**:
- Recognizing exceptional portfolio coherence
- Accounting for professional presentation
- Considering growth trajectory
- Rewarding sophisticated integration

**Constraints on adjustment**:
- Small range (±5% maximum)
- Must be justified based on stated criteria (presentation, coherence, evidence quality, growth)
- Cannot override fundamental outcome achievement (can't adjust Limited portfolio to Proficient)

**Example**: Student earns Proficient ratings averaging 84%, but portfolio shows:
- Exceptional organization and file naming
- Sophisticated connections across pieces in cover letter
- Visible growth from early to late semester
- Professional-quality presentation

**Result**: Adjusted to 88-89% (high B+)

**Why this is defensible**:
- Still criterion-based (adjustment based on stated criteria)
- Small enough to not override outcome ratings
- Honors aspects of quality not captured in outcome-by-outcome assessment

---

## Incomplete Portfolio Penalty

### Why Cap Incomplete Portfolios at 60%?

**Problem**: What if student submits excellent cover letter and one polished piece but missing process evidence?

**Traditional approach**: Grade what's there, ignore what's missing

**VIRENS approach**: Completeness is threshold requirement

**Rationale**:
1. **Portfolio is holistic**: Missing components prevent holistic assessment
2. **Process is required**: Can't demonstrate Outcome 3 without process evidence
3. **Fairness**: Students who complete all work shouldn't be compared to those who did partial work
4. **Prevents gaming**: Student couldn't submit just best piece and skip rest

**60% threshold** (D-range):
- Low enough to be significant penalty
- High enough to allow passing if other work is strong
- Signals "missing work is serious problem"

**What counts as incomplete**:
- Missing cover letter
- Fewer than 2 polished pieces
- No process evidence for polished pieces
- Missing dev logs or system map

**What's flexible**:
- Exact number of dev log entries (12-15 target, but 10 okay if substantial)
- Process evidence format (can be annotations rather than separate document)

## Evidence & Iteration

### Evidence to Collect

**Rubric validity**:
- [ ] Do outcome rubrics align with course instruction?
- [ ] Can evaluators consistently apply rubric criteria?
- [ ] Do rubric ratings predict student success in later courses?

**Portfolio quality**:
- [ ] Distribution of outcome ratings (are they all clustering at one level?)
- [ ] Correlation between cover letter quality and overall portfolio grade
- [ ] Inter-rater reliability (if portfolios graded by multiple evaluators)

**Student experience**:
- [ ] Do students find rubrics clear and helpful for self-assessment?
- [ ] Do students reference rubrics in cover letters?
- [ ] Do Week 12 portfolio preview conferences improve final portfolios?

### Revision Notes

Based on piloting, consider:
- **Rating levels**: If too many portfolios cluster at Developing/Proficient boundary, clarify descriptors
- **Outcome rubrics**: If some outcomes harder to assess, add more specific portfolio evidence examples
- **Holistic adjustment**: If adjustment used inconsistently, tighten criteria or eliminate
- **Incomplete threshold**: If 60% too harsh or too lenient, adjust
