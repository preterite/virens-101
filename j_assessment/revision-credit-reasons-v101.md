## Design Philosophy

### Core Principle

**Revision is not correction—it's discovery.** This course reframes revision from "fixing errors in a draft" to "using feedback and reflection to see your work differently and rethink your approach." Assessment structures must reward this intellectual labor explicitly, or students will default to surface-level editing.

The course dedicates **20% of the final grade** (highest formative component) to revision and feedback engagement, plus integrates revision evidence throughout portfolio assessment. This dual-location strategy ensures revision is valued as both process (formative) and product (portfolio).

### Theoretical Grounding

**Key Sources:**
- Sommers, Nancy. "Revision Strategies of Student Writers and Experienced Adult Writers." *College Composition and Communication* 31.4 (1980): 378-388.
- Brandt, Deborah. "Remembering Writing, Remembering Reading." *College Composition and Communication* 45.4 (1994): 459-479.
- Anson, Chris M. *The WAC Casebook: Scenes for Faculty Reflection and Program Development*. Oxford UP, 2002.
- Haswell, Richard H. "Minimal Marking." *College English* 45.6 (1983): 600-604.

**Concepts Applied:**
- **Revision as re-vision** (seeing anew) vs. editing (correcting errors)
- **Feedback responsiveness** as evidence of rhetorical flexibility
- **Metacognitive awareness** of revision decisions
- **Process documentation** making revision labor visible

---

## Core Principle

### Why Revision Matters

**Sommers (1980)** foundational research demonstrated that:

**Novice writers revise by**:
- Fixing individual words and phrases
- Correcting surface errors (grammar, spelling)
- Making changes that don't affect meaning
- Thinking of revision as "cleanup after drafting"

**Experienced writers revise by**:
- Rethinking purpose and audience
- Reorganizing structure globally
- Reconsidering claims and evidence
- Generating new insights through revision process

**The difference?** Experienced writers see revision as **recursive discovery**, not linear correction.

### How Traditional Assessment Undermines Revision

**Problem 1: Revision isn't rewarded**
- Traditional model: Draft → Grade → Final revision (optional)
- Students who revise extensively get same grade as students who don't
- No incentive to engage deeply with feedback

**Problem 2: Revision treated as punishment**
- "Revise this draft" feels like "your draft failed"
- Students resist revision because it signals inadequacy
- Revision becomes remedial, not generative

**Problem 3: Surface changes are easier to grade**
- Instructors can quickly check if typos are fixed
- Harder to assess whether student rethought structure
- Grading systems inadvertently reward surface revision

**VIRENS 101's solution**: Make revision visible, valuable, and assessable through multiple mechanisms that reward substantive rethinking.

## Feedback Component

### Why 20% Weight?

The Revision & Feedback component (20% of final grade) is the **highest-weighted formative component** for strategic reasons:

**1. Signals course values**
- 20% > Fragment Accumulation (15%)
- Message: **Using feedback to improve** matters more than **producing volume**
- Aligns with research showing feedback engagement predicts writing growth

**2. Reflects cognitive demand**
- Revision requires analysis, evaluation, synthesis
- Higher-order thinking than initial drafting
- Should carry commensurate grade weight

**3. Incentivizes engagement with Eli Review**
- Platform only valuable if students give/use feedback seriously
- 10% for peer review quality ensures investment
- Helpfulness ratings create accountability

**4. Values metacognitive reflection**
- 10% for reflective one-pagers rewards articulating decisions
- Forces students to think about thinking
- Primes transfer to other contexts

**Why split 10%/10% (peer review / reflections)?**
- Both components essential to revision learning
- Peer review = engaging with others' feedback (social dimension)
- Reflections = analyzing your own revision (metacognitive dimension)
- Equal weight honors both external and internal feedback loops

## Substantive vs Surface

### Why This Distinction?

**Research basis** (Sommers 1980, Haswell 1983):

**Surface revision has limited impact on writing quality**:
- Fixing typos improves presentation, not thinking
- Grammar corrections address symptoms, not causes
- Sentence-level polish necessary but not sufficient

**Substantive revision develops writing ability**:
- Rethinking structure teaches organizational thinking
- Reconsidering claims develops argumentation
- Adding/cutting evidence teaches critical evaluation
- Reframing for audience builds rhetorical awareness

**The assessment challenge**: How to reward substantive revision without devaluing surface correctness?

**VIRENS 101's approach**:
- **Surface revision expected** (conventions assessed in portfolio holistically)
- **Substantive revision rewarded explicitly** (reflective one-pagers must cite global changes)
- **Tracked changes required** for portfolio pieces (makes substantive revision visible)

### How Students Learn This Distinction

**Week 5 workshop**: "What Makes Revision Substantive?"
- Analyze two revision examples side-by-side
- Example A: Typo fixes, word substitutions
- Example B: Restructured argument, added evidence, reframed intro
- Students identify which revision demonstrates learning

**Reflective one-pager requirements**:
- Must cite "substantive changes" (not "I fixed grammar")
- Prompt: "What did you rethink, not just fix?"
- Examples provided of strong vs. weak revision documentation

**Portfolio rubric**:
- Outcome 2 (Composing Processes) explicitly requires "substantive revision"
- Graders trained to distinguish global from local changes
- Tracked changes must show evolution of thinking, not just cleanup

---

## Portfolio Integration

### How Revision Proves Learning

Revision appears in portfolio assessment in three ways:

#### 1. Process Evidence (Direct)

**What students include**:
- Drafts with tracked changes
- Peer feedback received
- Reflective one-pagers documenting decisions

**What this demonstrates**:
- Outcome 2: Multiple drafts and substantive revision
- Outcome 6: Reflection on revision choices
- Outcome 7: Documentation of process

**Why this matters**: Makes invisible labor (revision) visible as evidence

#### 2. Polished Pieces (Indirect)

**What students include**:
- Final versions of selected pieces
- Conventions and organization assessed holistically

**What this demonstrates**:
- Revision resulted in quality product
- Surface and substantive changes integrated
- Command of rhetorical choices

**Why this matters**: Proves revision process led to improved writing

#### 3. Cover Letter Argument (Meta-Level)

**What students include**:
- Synthesis of revision journey across semester
- Analysis of how revision developed their thinking
- Transfer claims about applying revision strategies elsewhere

**What this demonstrates**:
- Metacognitive awareness of revision as learning
- Ability to articulate revision principles
- Transfer potential

**Why this matters**: Understanding revision process enables future application

## Timeline Design

### Why This Pacing?

**Ongoing micro-revisions (weekly)**:
- **Purpose**: Build daily revision habit
- **Cognitive load**: Low (5-10 minutes per fragment)
- **Research base**: Distributed practice more effective than massed (Bjork)

**Structured cycles (every 2-3 weeks)**:
- **Purpose**: Deep engagement with substantive revision
- **Cognitive load**: Moderate-high (2-4 hours per cycle)
- **Research base**: Feedback timing matters (Anson 2002); 2-3 week cycle allows processing

**Portfolio revision (Weeks 12-15)**:
- **Purpose**: Curation and synthesis at scale
- **Cognitive load**: High (8-12 hours total)
- **Research base**: Revision of revision (meta-level) enables transfer (Nowacek 2011)

**Why six Eli cycles specifically?**
- One per Movement (Weeks 5, 7 = M1-M2; Weeks 9, 11 = M2-M3; Weeks 13, 14 = M4)
- Spaced across semester (not clustered)
- Enough repetition to build skill, not so many it's overwhelming
- 240 points total (meaningful weight in grade)

**Why reflective one-pagers at Weeks 6, 9, 12, 14?**
- After substantial revision cycles (time to accumulate insights)
- Before next Movement begins (synthesis before transition)
- Four across semester = distributed metacognitive practice
- 2.5% each = meaningful but not overwhelming

---

## Evaluation Criteria

### Why These Weights?

**Engagement with Feedback (40%)**

**Highest weight because**:
- Feedback responsiveness is core skill
- Research shows students who engage with feedback improve more (Eli Review studies)
- This is what distinguishes revision from editing
- Most directly observable (did student cite specific comments?)

**What this assesses**:
- Reading feedback carefully (comprehension)
- Discriminating useful from unhelpful suggestions (critical thinking)
- Explaining decisions about what to use/ignore (metacognition)

**Substantiveness of Changes (40%)**

**Equal weight to engagement because**:
- Students could cite feedback but make only surface changes
- Substantive revision is the goal, not just feedback acknowledgment
- Requires higher-order thinking (reorganization, reconceptualization)

**What this assesses**:
- Global vs. local revision (Sommers' distinction)
- Willingness to rethink, not just fix (intellectual risk-taking)
- Application of rhetorical principles (audience, purpose, genre)

**Metacognitive Awareness (20%)**

**Lower weight but essential because**:
- Articulating revision decisions develops transfer capacity
- Reflection without action has limited value (hence only 20%)
- But action without understanding also limits transfer
- This component bridges doing and understanding

**What this assesses**:
- Ability to explain *why* changes improve writing
- Connection of revision to rhetorical principles
- Awareness of own learning process

**Why these specific percentages?**
- 40/40/20 balances action (engagement, changes) with reflection (awareness)
- Both engagement and substantiveness necessary for full credit
- Metacognition enhances but doesn't replace revision action
- Students can earn B-range credit through solid engagement + changes, A-range requires metacognitive insight

## Comparison to Traditional Models

### Alternative Approaches Considered

**Option A: Draft-Grade-Revise Model (Rejected)**

**Structure**:
- Submit draft → Receive grade + comments → Optional revision for higher grade

**Rejected because**:
- Treats revision as remedial (raising D to C)
- Students satisfied with B often don't revise
- Grade on draft discourages risk-taking
- Doesn't value revision as generative process

**Option B: Revision Portfolio Only (Rejected)**

**Structure**:
- Multiple drafts required, only final version graded
- Revision process ungraded

**Rejected because**:
- Doesn't reward revision labor explicitly
- Students could ignore feedback, still produce good final draft
- Process invisible in assessment
- Misses opportunity to develop metacognitive awareness

**Option C: Separate Revision Grade (Rejected)**

**Structure**:
- Draft graded, revision graded separately, both count

**Rejected because**:
- Creates two high-stakes moments
- Complicated grade calculation
- Revision grade might not align with quality improvement
- Students confused about whether draft or revision matters more

**Option D: Contract-Based Revision (Rejected for this course)**

**Structure**:
- Contract: "Complete X revisions = B"
- Quality assessed only for A differentiation

**Rejected because**:
- Department requires traditional grading throughout semester
- Completion doesn't guarantee substantive revision
- Hard to define "complete" revision
- Better fit for labor-based grading contract (not feasible here)

**Option E: Formative + Portfolio Integration (SELECTED)**

**Structure**:
- 20% formative (peer review + reflections)
- Portfolio includes revision evidence
- Covers both process and product

**Selected because**:
1. Values revision labor explicitly (20% formative)
2. Requires substantive evidence (tracked changes, reflections)
3. Integrates into holistic outcomes assessment (portfolio)
4. Develops metacognition (reflective one-pagers)
5. Feasible within departmental grading requirements

## Equity Considerations

### Who Does This Assessment Serve?

**Potential advantages**:
- **Values process over product** (helps students who struggle with initial drafting)
- **Multiple opportunities** (six Eli cycles = many chances to demonstrate revision skill)
- **Metacognitive component** (rewards thinking, not just polished prose)
- **Formative feedback** (students get direction for improvement before high-stakes portfolio)

**Potential disadvantages**:
- **Time-intensive** (2-4 hours per Eli cycle × 6 cycles = 12-24 hours)
- **Technology dependent** (Eli Review requires reliable internet access)
- **Verbal fluency favored** (reflective one-pagers reward students who can articulate thinking)
- **Cultural differences in feedback** (some cultures view peer critique differently)

**Mitigations implemented**:
- **Distributed timeline** (revision spread across semester, not crammed)
- **Tech support** (campus labs, device checkout, Eli training in Week 2)
- **Scaffolded reflection** (sentence stems provided for one-pagers)
- **Flexible feedback modes** (written, audio comments, in-person conversations all valued)

**Ongoing question**: Does explicit revision credit advantage students with time/resources to revise extensively? Alternative: threshold model (meet revision minimum, portfolio quality determines grade)?

---

## Evidence & Iteration

### Evidence to Collect

To assess whether revision credit achieves goals:

- [ ] **Revision quality analysis**: Do students make substantive vs. surface changes? Track across semester.
- [ ] **Feedback engagement patterns**: Which students cite specific comments? Which ignore feedback?
- [ ] **Correlation study**: Does revision component score predict portfolio quality?
- [ ] **Metacognitive depth**: Do reflective one-pagers show growing sophistication?
- [ ] **Transfer evidence**: In exit surveys, do students report using revision strategies elsewhere?
- [ ] **Equity audit**: Do revision scores correlate with student demographics or resources?

### Revision Notes

**If students make only surface revisions despite prompts**:
- Add required annotation: highlight substantive changes before submitting
- Provide more examples of global vs. local revision
- Workshop: peer review of revision (students review each other's tracked changes)

**If reflective one-pagers are superficial**:
- Require specific quotations from feedback received
- Add sentence stems: "When [reviewer] suggested [X], I realized..."
- Grade exemplars with commentary on what makes reflection deep

**If revision component doesn't predict portfolio quality**:
- Investigate: Are students revising but not learning? Or learning but not documenting?
- Adjust balance: More weight on substantive changes, less on engagement?
- Consider threshold: Meet revision minimum, portfolio determines grade differentiation

**If time burden is inequitable**:
- Reduce Eli cycles from 6 to 4 (eliminate Weeks 7, 13)
- Make reflective one-pagers shorter (500 words vs. 750-1000)
- Provide more in-class revision time (reduce independent workload)
