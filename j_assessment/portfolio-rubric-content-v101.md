## Overview

Your portfolio is assessed holistically using rubrics aligned with all seven course learning outcomes. Rather than grading individual pieces separately, the entire portfolio is evaluated for evidence of outcome achievement.

**Assessment approach**: Criterion-referenced (did you meet outcomes?) not norm-referenced (how do you compare to peers?)

**Portfolio weight**: 50% of course grade

**See also**: [[portfolio-requirements-content-v101|What to include in portfolio]]

**Justification**: [[portfolio-rubric-reasons-v101#Holistic Assessment Philosophy|Why holistic grading?]]

## How Portfolios Are Graded

### Assessment Process

**Step 1: Completeness check**
- All required components present? (cover letter, 2-3 polished pieces, process evidence, process archaeology)
- Organized according to specifications?
- Meets minimum length requirements?

**Incomplete portfolios**: Cannot earn above 60% (D-level) regardless of quality

**Step 2: Holistic reading**
- Read cover letter first (student's argument for their grade)
- Read polished pieces with attention to outcome evidence
- Review process evidence for substantive revision
- Consider process archaeology for metacognitive growth

**Step 3: Outcome-by-outcome assessment**
- For each of 7 outcomes, rate portfolio evidence as: Exceptional / Proficient / Developing / Limited
- Look across entire portfolio (not single piece) for outcome evidence
- Consider both products (polished pieces) and processes (revision, reflection)

**Step 4: Overall grade determination**
- Translate outcome ratings into percentage
- Consider holistic impression (portfolio coherence, professional presentation)
- Apply grade distribution philosophy (see below)

## Outcome-Based Assessment

### How Each Outcome Is Assessed

For each outcome, portfolios are evaluated holistically for evidence across all components:

| Outcome | Portfolio Evidence Assessed |
|---------|---------------------------|
| **1. Rhetorical Awareness** | Polished pieces demonstrate audience awareness; cover letter articulates rhetorical choices |
| **2. Critical Reading** | Citations in polished pieces; analysis of course readings; engagement with difficulty in dev logs |
| **3. Composing Processes** | Process evidence shows multiple drafts; dev logs document workflow; system map shows evolution |
| **4. Research & Source Use** | BEAM portfolio work cited; sources integrated rhetorically; Zotero use documented |
| **5. Constraint Awareness** | Spec documents analyze constraints; cover letter discusses genre expectations; convention awareness |
| **6. Collaboration** | Peer feedback received and used; reflective one-pagers cite specific comments; revision responds to feedback |
| **7. Metacognition** | Cover letter argues with evidence; process archaeology shows growth; failure-as-diagnostic evident |

**See detailed rubrics below for each outcome.**

---

## Outcome 1: Rhetorical Awareness

**Outcome statement**: Compose texts that demonstrate awareness of audience, purpose, genre, and context.

### Rubric

**Exceptional (90-100%)**:
- Polished pieces show sophisticated audience adaptation across different rhetorical situations
- Cover letter explicitly analyzes rhetorical choices made ("I structured the opening to engage readers unfamiliar with...")
- Evidence of strategic genre awareness (choosing spec doc vs. essay for specific purpose)
- Demonstrates understanding that conventions are rhetorical tools, not arbitrary rules

**Proficient (80-89%)**:
- Polished pieces demonstrate clear audience awareness
- Cover letter identifies rhetorical situation for each piece
- Evidence of appropriate genre choices
- Conventions handled appropriately for context

**Developing (70-79%)**:
- Polished pieces show emerging audience awareness but inconsistent application
- Cover letter mentions audience/purpose but doesn't analyze choices
- Some genre awareness but may default to academic essay
- Conventions mostly appropriate with occasional lapses

**Limited (Below 70%)**:
- Polished pieces lack clear audience awareness
- Cover letter doesn't address rhetorical situation
- Little evidence of genre awareness beyond academic essay
- Convention issues interfere with communication

---

## Common Questions

### Do all polished pieces need to demonstrate all outcomes?

**No.** Outcomes are assessed **across the entire portfolio**, not piece by piece.

Example: One polished piece might strongly demonstrate Outcomes 1, 2, 5 while another demonstrates 3, 6, 7. Together they cover all outcomes.

### What if I excel at some outcomes but struggle with others?

**Your overall grade reflects the whole portfolio.** Strong achievement in some outcomes can offset developing work in others, but all outcomes should show at least Developing-level evidence.

### How much does the cover letter matter?

**Significantly.** The cover letter is your opportunity to **argue for your grade** by directing attention to portfolio evidence. A weak cover letter makes it harder to see your achievement.

### Can I revise my portfolio after submission?

**No.** Portfolio submissions are final. However, you can schedule a **portfolio preview conference** in Week 12 to get feedback before finalizing.

### What if my portfolio is incomplete?

Incomplete portfolios (missing required components) cannot earn above 60% regardless of quality. Ensure all components are present.

## Using This Rubric

### During Portfolio Assembly (Weeks 13-15)

Use this rubric to:
- **Self-assess**: Which outcomes do I have strong evidence for? Which need more work?
- **Select pieces**: Choose polished pieces that collectively demonstrate all outcomes
- **Draft cover letter**: Make sure to address each outcome with portfolio evidence
- **Check gaps**: If you can't find evidence for an outcome, revise a piece to demonstrate it

### In Your Cover Letter

Reference this rubric explicitly:
- "For Outcome 3 (Composing Processes), my portfolio demonstrates Proficient-level achievement through..."
- "The evidence for this rating includes [specific drafts, dev log entries, system map annotations]..."

This shows you understand the assessment criteria and can argue strategically.

---

## Resources

### Example Portfolios

Strong portfolio examples (from previous semesters) available in Canvas show how different students demonstrated outcomes in different ways.

### Portfolio Preview Conference

Week 12 optional conference lets you:
- Get feedback on which outcomes you're demonstrating well
- Identify gaps in outcome coverage
- Discuss revision priorities

**Highly recommended** if you want feedback before final submission.
