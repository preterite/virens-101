## Overview

The formative half of your grade (50%) assesses your **sustained engagement with writing processes** throughout the semester. Unlike the portfolio (which is summative), formative work is graded primarily on **completion and engagement**, not perfection.

**Total formative work**: 50% of course grade

**Components**:
- Fragment Accumulation: 15%
- Revision & Feedback: 20%
- Process Documentation: 10%
- Attendance & Participation: 5%

**Philosophy**: These components reward consistent work, thoughtful engagement, and metacognitive reflection—the daily labor that builds toward your portfolio.

**See also**: [[grading-assessment-content-v101|Overall grading policy]]

## Fragment Accumulation (15%)

### What Counts as a Fragment

**Definition**: A text fragment is **one claim with supporting evidence** in 150-400 words.

**Minimum requirements**:
- 150-400 words (shorter = not counted, longer = fine but unnecessary)
- Makes a claim (assertion, argument, interpretation)
- Provides evidence (quotation, example, data, reasoning)
- Cites source if using one (course reading or outside source)
- Saved in OneDrive with proper naming: `YYYY-MM-DD-topic-slug-status.docx`

**What fragments are NOT**:
- ❌ Summaries without claims
- ❌ Quotations without analysis
- ❌ Freewriting without focus
- ❌ Journal entries about feelings (unless analyzed rhetorically)

**What fragments CAN be**:
- ✅ Response to course reading with specific claim
- ✅ Analysis of constraint sequence in published text
- ✅ Argument about writing process, supported by dev log evidence
- ✅ Synthesis connecting multiple readings
- ✅ Spec document excerpt analyzing requirements

**Justification**: [[formative-grading-reasons-v101#Fragment Definition|Why these requirements?]]

---

### Grading Structure (15% total)

Your fragment accumulation grade has two components:

**Completion baseline (12%)**:
- Credit for producing fragments on schedule
- Target: 3-4 fragments per week = 40-50 total across semester
- Each week's fragments due Sunday 11:59pm
- Late submissions subject to graduated penalties (see below)

**Quality baseline (3%)**:
- Instructor spot-checks ~10 fragments across semester
- Quality criteria: Genuine engagement with readings, substantive claims, meaningful development
- Not assessed for polish, correctness, or brilliance—just genuine effort

---

### Weekly Targets

| Week | Target Fragments | Cumulative Total |
|------|-----------------|------------------|
| Weeks 1-2 | 2-3 per week | 4-6 |
| Weeks 3-7 | 3-4 per week | 20-26 |
| Weeks 8-11 | 3-4 per week | 36-44 |
| Weeks 12-15 | 2-3 per week | 44-56 |

**Flexibility**: You can produce more some weeks, fewer others. What matters is **cumulative total** and **consistent engagement**.

**Minimum to earn full completion credit**: 40 fragments meeting basic requirements

**Recommended strategy**: Aim for 45-50 to build robust portfolio corpus

---

### How Fragments Are Graded

**Each week**:
- Instructor checks OneDrive folder
- Counts fragments submitted that week
- Spot-checks 1-2 for quality baseline

**Credit calculation**:
- **3-4 fragments submitted on time**: Full weekly credit
- **2 fragments submitted**: Partial credit (66%)
- **1 fragment submitted**: Minimal credit (33%)
- **0 fragments submitted**: No credit

**Late penalties**:
- 1-3 days late: 20% penalty
- 4-7 days late: 30% penalty
- 8+ days late: 50% penalty

**Cumulative calculation at semester's end**:
- Total fragments produced ÷ 50 target × 12% = Completion score
- Quality spot-checks averaged × 3% = Quality score
- **Total fragment grade = Completion score + Quality score (max 15%)**

**Example**:
- Student produces 45 fragments on time (45 ÷ 50 × 12% = 10.8%)
- Plus 3 late (penalty reduced credit)
- Completion score: 11.5%
- Quality spot-checks average 90%
- Quality score: 90% × 3% = 2.7%
- **Total: 14.2% of 15% possible**

---

### Common Questions

**What if I miss a week?**
- Catch up the following week (4-6 fragments instead of 3-4)
- Late penalties apply unless documented emergency

**Can I submit 10 fragments one week and 0 the next?**
- Technically yes (cumulative total matters)
- **Not recommended**: Defeats purpose of building consistent writing habit

**What if I write a 600-word fragment?**
- Counts as one fragment (not two)
- Consider: Could this be split into two related fragments?

**Do revised fragments count twice?**
- No—counts once when first submitted
- Revisions are valued in **Revision & Feedback** component (separate 20%)

---

## Revision & Feedback (20%)

This component has two parts: giving peer feedback through Eli Review (10%) and documenting your responsive revision through reflective one-pagers (10%).

### Peer Review Quality (10%)

**What counts**: Giving helpful feedback to peers through Eli Review across 6 graded cycles.

**Grading structure**:
- 6 graded peer review cycles (Weeks 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 14)
- Each cycle: Review 3 peers' work using Describe-Evaluate-Suggest model
- Each cycle worth ~40 points (6 × 40 = 240 total points)

**How peer review is assessed**:
- **Completion**: Did you review all assigned peers by deadline?
- **Quality**: How helpful were your comments? (rated by peers receiving feedback)
- **Specificity**: Did you provide specific observations, not generic praise?
- **Constructiveness**: Did you offer actionable suggestions?

**Helpfulness ratings**:
- Peers rate your feedback 1-5 stars
- Your average helpfulness rating affects your score
- Target: >3.5 average across semester

**Point distribution per cycle**:
- 20 points: Completion (reviewed all 3 peers)
- 20 points: Quality (helpfulness ratings + instructor spot-check)

**Cannot be made up**: Peer review deadlines are firm (collaborative work depends on timeliness)

**See**: [[eli-review-intro-content-v101|Eli Review guide]]

---

### Reflective One-Pagers (10%)

**What counts**: Four 300-500 word reflections documenting how you used peer feedback to revise.

**Due dates**: After peer review cycles in Weeks 5, 8, 11, 14

**Required content**:
1. **What feedback did you receive?** (cite specific peer comments)
2. **Which feedback will you use?** (and why? which will you ignore? and why?)
3. **What revisions did you make?** (with before/after examples)

**Grading criteria**:
- ✅ Cites specific peer feedback (names peers, quotes comments)
- ✅ Shows decision-making about feedback (not just accepting all suggestions)
- ✅ Provides revision evidence (before/after, specific changes)
- ✅ Demonstrates metacognitive awareness (understands own revision process)

**Each one-pager worth**: 2.5% (4 × 2.5% = 10%)

**What's NOT required**:
- ❌ Perfect writing (not polished essays)
- ❌ Long length (300-500 words is sufficient)
- ❌ Implementing ALL peer suggestions (strategic selection is valued)

**See**: [[reflective-one-pagers-content-v101|Detailed guidelines]]

**Justification**: [[formative-grading-reasons-v101#Reflective One-Pagers Purpose|Why these matter]]

---

## Process Documentation (10%)

This component rewards maintaining visible evidence of your writing process through dev logs (5%) and system maps (5%).

### Dev Logs (5%)

**What counts**: Weekly 150-250 word entries documenting what you did, what happened, what you learned.

**Required structure (three parts)**:
1. **What I did**: Concrete actions this week (wrote 3 fragments, attended peer review, revised spec document...)
2. **What happened**: Outcomes, surprises, difficulties (peer feedback confused me, revision took longer than expected...)
3. **What I learned**: Insights about your process (I write better in morning, starting with outline doesn't work for me...)

**Grading approach**: **Completion-based** (not quality)
- Did you write entries consistently? (target: 12-15 across semester)
- Did you use three-part structure?
- Do entries show genuine reflection (not just perfunctory "I did my homework")?

**Calculation**:
- 12+ substantial entries = 5%
- 9-11 entries = 4%
- 6-8 entries = 3%
- 3-5 entries = 2%
- <3 entries = 1%

**What makes an entry "substantial"**:
- Meets length requirement (150-250 words)
- Uses three-part structure
- Shows actual reflection (names specific challenges or insights)

**What's NOT required**:
- ❌ Polished writing
- ❌ Positive tone (struggle and frustration are valuable data)
- ❌ Every single week (12-15 across 15 weeks allows flexibility)

---

### System Maps (5%)

**What counts**: Visual diagram of your writing workflow showing how you move from reading → notes → fragments → polished work.

**Minimum requirements**:
- **Draft version** (Week 3): Basic workflow diagram
- **Revised version** (submitted with portfolio): Shows evolution of your process

**Grading criteria**:
- ✅ Shows actual workflow (not idealized process you wish you had)
- ✅ Includes all major tools (index cards, OneDrive, Zotero, Eli Review)
- ✅ Indicates connections/flows between stages
- ✅ Revised version includes annotations showing development ("Early in semester I..., but by M3 I...")

**Format options**:
- Hand-drawn and photographed (totally acceptable)
- Digital (PowerPoint, Google Drawings, Canva, etc.)
- Any visual format that clearly shows relationships

**What's NOT required**:
- ❌ Artistic quality (boxes and arrows are fine)
- ❌ Professional design software
- ❌ Complexity (simple and clear better than elaborate and confusing)

**Grading**:
- Draft version (Week 3): 2%
- Revised version (with portfolio): 3%

**Justification**: [[formative-grading-reasons-v101#System Maps Purpose|Why visual documentation?]]

---

## Attendance & Participation (5%)

**What counts**: Daily engagement with course activities, verified through reading quizzes.

### Daily Quizzes (50 total, 1 point each)

**Format**: Brief Canvas quiz checking reading completion
- 2-3 questions per quiz
- Taken at start of class
- 5 minutes to complete

**Purpose**: Not comprehension testing—just verification you did the reading

**Sample questions**:
- "Which author argues that difficulty is a productive site of learning?"
- "According to Ong [[@ong2012writi]], what is the primary difference between oral and literate cultures?"
- "What is one constraint Wolfram identifies in emoji communication?"

**Grading**:
- Correct answer: 1 point
- Incorrect answer: 0 points
- Lowest 10 scores dropped (equivalent to 1.5 weeks of absences)

**Why quizzes instead of attendance**:
- Verifies reading engagement, not just physical presence
- Built-in forgiveness for absences (10 dropped = free passes)
- No make-ups needed (forgiveness built in)

**Calculation**:
- 50 quizzes offered
- Keep 40 highest scores
- 40 points ÷ 40 possible × 5% = Participation score

**Maximum score**: 5% (earning 40/40 after drops)

**Strategic use of drops**:
- Save for actual absences
- Or use if you didn't do reading a few times
- First 10 low scores don't hurt you

**What's NOT graded**:
- ❌ Verbal participation (benefits extroverts unfairly)
- ❌ In-class writing quality (that's in portfolio)
- ❌ Physical presence alone (must also engage with reading)

---

## Late Work Policies

### Graduated Penalties

Late formative work receives reduced credit to maintain peer review cycles and collaborative learning:

**Fragments**:
- 1-3 days late: 20% penalty
- 4-7 days late: 30% penalty
- 8+ days late: 50% penalty

**Reflective one-pagers**:
- Same graduated penalties
- Cannot be more than 2 weeks late (after that, cycle has moved on)

**What cannot be made up**:
- **Peer review**: Deadlines are firm (collaborative work)
- **Quizzes**: No make-ups (lowest 10 dropped = built-in forgiveness)

### Documented Emergencies

Official accommodations through DSU or verified emergencies:
- Extended deadlines arranged with instructor
- No penalties for accommodated extensions
- Must be arranged BEFORE deadline when possible

---

## Calculating Your Formative Grade

### Example Student Calculations

**Good Student** (completes everything competently):
- Fragments: 45 submitted, 10 average quality → 14%
- Peer review: All cycles complete, 4.0 helpfulness → 10%
- Reflective one-pagers: All 4 complete, cite feedback → 10%
- Dev logs: 14 substantial entries → 5%
- System maps: Both versions complete → 5%
- Quizzes: 42/40 after drops → 5%
- **Total formative: 49%**

**Check-Box Student** (minimal engagement):
- Fragments: 40 submitted, 5 late, minimal quality → 10%
- Peer review: All cycles but unhelpful (2.5 helpfulness) → 7%
- Reflective one-pagers: All 4 but generic → 6%
- Dev logs: 8 entries, some perfunctory → 3%
- System maps: Basic only → 3%
- Quizzes: 35/40 after drops → 4.5%
- **Total formative: 33.5%**

**Struggling Student** (inconsistent):
- Fragments: 30 submitted, 10 late → 7%
- Peer review: Missed 2 cycles → 6.5%
- Reflective one-pagers: Only 2 submitted → 5%
- Dev logs: 5 entries → 2%
- System maps: Draft only → 2%
- Quizzes: 30/40 after drops → 3.75%
- **Total formative: 26.25%**

## Self-Monitoring Your Progress

### Checking Your Grade

**Weekly**:
- Fragment count in OneDrive folder
- Eli helpfulness ratings in analytics dashboard
- Quiz scores in Canvas gradebook

**Midterm** (Week 8):
- Formative grade calculated to date
- Projected final grade if pattern continues
- Opportunity to course-correct

### Warning Signs

**You're falling behind if**:
- Fragment count below 50% of target for week number
- Eli helpfulness rating below 3.0
- Missing multiple peer review cycles
- Dev logs sporadic or absent
- Quiz average below 70% after drops

**What to do**: Schedule office hours immediately to develop recovery plan

---

## Common Questions

### Can I make up missing fragments at the end?

**Technically yes** (cumulative total matters), but:
- Late penalties will reduce credit
- Defeats purpose of building consistent habit
- Leaves no corpus to draw from earlier for portfolio

### What if I have a really good reason for missing peer review?

**Only acceptable reasons**: Documented emergencies, official accommodations

**Not acceptable**: Forgot, was busy, didn't like the assignment

### Do I have to use all peer feedback I receive?

**No.** Strategic, selective use of feedback is valued. Your reflective one-pagers should explain:
- Which feedback you're using and why
- Which feedback you're ignoring and why
- How you're making revision decisions

### What if my system map changes drastically mid-semester?

**Perfect.** The revised version (for portfolio) should show that evolution with annotations.

---

## Resources & Support

### Weekly Check-Ins

**Self-assessment prompts** available in Canvas:
- "Am I on track with fragments?"
- "Is my dev log showing genuine reflection?"
- "What patterns do I see in my Eli ratings?"

### Office Hours

**When to come**:
- Week 4: If fragment habit isn't established
- Week 6: If Eli ratings below 3.0
- Week 9: If midterm grade showed concerns
- Week 12: If behind on cumulative totals

### Writing Center

**Available for**:
- Developing fragment topics
- Understanding peer feedback
- Revision strategies

**NOT available for**:
- Doing your work for you
- Gaming the assessment system
