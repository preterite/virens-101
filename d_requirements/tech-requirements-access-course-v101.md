## What You Need to Have or Be Able to Access

This course uses a small set of digital tools alongside physical materials (index cards). Total estimated cost: **$30-35 for the semester**, which includes all required materials.

You will need:
1. **Regular access to a computer** (laptop or desktop) with internet connection
2. **A web browser** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge—all free)
3. **Index cards** (3×5 or 4×6, ruled or unruled)—about $10-15 at campus bookstore or office supply stores
4. **Eli Review subscription** (web-based peer review platform)—$20 for semester access

Most other software you'll use is either already on your computer (Microsoft Word) or free to access (OneDrive, Zotero, Canvas).

## Detailed Requirements by Tool

### 1. Index Cards (Required Purchase: ~$10-15)

**What**: Physical 3×5 or 4×6 index cards, ruled or unruled based on your preference

**Where to buy**: WSU Bookie, Target, Walmart, office supply stores, or online

**How many**: 200-300 cards should be sufficient for the semester; you can buy more if needed

**Why analog**: Index cards provide a tactile way to capture ideas, sort concepts, and organize thinking before moving to digital formats. They're portable, don't require batteries, and let you think without screen distraction.

**Cost-saving options**: 
- Generic store brands work as well as name brands
- Smaller packs are fine to start; you can buy more mid-semester if needed
- Used cards from other students (though you probably want fresh ones for this purpose)

### 2. Microsoft Word + OneDrive (Free via WSU)

**What**: Word processing software for drafting fragments and storing your corpus

**How to access**: All WSU students get free Microsoft Office 365 licenses, which includes:
- Word (for writing and revising)
- OneDrive (cloud storage for your folder structure)

**How to set up**: Visit [WSU Office 365 portal](https://office365.wsu.edu) and sign in with your WSU credentials. Follow prompts to download and install Office apps on your computer.

**What if I use a Mac**: Office 365 works on both Windows and Mac operating systems. OneDrive syncs across devices.

**What if I prefer Google Docs**: You're welcome to use Google Docs for drafting, but you'll need to maintain a clear folder structure (similar to OneDrive) and you'll still need Word access for certain features like Zotero integration.

### 3. Zotero (Free Citation Manager)

**What**: Free, open-source software for managing citations and building your bibliography

**How to access**: Download from [zotero.org](https://zotero.org)

**Platforms**: Works on Windows, Mac, and Linux

**Why**: Zotero helps you:
- Store and organize sources you're reading
- Tag sources using the BEAM framework
- Generate properly formatted citations
- Insert citations directly into Word documents

**Setup time**: We'll spend 50 minutes in Week 4 or 5 (during a library instruction session) learning to use Zotero. You don't need to know it beforehand.

### 4. Eli Review (Required Purchase: $20)

**What**: Web-based platform for structured peer feedback with analytics

**How to access**: You'll receive a course invitation link in Week 2. Purchase access directly through Eli Review's website (they accept credit/debit cards and PayPal).

**Cost**: $20 for semester-long access to this course

**Why**: Eli Review provides:
- Structured feedback protocols (Describe-Evaluate-Suggest)
- Anonymous peer review if desired
- Helpfulness analytics so you can see how your feedback is received
- Scheduling and reminders for review cycles

**Timing**: We'll introduce Eli Review in Week 2 for a no-stakes practice round. First graded peer review cycle starts Week 5 (after you've had time to get comfortable).

**What if $20 is a hardship**: Please talk to me privately. We may be able to find alternative funding sources or make other arrangements. Don't let cost prevent you from participating.

### 5. Canvas (Free LMS)

**What**: WSU's learning management system where you'll submit work, access assignments, and check grades

**How to access**: [canvas.wsu.edu](https://canvas.wsu.edu) using your WSU credentials

**What you'll do there**:
- Submit final drafts of major assignments
- Access course readings and handouts
- Participate in occasional discussion forums
- Check your grades and feedback

Canvas is the institutional "wrapper" for the course—the official place where work gets submitted and recorded.

## Technology Access and Equity

### If You Don't Own a Computer

You can still succeed in this course using campus resources:

**Computer labs**: WSU has computer labs in the library and other academic buildings with Microsoft Office, internet access, and printing capabilities. Labs have varying hours; check [WSU IT website](https://it.wsu.edu) for current schedules and locations.

**Laptop checkout**: Some departments and the library offer short-term laptop loans. Check with the library circulation desk.

**Smartphone limitations**: While you can access Canvas and Eli Review on a smartphone, you'll have difficulty drafting fragments and organizing your corpus effectively. Plan to use campus computers regularly if you don't own a laptop.

### If You Have Unreliable Internet at Home

**On-campus WiFi**: WSU provides free WiFi across campus. Identify locations (library, student union, academic buildings) where you can work between or after classes.

**Off-campus internet**: Some Pullman coffee shops and public spaces offer WiFi. The public library also provides internet access.

**Offline work strategies**: 
- Index cards don't require internet—use them for capture and initial thinking
- Word documents can be created offline and synced to OneDrive when you reconnect
- Plan ahead for Eli Review cycles, which require internet to submit and give feedback

### If You Need Disability Accommodations

Technology requirements can create barriers for students with disabilities. If you need accommodations related to:
- Screen readers or other assistive technologies
- Alternative formats for reading materials
- Different input methods (voice-to-text, alternative keyboards)
- Extended time for digital submissions

Please contact Access Center (Disability Services) as soon as possible and let me know what accommodations are approved. See [[accommodations-policy-course-v101]] for details.

## What We Won't Require

To keep costs low and barriers minimal, we will **not** require:

- Expensive textbooks (course readings provided digitally via Canvas or library reserves)
- Specialized software beyond what's listed above
- Tablet or iPad (though they can supplement computer access)
- Printer (you can draft and revise digitally; only portfolio might need printing)
- Specific brand or model of computer (any computer that runs a web browser and Word will work)

## Technology Philosophy

This course treats technology as **infrastructure for intellectual work**, not as the focus of instruction. You're not learning tools for tools' sake—you're learning to organize, document, and reflect on writing processes, and these tools make that work manageable.

The tech stack is designed to be:
- **Minimal**: Only five components (cards, Word/OneDrive, Zotero, Eli Review, Canvas)
- **Mostly free**: Only index cards ($10-15) and Eli Review ($20) cost money
- **Cross-platform**: Works on Windows and Mac
- **Focused**: Each tool does one thing well; they don't duplicate functions
- **Non-proprietary**: You can export your work and use it elsewhere after the course ends

For more details on how these tools connect and when you'll learn them, see the Tech Stack Integration Map (distributed Week 2) and [[technology-use-course-v101]] policy.

## When Tech Goes Wrong

Technology fails. When it does:

**Contact me immediately**: If you can't access a required tool or resource, let me know as soon as possible. Don't wait until the deadline.

**Document the problem**: Take a screenshot or write down the error message. This helps troubleshoot.

**Have a backup plan**: Save work frequently, keep files in multiple locations, start assignments early enough that a technology failure doesn't become a crisis.

**Use campus IT support**: WSU IT Help Desk can assist with Office 365, OneDrive, Canvas access, and general computer problems. Visit [it.wsu.edu](https://it.wsu.edu) or call 509-335-4357.

**Check the course Canvas page**: If systems are down, I'll post announcements about extensions or alternative submission methods.
