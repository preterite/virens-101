## Design Rationale

The technology requirements for VIRENS 101 reflect three competing commitments: (1) providing students with real tools for intellectual work, not toy versions, (2) maintaining low financial barriers to course participation, and (3) acknowledging that technology access correlates with socioeconomic privilege and must be addressed through course design rather than assumed.

The resulting tech stack—index cards, Word/OneDrive, Zotero, Eli Review, and Canvas—represents a strategic middle ground between "no technology" (which would fail to prepare students for writing in digital contexts) and "assume full access" (which would exclude students without personal computers or reliable internet). At approximately $30-35 total cost, the requirement is lower than most college textbooks while providing more lasting value.

This approach treats technology as infrastructure rather than pedagogy: tools enable corpus management, citation organization, and structured feedback, but they don't determine what students learn. The course could theoretically be taught with different tools, but these particular choices optimize for cost, adoptability, and pedagogical coherence.

## Theoretical Grounding

### Composition Pedagogy and Technology

**Haas on Technology and Literacy:**
Christina Haas's *Writing Technology* argues that writing technologies are not neutral instruments but shape how we think about writing and what counts as writing. Her research demonstrates that writers using different technologies develop different cognitive strategies and representations of their texts.

VIRENS 101's tech stack acknowledges this by maintaining a hybrid analog/digital approach. Index cards provide tactile engagement with ideas before digital capture; OneDrive folder structures make corpus organization visible; Zotero externalizes citation memory. Each tool shapes student interaction with text differently, and making these differences explicit helps students develop technological literacy—understanding how tools shape intellectual work.

The course explicitly teaches this principle through "What You're Automating" discussions (Week 8), where students analyze what changes when they move from index card capture to digital file management. This metacognitive attention to tool effects distinguishes technological literacy from mere tool use.

**Selber's [[@selber2004multi]] Three Literacies:**
Stuart Selber's *Multiliteracies for a Digital Age* proposes three levels of computer literacy: functional (using tools effectively), critical (understanding technological contexts and consequences), and rhetorical (deploying technology strategically for situated purposes). Most writing courses address only functional literacy.

VIRENS 101's approach integrates all three:
- **Functional**: Students learn to use Word, Zotero, Eli Review effectively for their purposes
- **Critical**: Discussions of constraint sequencing, automation, and tool limitations develop critical perspective on technology
- **Rhetorical**: Students choose when to use which tool based on task demands, developing strategic judgment

This integrated approach treats technology as both practical skill and object of inquiry, not just invisible infrastructure.

**Kline [[@kline1985what]] on Mundane Technology:**
Ronald Kline's work on "mundane technology" argues that researchers often overlook everyday technologies (filing systems, note cards, reference management) in favor of dramatic innovations. Yet mundane technologies profoundly shape knowledge work.

The inclusion of index cards alongside digital tools reflects this insight. Physical cards represent mature, stable technology that students can use immediately without training. The tactile experience of sorting, discarding, and reorganizing cards builds habits transferable to digital contexts. This hybrid approach honors that effective knowledge work often combines multiple technological generations rather than replacing old with new.

## Implementation Approach

### Cost Structure and Equity

**$30-35 Total Cost Breakdown:**
- Index cards: $10-15
- Eli Review: $20
- Everything else: Free via institutional licenses or open-source software

**Comparison to Typical Course Costs:**
Average college textbook: $100-150. By providing all readings digitally and using free/open-source tools where possible, VIRENS 101 reduces student costs by 70-80% compared to courses requiring traditional textbooks.

**Why Not Completely Free?**
Index cards and Eli Review represent careful cost-benefit analyses:

**Index cards**: Analog tools provide crucial counterpoint to digital environments. Alternative options (notebook paper, loose sheets) lack the modularity and manipulability that make cards pedagogically valuable. At $10-15, cards are the most cost-effective way to provide tactile knowledge work infrastructure.

**Eli Review**: Structured peer feedback with analytics delivers pedagogical value difficult to replicate with free tools. Canvas's built-in peer review lacks:
- Describe-Evaluate-Suggest protocol structures
- Helpfulness analytics showing students how their feedback is received
- Sophisticated scheduling and anonymous review options
- Instructor dashboard showing completion patterns

At $20/semester, Eli Review costs less than most readers or textbook chapters while providing semester-long value. However, this remains the most negotiable cost if financial aid or alternative funding becomes available.

### Access Strategies

**Campus Computer Access:**
The course design acknowledges that not all students own personal computers. All required work can be completed using campus computer labs, though this requires more advance planning and time management from students.

**Strategic timing**: Eli Review cycles and major deadlines are scheduled to allow adequate campus lab time, avoiding last-minute rushes that disproportionately affect students without home computers.

**Offline Capability:**
The hybrid analog/digital approach provides genuine offline capability. Students without reliable internet can:
- Use index cards for capture and initial sorting
- Draft fragments in Word offline and sync when they access internet
- Complete most in-class writing activities regardless of connection

This design feature particularly benefits students with inconsistent internet access (rural areas, financial constraints, temporary disruptions).

**Alternatives for Students in Crisis:**
The course maintains flexibility for students facing temporary technology access problems: paper submissions accepted, extended deadlines for tech failures, alternative assignment formats when necessary. These accommodations recognize that technology access can be precarious even for students who own devices.

## Competing Values & Tradeoffs

### Real Tools vs. Simple Tools

**Tension:**
Zotero and Eli Review have learning curves that consume instructional time. Simpler tools (manual bibliographies, informal peer review) would be easier to teach but provide less transferable value.

**Resolution:**
The course invests 6 blocks (150 minutes) in tool instruction across the semester, treating this as infrastructure investment rather than pedagogical overhead. Tool literacy enables sustained work throughout the semester; the upfront cost pays ongoing dividends.

Additionally, "familiarize before stakes" principle (Eli Review introduced Week 2, graded cycles start Week 5) reduces anxiety around new tools.

### Cost vs. Capability

**Tension:**
More expensive tools could provide additional capability (collaborative writing platforms, specialized corpus analysis software), but higher costs exclude students.

**Resolution:**
The $30-35 threshold represents strategic constraint. Additional tools would provide marginal benefits—nice-to-have features rather than essential capabilities. The chosen stack delivers 80% of ideal functionality at 20% of potential cost, a favorable tradeoff.

Future versions might explore grant funding for Eli Review licenses to achieve zero-cost participation, but this requires institutional support beyond individual instructor capacity.

### Platform Specificity vs. Transferability

**Tension:**
Teaching proprietary tools (Microsoft Office, Eli Review) risks teaching students systems they may not have access to after the course. Open-source alternatives (LibreOffice, basic peer review protocols) transfer more broadly but may lack institutional support.

**Resolution:**
Mixed approach: Zotero is open-source and cross-platform; Word/OneDrive leverage existing institutional licenses students already have access to; Eli Review provides structured experience students can adapt to other peer review contexts even if they lose Eli access.

The emphasis on process documentation and system awareness (learning how tools work, not just how to use them) increases transferability regardless of specific platform.

### Accessibility Across Abilities

**Tension:**
Standard digital tools may create barriers for students with disabilities requiring assistive technologies or alternative formats.

**Resolution:**
Course design incorporates flexibility around how technology is used: voice-to-text for writing, screen readers for reading, alternative file formats when needed. Close coordination with Access Center ensures approved accommodations can be implemented.

Additionally, maintaining both analog (index cards) and digital options provides multiple pathways to achieve learning outcomes, reducing single-point-of-failure problems for students with specific access needs.

## Evidence & Iteration

### Evidence to Collect

- [ ] Student technology access survey (Week 1 and Week 8)
- [ ] Cost burden assessment: How many students report financial hardship from $30-35 requirement?
- [ ] Technology failure patterns: Which tools cause most problems? At what points in semester?
- [ ] Campus computer lab usage: How many students rely entirely on campus access?
- [ ] Tool effectiveness: Do students find Zotero and Eli Review worth the learning curve?
- [ ] Accessibility accommodations: What technology-related accommodations are most frequently requested?

### Revision Notes

**Future considerations:**
- Can departmental or institutional funding reduce or eliminate Eli Review cost?
- Are there open-source alternatives to Eli Review that provide comparable structure and analytics?
- Should course offer more explicit instruction in using campus computer resources?
- Does hybrid analog/digital approach successfully support students with limited internet access?
- How well does tool instruction timing (constraint sequencing) work?

**Potential adjustments:**
- If significant number of students report financial hardship, seek grant funding for Eli Review
- If campus computer access proves inadequate, advocate for extended lab hours or laptop loan programs
- If technology failures cluster around particular tools or times, adjust sequencing or provide better troubleshooting support
