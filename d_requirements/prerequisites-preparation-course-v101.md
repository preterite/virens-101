## What You Need to Start This Course

English 101 has no formal prerequisites. You don't need previous college coursework, a placement test score, or specific high school preparation to succeed here. This course is designed for first-year students entering college from varied educational backgrounds.

However, you will be asked to write frequently, read actively, and think about your own learning process—skills you can develop during the semester even if they feel unfamiliar at first.

---

## What "No Prerequisites" Really Means

**You don't need to be "good at writing" already.** This course teaches writing as a process of learning and discovery, not as a skill you either have or don't have. Every student—regardless of their confidence level—will develop new capabilities here.

**You don't need to love reading or writing.** Many successful students in this course start out uncertain about their relationship to academic work. That's normal and expected. The course design helps you build productive habits even if reading and writing feel difficult right now.

**You don't need extensive academic vocabulary.** We'll introduce concepts and terminology as you need them. You won't be penalized for not knowing terms like "rhetorical situation" or "metacognition" on day one—but you'll learn them by doing the work.

---

## What Varied Preparation Means in Practice

Students in this course typically arrive with:

- **Different amounts of writing experience**: Some have written extensively in high school; others have written primarily for tests or personal contexts
- **Different reading backgrounds**: Some read frequently for pleasure; others read primarily what's assigned
- **Different exposure to academic genres**: Some have written research papers and literary analyses; others have focused on personal narratives or practical writing
- **Different technology comfort**: Some manage digital files confidently; others are learning organizational systems for the first time
- **Different relationships to school**: Some feel comfortable asking questions and taking risks; others are still learning what college expects

All of these starting points are welcome here. The course is designed to meet you where you are and help you develop from that point.

## What the Course Assumes You Can Do

While there are no formal prerequisites, the course does assume you can:

1. **Read texts in English** at a college level, even if reading takes time and effort
2. **Write coherent sentences** that communicate ideas, even if the sentences aren't always polished
3. **Participate in discussions** with classmates, whether in person or asynchronously online
4. **Manage basic computer tasks** like saving files, opening documents, and using a web browser
5. **Attend class regularly** or communicate when you need accommodations
6. **Ask for help** when you need clarification or support

If any of these feel challenging, that's okay—but you should let me know early so we can connect you with appropriate support resources (see [[accommodations-policy-course-v101]] for details).

## Learning to "Invent the University"

As composition scholar David Bartholomae explains, every time you write in college, you're learning to speak in ways that feel unfamiliar—to "invent the university" for yourself by trying on new ways of thinking, arguing, and presenting ideas. This process is difficult for everyone, not just students who lack preparation.

What you're learning in this course is how to:
- Recognize when you're encountering unfamiliar discourse patterns
- Treat that difficulty as informational (it tells you what you're learning)
- Develop strategies for working through resistance rather than avoiding it
- Build a corpus of your own writing that you can learn from

This happens through practice, reflection, and accumulation—not through memorizing rules or imitating models.

## If You're Worried About Being "Behind"

If you're concerned that other students have more preparation than you do, here's what to keep in mind:

**The course design levels the playing field.** Many course activities—like process documentation, constraint analysis, and corpus building—will be new to everyone, regardless of previous writing experience.

**Your prior experience may help in some ways and create challenges in others.** Students with extensive writing experience sometimes need to unlearn habits that don't transfer well to college contexts. Students with less experience often approach new concepts with productive openness.

**The course values process evidence, not just polished products.** Your development logs, reflective writing, and documentation of your learning process matter as much as your final drafts. This means learning itself is visible and valued.

**Support is available.** If you need additional help, WSU provides writing center services, library research support, and disability accommodations (see [[accommodations-policy-course-v101]]). Using these resources is a sign of strategic thinking, not weakness.

---

## What Success Looks Like

By the end of the semester, successful students will have:
- Written regularly (3-4 fragments per week) to build a corpus of 40-50 text pieces
- Documented their writing process through development logs
- Given and received structured peer feedback
- Reflected on their own learning and growth
- Assembled a portfolio showing both process and product

These outcomes are achievable regardless of your starting point. The key is consistent engagement with the work, not arriving with specific preparation.
