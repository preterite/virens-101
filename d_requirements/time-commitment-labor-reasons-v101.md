## Design Rationale

The time commitment specified for VIRENS 101—5-6 hours per week over 15 weeks—reflects three principles: (1) transparency about labor expectations, (2) alignment with federal credit hour definitions while honoring composition's distinct character as practice-based learning, and (3) explicit valuing of writing-as-verb (composing labor) alongside writing-as-noun (textual products).

The distributed workload structure (consistent weekly engagement rather than episodic deadline-driven bursts) emerges from research showing that writing skill develops through regular practice over time, not through intensive effort before deadlines. By making labor expectations explicit and building them into course structure rather than leaving them implicit, the design reduces inequitable "hidden curriculum" effects where students with more cultural capital better understand unstated expectations.

Additionally, transparent time expectations allow students to make informed decisions about course enrollment given other commitments (employment, caregiving, athletics) and enable realistic planning rather than discover workload through trial and error.

## Theoretical Grounding

### Composition Pedagogy and Labor

**Inoue's Labor-Based Grading Framework:**
Asao Inoue's *Labor-Based Grading Contracts* argues that conventional assessment systems mask the labor of writing beneath judgments of quality, creating systems where dominant language users have advantages invisible to grading mechanisms. His alternative framework makes labor visible and central:

> "What I'm asking is that we shift our attention from the quality of student writing to the labor students do, and that we do so in ways that help students understand that the labor they do—the time and energy they put into reading and writing—is valuable and should be acknowledged and rewarded."

VIRENS 101 operationalizes this insight by:
- Specifying expected weekly labor hours (5-6 hours total)
- Making process documentation (dev logs, system maps) worth substantial course credit
- Valuing fragment production regardless of polish level (quantity and consistency matter)
- Assessing both writing-as-verb (process) and writing-as-noun (product)

The 50/50 portfolio/formative split (see [[grading-assessment-reasons-v101]]) ensures that labor itself counts toward course success, not just quality of final products.

**Sommers on Revision as Ongoing Process:**
Nancy Sommers's research on revision demonstrates that experienced writers treat writing as extended process rather than discrete episodes. Her longitudinal study tracking Harvard undergraduates found that students who developed strong revision practices understood writing as continuous engagement rather than assignment completion.

VIRENS 101's distributed workload reflects this insight: 3-4 fragments per week over 15 weeks builds writing as ongoing practice rather than episodic response to deadlines. This rhythm more closely approximates how experienced writers work—regularly, incrementally, with frequent returns to earlier material.

The fragment accumulation model (40-50 pieces by Week 12) requires this distributed approach. Students can't produce authentic corpus through weekend cramming; they must write regularly to accumulate material worth curating.

**Perl's Composing Processes Research:**
Sondra Perl's case studies of composing processes established that writing involves recursive, non-linear movement between planning, drafting, and revising—not linear progression from outline to final draft. Her concept of "felt sense" suggests that writers need time between writing sessions to develop tacit understanding of what they want to say.

The course's distributed workload honors this reality: writing one fragment per day with space between sessions allows felt sense to develop. The daily writing practice (20-30 minutes suggested) provides regular engagement without demanding multi-hour sessions that can become counterproductive.

Process documentation (dev logs 2× per week) captures this recursive movement, making writers' non-linear processes visible to themselves and instructors.

### Skill Acquisition and Distributed Practice

**Flower's Cognitive Process Theory:**
Linda Flower's research on writing as problem-solving established that composing involves complex cognitive processes that improve through deliberate practice over time. Skill development requires:
- Frequent engagement (practice opportunities)
- Varied contexts (different rhetorical situations)
- Metacognitive reflection (thinking about thinking)
- Gradual increase in complexity (scaffolded challenge)

VIRENS 101's workload structure provides all four:
- **Frequent engagement**: Daily writing encouraged, 3-4 fragments per week required
- **Varied contexts**: Fragments respond to different readings, serve different purposes
- **Metacognitive reflection**: Dev logs make process visible; portfolio reflection analyzes patterns
- **Gradual complexity**: Constraint sequencing means new demands arrive when students are ready

The 5-6 hours per week provides enough time for this developmental work without overwhelming students.

## Implementation Approach

### Making Labor Visible and Valued

**Explicit Time Budgets:**
The course content note provides detailed breakdown of where time goes: reading (1-1.5 hrs), writing (1.5-2 hrs), process documentation (30-45 min), peer review (30 min when active), organization (15-30 min). This transparency serves multiple purposes:

1. **Equity**: Students from non-academic backgrounds may not know how much time college writing typically requires. Explicit guidance levels the playing field.

2. **Planning**: Students with jobs, caregiving, or athletics can make informed decisions about whether the workload is manageable given their constraints.

3. **Calibration**: If students report spending dramatically more or less time than expected, instructor can investigate whether assignments are well-calibrated.

4. **Validation**: Naming process documentation and organization as legitimate labor (not just "real" writing) validates work that often goes unrecognized.

**Assessment of Labor:**
The formative assessment component (50% of grade) includes:
- Fragment production (completion-based with quality baseline)
- Development log frequency (2× per week required)
- Peer review participation (Eli Review cycles)
- Portfolio reflective materials

This assessment structure ensures that labor itself is valued, not just products that emerge from labor.

**Weekly Rhythms:**
The predictable weekly structure (reading→writing→documenting→organizing) helps students develop sustainable habits rather than reactive deadline-chasing. Consistency matters more than intensity.

### Acknowledging Diverse Student Lives

**Employment:**
Approximately 60-70% of college students work for pay, with many working 20+ hours per week. The distributed workload acknowledges this reality:
- 30-minute writing blocks work around shift schedules
- Weekend time can substitute for weeknight time
- In-class writing time maximizes instructional contact hours

However, full-time employment (40+ hrs/week) plus full course load (12-15 credits) plus VIRENS 101's requirements may exceed sustainable capacity. The course content note addresses this directly rather than ignoring it.

**Caregiving:**
Students with children or elder care responsibilities face unpredictable time demands. The course design provides flexibility:
- Late work accepted (with graduated penalties) rather than rejected
- Dev logs can be audio-recorded rather than written
- Fragment production can happen in scattered small sessions

However, the distributed workload can't be compressed into occasional long sessions. Students with significant caregiving responsibilities need to assess whether they can manage consistent weekly engagement.

**Athletic and Performance Commitments:**
Student athletes and performers face predictable schedule conflicts (travel, competitions, rehearsals). The distributed workload actually benefits these students: advance production of extra fragments creates buffer for competition weeks.

The key is advance planning and communication rather than crisis accommodation.

## Competing Values & Tradeoffs

### Realism vs. Aspiration

**Tension:**
Standard credit hour calculation (1 hour class + 2-3 hours homework per credit) assumes full-time student status. Many students work part-time or full-time, reducing available study time.

**Resolution:**
The course acknowledges this tension directly in student-facing materials while maintaining institutional standard. The 5-6 hour expectation is realistic for course goals, but instructor recognizes that students may need to negotiate competing demands strategically.

Flexibility mechanisms (late work policies, alternative documentation formats) provide some adaptability without abandoning expectation that consistent engagement is necessary for skill development.

### Distributed Practice vs. Student Autonomy

**Tension:**
Research clearly shows distributed practice produces better learning than massed practice, but imposing frequent small deadlines can feel controlling or reduce student autonomy.

**Resolution:**
The course structures distributed practice through fragment targets (3-4 per week) and dev log frequency (2× per week) while leaving students substantial autonomy about *when* during the week they do the work.

Additionally, the late work policy (graduated penalties rather than rejection) allows students to shift their own deadlines when needed, though with costs that incentivize timeliness.

### Transparency vs. Overwhelming Detail

**Tension:**
Detailed time breakdowns help students plan, but too much specificity can feel overwhelming or create anxiety about "doing it right."

**Resolution:**
The course content note provides detailed guidance framed as estimates ("typically," "approximately") rather than rigid requirements. Students need enough information to plan realistically without feeling micromanaged.

Follow-up check-ins (Week 4, Week 8) allow calibration based on actual student experience rather than theoretical time budgets.

## Evidence & Iteration

### Evidence to Collect

- [ ] Time diary data from volunteer students (actual hours vs. expected)
- [ ] Student self-reports of workload manageability at Week 4, Week 8, Week 15
- [ ] Completion rates for various labor components (fragments, dev logs, peer review)
- [ ] Correlation between labor investment and course outcomes
- [ ] Patterns in late work: Which assignments most frequently submitted late? Why?
- [ ] Student reflections on distributed practice vs. deadline-driven work

### Revision Notes

**Future considerations:**
- Are time estimates accurate based on student experience?
- Does distributed workload structure actually produce better learning than traditional deadline-based structure?
- Do flexibility mechanisms (late work, alternative formats) adequately support students with complex lives?
- Are there hidden workload components not captured in time estimates?
- How do workload perceptions vary by student background (first-generation, working students, parents, athletes)?

**Potential adjustments:**
- If students consistently report spending more time than expected, either reduce requirements or adjust expectations
- If students report episodic rather than distributed engagement, strengthen incentives for consistent work
- If particular components (dev logs, peer review) feel burdensome without proportional value, recalibrate or eliminate
