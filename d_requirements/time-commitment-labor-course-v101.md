## What "3 Credits" Means in Practice

English 101 is a 3-credit course. According to standard federal guidelines, each credit hour should involve:
- **1 hour of class time per week** (for us: 2.5 hours in class)
- **2-3 hours of work outside class per week** (reading, writing, documenting)

**Total expected time commitment: 5-6 hours per week** (class time + homework)

Over a 15-week semester, that's roughly **75-90 hours of total work**. This includes everything: attending class, reading, writing fragments, peer review, process documentation, and portfolio assembly.

This is a realistic, achievable workload for a 3-credit course—but it does require consistent engagement. You can't cram composition the way you might for an exam-based course.

## Breaking Down the Weekly Time Commitment

A typical week involves:

### In-Class Time (2.5 hours)
- **Writing and production**: 60-70% of class time spent actually writing, revising, or workshop activities
- **Discussion and instruction**: 20-30% on introducing concepts, discussing readings, or mini-lessons
- **Administrative/organizational**: 10% on logistics, questions, housekeeping

### Out-of-Class Time (3-4 hours)
**Reading** (1-1.5 hours):
- 40-60 pages per week maximum
- Mix of composition theory, example texts, and technique readings
- Includes time for loose notes or reading responses

**Writing** (1.5-2 hours):
- 3-4 fragments per week (each 150-400 words)
- Most intensive writing happens in class; outside work often involves developing fragments started in class

**Process Documentation** (30-45 minutes):
- Development logs (2× per week, 10-15 minutes each)
- Occasionally: system maps, spec documents, or workflow reflections

**Peer Review** (~30 minutes, when cycles are active):
- Giving structured feedback through Eli Review (Weeks 5-14, approximately every 2 weeks)
- Processing feedback you receive from peers

**Organization and Maintenance** (15-30 minutes):
- Organizing index cards
- Maintaining folder structure in OneDrive
- Updating Zotero library
- Checking Canvas for announcements

## Why This Course Requires Consistent Work

Unlike courses where you can study intensively before exams, composition requires **distributed practice**—regular engagement over time. Here's why:

**Writing is a skill, not information**: You can't learn to write by reading about writing or by cramming before a deadline. You develop fluency through repeated practice, just like learning an instrument or a sport.

**Corpus building requires accumulation**: The course asks you to produce 40-50 fragments by Week 12. That requires steady production (3-4 per week), not heroic bursts. Starting a week before the portfolio is due won't work.

**Process documentation must be concurrent**: Development logs need to be written close to the work they document. You can't reconstruct three weeks of process decisions from memory.

**Feedback cycles have fixed timelines**: When you submit work for peer review in Eli Review, classmates need your draft on time to give feedback. Late submissions disrupt the system and shortchange your peers.

**Reflection requires distance**: Portfolio assembly (Weeks 12-15) involves selecting from and analyzing your accumulated corpus. You need time between producing fragments and evaluating them.

## Where Time Goes: Fragment Production

The core labor of this course is fragment production—writing 40-50 short pieces (150-400 words each) over the semester. Here's what that looks like:

**Weeks 1-3** (Movement 1: Surfacing): 8-12 fragments
- Focus: Fast capture, exploration, freewriting
- Many fragments started in class
- Emphasis on quantity over polish

**Weeks 4-7** (Movement 2: Naming): 12-16 fragments  
- Focus: Source engagement, categorization, structured feedback
- More deliberate development
- Quality baseline emerges

**Weeks 8-11** (Movement 3: Operating at Scale): 12-16 fragments
- Focus: Consolidation, corpus management
- Strategic selection of what to develop
- Intensive revision of selected pieces

**Weeks 12-15** (Movement 4: Synthesis): 4-8 new fragments + portfolio work
- Focus: Polish, selection, reflection
- Assembling final portfolio
- Comparative analysis of own patterns

**Fragment production pace**: Most students report spending 20-40 minutes per fragment once they develop a rhythm. Early fragments take longer as you learn the form; later fragments go faster.

## Workload Intensification Points

Some weeks require more work than others. Here are the predictable heavy weeks:

**Week 5**: First graded Eli Review cycle + Zotero instruction
- Slightly above normal workload as you learn new systems

**Week 8**: Mid-semester + "What You're Automating" session
- Time to audit your corpus and organize digital systems
- Good checkpoint for catching up if you've fallen behind

**Week 12-13**: Portfolio assembly intensive work
- Selecting polished pieces from corpus
- Writing reflective cover letter
- Organizing portfolio materials

**Finals Week**: Portfolio submission + final reflections
- Most work is selection and presentation, not new writing
- Should be less intense than traditional exam studying if you've kept up with corpus building

## Managing Your Time

### Strategies That Work

**Daily writing practice**: 20-30 minutes per day (6 days/week) produces more than trying to write everything on Sunday afternoon. The course structure supports this rhythm.

**Use in-class time strategically**: Most writing happens during class. If you're fully present and productive during our 2.5 hours together, your outside workload decreases significantly.

**Process docs as you go**: Write dev logs immediately after work sessions (10 minutes) rather than trying to reconstruct process later.

**Read actively, not carefully**: Focus on getting main ideas and making connections, not on memorizing or analyzing deeply. Readings inform your writing; they're not exam material.

**Front-load early weeks**: Produce extra fragments in Weeks 1-4 when expectations are lower. This creates buffer for later weeks.

### Red Flags You're Falling Behind

- Haven't produced any fragments outside class time
- Development logs more than a week overdue
- Skipping assigned readings consistently
- Missing Eli Review deadlines (this affects classmates, not just you)
- Unorganized folder structure making it hard to find your work

**If you notice these patterns**: Come talk to me. We can develop a catch-up plan before you're too far behind to recover.

## Work-Life Balance Considerations

### For Students with Jobs

**20+ hours/week employment**: You can succeed in this course, but you'll need disciplined time management. Use weekends strategically; protect some writing time before/after shifts.

**Full-time employment**: Challenging but possible. Consider: Can you reduce hours temporarily during heavy weeks (5, 8, 12-13)? Can you use break time for reading? Be realistic about your capacity.

### For Students with Caregiving Responsibilities

The distributed workload actually benefits students with caregiving responsibilities—you can write fragments in 30-minute blocks rather than needing multi-hour writing sessions. But you need backup plans for when children are sick or family needs arise.

Flex policies help: late work accepted (with penalties), dev logs can be audio recorded if writing isn't possible, and some in-class activities allow remote participation if you communicate in advance.

### For Student Athletes or Performers

Travel and performance schedules create predictable conflicts. If you know you'll miss class or have competition weeks, plan ahead:
- Produce extra fragments before travel
- Complete Eli Review cycles early
- Communicate schedule conflicts at semester start

The key is advance planning, not last-minute accommodation requests.

## What This Workload Buys You

The time you invest produces:

**Immediate value**:
- 40-50 pieces of writing (a substantial portfolio of intellectual work)
- Skills in citation management, peer feedback, and process documentation
- Improved writing fluency and confidence
- Better understanding of your own composing processes

**Transfer value**:
- Writing habits (daily practice, process documentation) transferable to other courses
- Citation and source management skills for research in any discipline
- Peer collaboration strategies for group work
- Self-assessment capabilities for ongoing learning

**Long-term value**:
- Digital corpus you can mine for future courses or projects
- Documentation of your intellectual development (portfolio as proof)
- Metacognitive awareness of how you learn and work
- Tools and practices you can continue using after the course

This isn't busywork. Every hour invested builds capability and produces intellectual capital you own.
