## Abstract Flexibility Notes

**Holiday/flex blocks**: 2 blocks reserved for Monday/Tuesday holidays (every semester has ~2). Absorb into adjacent weeks or use as catch-up.

**Spring/Fall variation**: Conference week (9) and Presentations week (14) remain stable. Spring Break or Thanksgiving falls mid-semester; schedule accommodates either.

**Meeting pattern agnostic**: Designed at 25-min block level. Works as 1×150, 2×75, or 3×50.

## Files Needing Updates

| File | Change Needed |
|------|---------------|
| `peer-review-cycle4-beam-source-entries-criteria-course-v101.md` | Change "Week: 9" to "Week: 8" |
| `instructor-prompt-block9-4-conference-questions-course-v101.md` | Add note: homework TO conference week |
| Student reading -reasons- files | Update difficulty pair documentation |

---

## Next Steps

1. Generate weekly index notes (`i_week01/` through `i_week15/`)
2. Create semester schedule overview for `i_schedule/`
3. Update peer review and prompt files as noted above
4. Complete reading schedule documentation in `g_studentreadings/`
