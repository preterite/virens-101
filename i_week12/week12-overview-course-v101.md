## This Week's Place in the Course

Week 12 marks the transition into Movement 4, where accumulation gives way to synthesis. Students have spent eleven weeks building systems—capturing fragments, classifying sources, routing material through folders and feedback cycles. Now they examine what they've made and decide what deserves final form. Norman's vocabulary of affordances, signifiers, and discoverability provides tools for this examination, helping students see their own work as designed objects that must communicate to readers.

The Documented Inquiry reaches completion this week, representing the first major piece to emerge fully from the BEAM Portfolio work. Process Archaeology begins, turning Norman's analytical lens on students' own writing processes. Portfolio selection starts exploratorily—not committing yet, but examining the corpus through design principles.

**Key transition**: From building systems to selecting from them. From writing-as-verb to evaluating writing-as-noun.

## Synthesis

We've spent eleven weeks building systems: capturing fragments, classifying sources, routing material through folders and feedback cycles, connecting ideas across your growing corpus. This week marks a turn. Movement 4 asks you to stop building and start selecting—to examine what you've made and decide what deserves final form. Donald Norman's vocabulary from *The Design of Everyday Things* provides tools for this examination, helping you see your own work as designed object.

Norman distinguishes between affordances and signifiers with characteristic precision: "Affordances determine what actions are possible. Signifiers communicate where the action should take place. We need both." A door handle affords pulling; a flat plate affords pushing. But the handle also *signifies*—it tells you, without words, what action to take. Good design makes affordances visible through clear signifiers. Poor design hides possibilities or misleads about what's possible.

Apply this to your portfolio. What does your accumulated work *afford*? You have fragments, sources, peer feedback, revision histories, workflow logs. These materials afford many possible portfolios—you could showcase growth, demonstrate range, highlight your strongest analytical work, or document your developing research process. The affordances are there, latent in the corpus. But which affordances will you make visible? What will your portfolio *signify* to readers about how to engage with it?

Norman frames this as a question of discoverability: "When we interact with a product, we need to figure out how to work it. This means discovering what it does, how it works, and what operations are possible: discoverability." When readers encounter your portfolio, can they discover what it does? Can they figure out how to navigate it, what's inside, how pieces connect? A portfolio that requires extensive explanation before readers can engage with it has a discoverability problem—the design isn't doing enough work.

This connects to Alexander's [[@alexander1964notet]] goodness of fit from Week 7. Alexander argued that good design achieves fit between form and context by eliminating misfits—the places where form fails to serve context. Norman extends this: good design makes the right actions easy and the wrong actions difficult. When you're selecting portfolio material, you're asking a goodness-of-fit question: does this fragment fit the portfolio's purpose? Does the portfolio's organization fit readers' expectations? Where are the misfits—the places where your current draft fails to serve its intended function?

The Documented Inquiry you're completing this week represents a different kind of design challenge. Unlike fragments that serve your own thinking, the Documented Inquiry addresses readers who don't share your research journey. It must make your inquiry *discoverable*—not just present conclusions but show how you arrived at them, what sources complicated your thinking, where questions remain open. The assignment asks you to signify your research process through the writing itself, making visible the invisible work of genuine inquiry.

This is the corpse-to-garden transformation at scale. Your BEAM Portfolio gathered sources; your Documented Inquiry brings them into dialogue, makes them argue and complicate and illuminate. Material that existed as isolated entries now lives in relationship. The inquiry doesn't just report what sources say—it puts you in conversation with them, examining their evidence, questioning their assumptions, tracing how your own understanding evolved through engagement. Dead accumulation becomes living argument.

But the Documented Inquiry also reveals something about writing-as-verb and writing-as-noun. The inquiry you submit is frozen—a noun, a product, something that can be evaluated against criteria. Yet the inquiry emerged from process—verb, activity, the ongoing work of reading and thinking and revising. Norman's vocabulary helps here too: the submitted inquiry is what readers encounter, but what they're really evaluating is whether the writing affords genuine intellectual engagement. Does it signal that real thinking happened? Can readers discover not just your conclusions but your reasoning?

This week introduces Process Archaeology, which turns Norman's lens on your own writing process. Just as Norman examines everyday objects to understand why they work or fail, Process Archaeology examines your semester's work to understand what your process afforded and constrained. The archaeology won't be complete this week—you're gathering materials, identifying significant moments, beginning to construct an account. But Norman's vocabulary gives you tools: What did your workflow afford? What signified the right next action? Where were the discoverability problems—places where you couldn't figure out what to do next? Where did your system achieve goodness of fit, and where did misfits persist?

Exploratory selection of portfolio materials begins this week. You're not committing yet—you're examining your corpus through Norman's lens, asking what it affords and what might best signify your learning. The selection criteria you articulate matter as much as the selections themselves. What counts as portfolio-worthy for you? Is it polish? Risk-taking? Evidence of growth? The criteria reveal your conceptual model of what the portfolio should do.

Norman notes that good conceptual models don't have to be complete or accurate—they have to be useful. Your model of your own portfolio is still forming. This week begins the synthesis work that will occupy Movement 4: selecting, arranging, polishing, making discoverable the thinking that's been accumulating all semester.

## Reading

### Primary Text

**Donald Norman, *The Design of Everyday Things*, Chapter 1: "The Psychopathology of Everyday Things"** (~15 pages)

Norman introduces core design concepts—affordances, signifiers, mappings, feedback, conceptual models—through analysis of everyday objects like doors, stoves, and watches. His central argument: when people struggle with objects, the problem is usually design failure, not user failure. This reframes "user error" as diagnostic information about where design doesn't fit human cognition and action.

**Reading focus**: Pay attention to how Norman moves from concrete examples (doors that confuse, watches with too many buttons) to abstract principles (affordances, signifiers, discoverability). Notice how he treats difficulty not as user deficiency but as design signal. Consider how these principles apply to your own writing—both as designed object and as process you've been navigating.

### Connecting to Course Concepts

Norman extends several threads from earlier weeks:

| Prior Concept | Norman's Extension |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Goodness of fit (Alexander, W7) | Affordances and signifiers operationalize fit—good design affords intended use and signifies how to achieve it |
| Infrastructure invisibility (Star, W10) | Norman's "discoverability" is infrastructure made visible—users can discover what's possible |
| Difficulty as diagnostic (Salvatori, W3) | Norman treats user difficulty as design feedback, not user failure |
| Writing-as-verb/noun | Designed objects are frozen (noun) but must afford action (verb) |

## ONESIES: New Concept Introduction

### Affordances

**Definition**: Affordances are the possible interactions between people and environment—what actions an object, system, or situation makes possible. A chair affords sitting; a flat surface affords writing; a handle affords pulling. Affordances exist whether or not users perceive them, but *perceived* affordances shape what users actually do.

**Signifiers** communicate affordances—they signal where and how to act. A "PUSH" sign is a signifier. So is a door handle's shape. Good design makes affordances perceivable through clear signifiers; poor design hides affordances or provides misleading signifiers.

**Application to writing**: Your accumulated corpus affords many possible portfolios, arguments, and projects. The question is which affordances you'll make visible through selection and arrangement. Your portfolio's organization signifies to readers how to engage—clear signifiers help readers discover what's possible; unclear signifiers create confusion.

**Application to process**: Your writing workflow afforded certain actions and constrained others. Index cards afford quick capture but not long-form drafting. Folders afford organization but can hide connections. Process Archaeology examines what your system afforded and where signifiers were clear or confusing.

**Key quotation**: "Affordances determine what actions are possible. Signifiers communicate where the action should take place. We need both" (Norman 14).

## Block-by-Block Plan

### Block 1 (W): Documented Inquiry Drafting

**Opening** (3 min): Brief orientation to the week's M4 transition. Today focuses on completing Documented Inquiry drafts for peer review. Remind students this is inquiry-driven writing—the goal is making research process discoverable, not just presenting conclusions.

**Main** (20 min): Documented Inquiry drafting. Students work on their inquiries, focusing on:
- Integrating BEAM sources dialogically (not just summarizing)
- Making research pathway visible (how thinking evolved)
- Maintaining inquiry stance (genuine questions, not predetermined thesis)

**Closing** (2 min): Checkpoint: Are you showing how your thinking developed, or just reporting conclusions? Drafts due before Block 3 for peer review.

---

### Block 2 (W): Continue Documented Inquiry

**Opening** (2 min): Quick troubleshooting. Common issues: reverting to thesis-driven structure, hiding process, treating sources extractively rather than dialogically.

**Main** (21 min): Continue drafting. Instructor circulates for brief consultations. Students should be completing drafts for submission before Block 3.

**Closing** (2 min): Reminder: Submit drafts to Eli Review before next block. Peer review uses DES (Describe-Evaluate-Suggest) protocol—evaluative feedback for advanced analytical work.

---

### Block 3 (P): Eli Review Cycle 6 — Documented Inquiry

**Opening** (3 min): Orient to DES protocol for evaluative feedback. This is advanced research writing with clear criteria:
- Is the inquiry focused on genuine questions?
- Are sources integrated dialogically?
- Is research pathway visible without excessive narration?
- Does conclusion acknowledge complexity rather than forcing certainty?

**Main** (20 min): Peer review in Eli Review. Students provide DES feedback on 2-3 peer inquiries, focusing on where analysis needs depth, source engagement needs development, or organization needs clarity.

**Closing** (2 min): Reflective One-Pager #4 assigned—due after completing peer review. Reflect on what feedback revealed about your inquiry's discoverability.

> [!note] Instructor Prompt Available
> **Prompt 12.3**: Portfolio Selection Criteria (see Block 5)

---

### Block 4 (R): Revision + Portfolio Assembly Touch

**Opening** (3 min): Review feedback received. What patterns emerge? Where do multiple readers identify the same issues?

**Main** (12 min): Revision based on peer feedback. Focus on the most substantive concerns—where does your inquiry's discoverability need work?

**Portfolio Assembly Logistics** (10 min): Brief orientation to portfolio requirements and timeline:
- What goes in the portfolio (major assignments + selected fragments + process evidence)
- How pieces connect (framing prose, not just collection)
- Timeline for remaining weeks (selection → assembly → polish)

**Closing** (2 min): Transition to exploratory selection next block.

---

### Block 5 (R): Portfolio Selection Begins

**Opening** (3 min): Introduce portfolio selection through Norman's lens. Your corpus affords many possible portfolios. Today you examine what you have and begin articulating selection criteria.

**Main** (20 min): 
**Prompt 12.3 — Portfolio Selection Criteria**

> Identify 2-3 specific fragments from your corpus that you believe deserve portfolio inclusion; for each, briefly explain what makes it portfolio-worthy; then step back and articulate the selection criteria you're discovering through these examples—what counts as evidence of excellence? Progress? Your idiosyncratic perspective that shows how you've been learning?

Students work through their corpus, identifying candidates and articulating emerging criteria.

**Closing** (2 min): Share one selection criterion with a neighbor. Notice: criteria vary. Some emphasize polish, others growth, others risk-taking. All can be valid if defensible.

---

### Block 6 (R): Process Archaeology Drafting Begins

**Opening** (5 min): Introduce Process Archaeology through Norman's vocabulary. Just as Norman examines everyday objects to understand why they work or fail, you'll examine your semester's writing process. Key questions:
- What did your workflow afford and constrain?
- What signified the right next action?
- Where were the discoverability problems?
- Where did your system achieve goodness of fit?

**Main** (18 min): Begin Process Archaeology work:
- Review workflow logs, revision histories, folder structures
- Identify 2-3 significant moments (breakthroughs, breakdowns, surprises)
- Start drafting observations using Norman's vocabulary

**Closing** (2 min): Process Archaeology continues next week. For now, you're gathering material and identifying patterns—the full analysis comes in Week 13.

## Assignments

### Documented Inquiry (Major Portfolio Assignment)

**Due**: Draft before Block 3 (for peer review); revised version mid-week

**Description**: Sustained inquiry (1800-2500 words) drawing on BEAM Portfolio sources. Inquiry-driven rather than thesis-driven: begin with questions, trace how thinking evolved, engage sources dialogically, conclude honestly about where inquiry has led.

**Key requirements**:
- Integrate 6-10 sources using BEAM distinctions purposefully
- Make research pathway visible without excessive narration
- Demonstrate genuine inquiry (questions, not predetermined conclusions)
- Engage sources dialogically (examine claims/evidence, not just summarize)

**Connection to Week 12**: Norman's discoverability applies—can readers discover not just your conclusions but your reasoning? Does the writing signify that real inquiry happened?

See: [[documented-inquiry-assignment-course-v101]]

---

### Reflective One-Pager #4

**Due**: After completing Cycle 6 peer review

**Focus**: What did peer feedback reveal about your Documented Inquiry's discoverability? Where do readers struggle to follow your reasoning? What does this suggest about revision priorities?

---

### Process Archaeology (Begins)

**Due**: Week 13

**This week**: Begin gathering materials (workflow logs, revision histories, significant fragments). Identify 2-3 moments worth examining. Start drafting observations using Norman's vocabulary.

See: [[process-archaeology-assignment-course-v101]]

---

## Peer Review: Cycle 6

**Protocol**: DES (Describe-Evaluate-Suggest) — Evaluative feedback for advanced analytical work

**Focus areas**:
- Inquiry focus: Does the piece investigate genuine questions, or revert to thesis-driven argument?
- Source engagement: Are sources integrated dialogically, or just summarized?
- Process visibility: Is research pathway visible without excessive narration?
- Conclusion: Does it acknowledge complexity, or force artificial certainty?

**Rationale**: Documented Inquiry is portfolio-level work with clear criteria. Evaluative feedback provides directive suggestions about where analysis needs depth, source engagement needs development, or organization needs clarity.

## Concept Connections

### Norman ↔ Alexander (Goodness of Fit)

Norman's affordances extend Alexander's form/context relationship:

| Alexander | Norman |
|-----------|--------|
| Form must fit context | Design must afford intended use |
| Misfits signal where form fails | Difficulty signals where design fails |
| Good fit = absence of misfits | Good design = clear affordances + signifiers |
| Context defines requirements | Users define what "works" |

Both treat difficulty diagnostically: when users struggle, the problem is design misfit, not user failure.

### Writing-as-Verb/Noun in M4

The M3→M4 transition foregrounds the verb/noun tension:

| Writing-as-Verb | Writing-as-Noun |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| Ongoing process | Frozen product |
| What you did all semester | What portfolio contains |
| Affords continued revision | Must signify to readers |
| Known through doing | Evaluated against criteria |

Portfolio selection asks: which frozen products (noun) best represent your process (verb)? What will signify your learning to readers who didn't witness it?

### Corpse→Garden: Documented Inquiry

The Documented Inquiry completes a transformation arc:

| Stage | Form | Status |
|-------|------|--------|
| BEAM Portfolio entries | Individual source analyses | Accumulated material |
| Pattern identification | Synthesis observations | Connections emerging |
| Documented Inquiry | Sustained argument | Living dialogue |

Sources that existed as isolated entries now argue, complicate, and illuminate in relationship. This is textual accumulation's payoff—fragments become fabric.

## Looking Ahead

**Week 13**: Process Archaeology reaches completion. Bernstein's "revision as meaning-making" provides vocabulary for understanding how revision transforms rather than just corrects. Permission flags receive full treatment—examining how the constraint system has evolved across the semester. Portfolio assembly continues.

**Week 14**: Presentations. Students share portfolio selections and Process Archaeology insights.

**Week 15**: Final portfolio submission. Reflective cover letter synthesizes semester learning.
