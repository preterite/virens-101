## This Week's Place in the Course

Week 9 pauses collective work for individual conversations. No class sessions meet; instead, each student schedules a 30-minute conference to discuss progress, challenges, and directions for remaining work. This threshold moment falls deliberately between Movement 2 (Naming) and Movement 3 (Operating at Scale)—a chance to take stock before the course's demands increase.

The conference is where feedback becomes dialogic. You've received peer feedback through review cycles and self-assessed through development logs. Now you get direct instructor feedback—not just comments on submitted work, but conversation about your understanding of your own process. This is a different kind of visibility: you're making your thinking available, not just your writing.

---

## Synthesis

Taking stock requires pausing production. Systems can't be adjusted without observation, and the mid-semester conference creates space to observe: where are you, what's working, what needs attention, where do you want to go?

This is also a moment to revisit what revision means. Revision is not editing—not surface correction, not proofreading, not fixing errors. Revision is *re-seeing*: reconceiving what a piece of writing could become. The word's etymology makes this literal: *re-* (again) + *vision* (seeing). To revise is to see again, with different eyes, from a different angle, with new questions.

Revision as re-seeing opens possibilities rather than closing them. Where editing asks "is this correct?", revision asks "what else could this be?" Where editing polishes what exists, revision explores what might exist. A piece of writing at mid-semester isn't a fixed object needing repair—it's material with potential directions, some visible and some not yet discovered. The conference is a chance to discover directions together: what do you see in your work that I might not? What do I see that you haven't noticed?

This understanding of revision sets up work you'll encounter later in the course. In Week 13, Charles Bernstein will offer a more radical metaphor—writing as "psychic surgery," revision as animation of dead material into living text. For now, hold onto this: revision is generative, not corrective. It opens rather than closes. The question isn't "what's wrong?" but "what's possible?"

## Conference Structure

Each conference runs 30 minutes, with 25 minutes of discussion and a 5-minute break before the next student.

**Typical flow**:

| Time | Focus |
|------|-------|
| 5 min | Academic interests, background, priorities—who you are as a student |
| 5-10 min | Gradebook review—where you stand, what's complete, what's missing |
| 15+ min | Your questions, your directions, your work—what matters to you |

**What to bring**:
- Your completed Conference Prep fragment (questions + directions in both formats)
- Any specific work you want to discuss
- Questions about concepts, assignments, or workflow

**What you'll leave with**:
- Instructor summary email recapping our conversation
- Concrete next steps for M3 work
- Clearer sense of your direction for the remaining semester

## Assignments

### Conference Prep Fragment (Due: Before Meeting)

**Description**: Respond to two questions—"What questions do you want to explore in your conference?" and "What directions interest you for remaining work?"—presenting one as structured data (list, table, bullets) and one as organized prose. Include 2-3 sentences explaining your format choices.

**Purpose**: Generates productive conference material while practicing rhetorical awareness about format decisions.

### Conference Response Email (Due: End of Week 9)

**Description**: After your conference, send a response email that includes:

1. **Key takeaways**: 2-3 things from our conversation that you want to remember
2. **Planning checklist**: Specific action items for your M3 work, with target dates where possible
3. **Questions that emerged**: Anything that came up after the conference that you're still thinking about

**Format**: Literal email sent to instructor (not a fragment submitted elsewhere).

**Purpose**: Converts the conference from "thing that happened" to "thing that generates forward motion." The planning checklist makes commitments concrete; writing it yourself (rather than just receiving my summary) ensures you own the plan.

**Connection to dev logs**: This response email models the kind of planning documentation that feeds into your development log practice. The checklist format—specific actions, target dates, open questions—is exactly what effective dev log entries look like. Consider copying your checklist into your dev log as the first M3 entry.

## Feedback at Midpoint

The conference completes a feedback triangle:

| Source | What It Provides |
|--------|------------------|
| **Peer feedback** (M2 cycles) | Reader response; how your writing lands with audience |
| **Self-assessment** (dev logs) | Process awareness; what you notice about your own patterns |
| **Instructor feedback** (conference) | Expert diagnosis; what experienced eyes see in your work |

Each source offers something the others can't. Peers read as genuine audience but may lack diagnostic vocabulary. Self-assessment captures process but can't see blind spots. Instructor feedback brings expertise but can't know your experience from inside.

The conference combines these: you bring your self-assessment (the prep fragment), we discuss your work together (expert feedback), and you've had peer response on earlier drafts. The planning checklist you create afterward synthesizes all three sources into forward action.

## Looking Ahead

**Week 10**: Movement 3 begins. Star's [[@star1999ethnp]] "Ethnography of Infrastructure" and Bush's [[@bush1945thinl]] "As We May Think" introduce concepts for the remaining semester: infrastructure visibility, boundary objects, the memex vision. The course's pace increases; the conference should help you prepare.

**Remaining semester**: Documented Inquiry development (M3), Process Archaeology (M4), final portfolio. The directions you identify this week shape that work.
