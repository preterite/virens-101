## Synthesis

You've been accumulating. Fragments scattered across your folder, a Literacy Narrative drafted, source-based writing begun with SEAR. This week asks a different question: given everything you're building, where should you intervene to make the biggest difference?

Donella Meadows spent her career studying systems—economies, ecosystems, organizations, cities—and noticing that some interventions work while others backfire spectacularly. Her essay "Leverage Points" offers a counterintuitive claim: the places where change seems easiest are often the places where it matters least. And the places that matter most? We tend to push them in exactly the wrong direction. "Leverage points are not intuitive," she writes. "Or if they are, we intuitively use them backward, systematically worsening whatever problems we are trying to solve."

This should sound familiar. Salvatori told us two weeks ago that difficulty is informational—that the places where reading feels hardest are often the places where understanding is actually possible. Meadows extends the insight to systems more broadly. The places where intervention feels natural are often low-leverage: tweaking parameters, adjusting numbers, making small changes that the system absorbs without fundamentally shifting. The high-leverage points—the rules, the goals, the paradigms—feel harder to touch. But they're where change actually happens.

Meadows offers a vocabulary for understanding how systems work: *stocks* and *flows*. A stock is accumulated material—water in a bathtub, money in a bank account, fragments in a folder. A flow is what increases or decreases the stock—faucet in, drain out; deposits and withdrawals; daily writing and periodic revision. The relationship between them explains why change takes time. "The sluggish response of the water level to what could be sudden twists in the input and output valves is typical," Meadows observes. "It takes time for flows to accumulate in stocks... Policy changes take time to accumulate their effects."

Your corpus is a stock. The fragments you produce each week are the inflow. What you do with them—revising, connecting, eventually publishing—is the outflow. And the accumulation takes time. You can't cram a semester's worth of fragment production into finals week any more than you can fill a bathtub instantly. The stock builds gradually, or it doesn't build at all. This is why we started writing on day one. This is why every class meeting produces text. The flow has to be steady for the stock to grow. In Week 8, we'll encounter another vocabulary for this same insight: Babbage's distinction between the *mill* (where transformation happens) and the *store* (where material accumulates). Flows feed the mill; stocks are the store.

But Meadows's deeper insight is that not all interventions are equal. She ranks twelve leverage points from least to most effective. At the bottom: constants, parameters, numbers—the things we most often adjust. At the top: the goals of the system, and beyond that, the paradigm out of which the system arises. Applied to writing: adjusting your word count target is a low-leverage intervention. Changing your understanding of what writing *is for* is high-leverage. The course has been working at the higher levels—reframing writing as accumulation rather than episodes, as process worth documenting rather than product to be graded, as infrastructure you're building rather than assignments you're completing.

This week introduces Zotero, a citation management tool. At first glance, Zotero looks like a low-leverage intervention—just a way to format bibliographies correctly. But that misses what citation systems actually do. A citation is a *dependency declaration*: this claim relies on that source. Zotero makes those dependencies visible and manageable. It's infrastructure for tracking what your thinking depends on. When your corpus grows to dozens of sources, you'll need a system that remembers what you read, where you read it, and how to find it again. Zotero is that system. Think of it as version control for your intellectual debts.

The connection to Meadows: information flows are a leverage point. Changing the structure of information flows can change behavior without changing physical resources. When you can *see* your dependencies—laid out in a Zotero library, linked to your notes—you can work with them differently than when they're scattered across browser tabs and half-remembered PDFs. The tool doesn't do the thinking for you. It makes the thinking *possible* by handling the routing and retrieval that would otherwise overwhelm your attention.

This week also brings Eli Review Cycle 1—your first formal peer review. The Literacy Narrative you drafted last week now meets readers. The Generous protocol (Summarize, Praise, Question) asks peers to describe what they see before evaluating it. This is a leverage point intervention: changing the *rules* of feedback changes the feedback itself. When the protocol requires summary before judgment, readers have to understand before they critique. That's a structural change, not just an exhortation to "be nice."

Block 4 introduces Spec Document brainstorming—a practice of articulating intentions before drafting. What is this piece supposed to do? For whom? Under what constraints? With what success criteria? A spec document is a leverage point for your own writing: it changes the *goals* of the draft before the draft exists. Instead of discovering your purpose through drafting (which works, but slowly), you articulate purpose first and draft toward it. The spec can change—intentions evolve—but having a spec means you can *notice* when your draft diverges from your intention. That noticing is high-leverage.

We'll return to Meadows's framework explicitly in Week 7, when we pair her ideas with Christopher Alexander's work on design and "goodness of fit." The connection: both are asking where to intervene in complex systems. Meadows asks which leverage points matter most. Alexander asks how you know when an intervention *fits*—when the form you've created actually resolves the tensions it was meant to address. This is Difficulty Pair B, and it's deliberate. Notice where Meadows's hierarchy helps you think about your own writing process. We'll use it.

## Reading

**This Week**: [[meadows-leverage-points-reading-course-v101|Meadows, "Leverage Points: Places to Intervene in a System"]] (~15-20 pages)

**Key Concepts**:
- Leverage points: places where small shifts produce big changes
- Stocks and flows: accumulated material vs. rates of change
- Counterintuitive intervention: we often push leverage points backward
- Hierarchy of effectiveness: parameters (weak) → rules → goals → paradigms (strong)
- Information flows as leverage: changing what's visible changes behavior

**Connection to Activities**: Meadows's stocks/flows vocabulary applies directly to fragment accumulation (corpus as stock, daily writing as flow). Zotero operationalizes information flow management. Spec Documents work at the level of goals. Eli Review protocol changes the rules of feedback.

**Difficulty Pair B**: This reading begins a deliberate pairing with Alexander's "Goodness of Fit" in Week 7. Theme: where and when to intervene in systems. Meadows → which leverage points matter; Alexander → how to know if intervention worked.

**Reading Approach**: Meadows writes accessibly, but the leverage point hierarchy requires careful attention. Don't just read the list—think about *why* she ranks them as she does. What makes some interventions more powerful than others?

### Block Details

#### Block 1: Zotero Basics (Library Session, Part 1)

**Type**: T3

**Duration**: 25 minutes

**Materials**: Computer lab or laptops, Zotero installation guide, sample sources (course readings)

**Location**: Library classroom (if available) or regular classroom with devices

**Opening** (3 min): Frame Zotero as infrastructure, not just formatting tool. "A citation is a dependency declaration—this claim relies on that source. Zotero manages your dependencies so you can focus on thinking."

**Main Activity** (19 min):
- Install Zotero and browser connector (if not pre-installed)
- Create library structure: one collection for ENGL 101
- Add a source manually (demonstrate with course reading)
- Add a source via browser connector (demonstrate with online article)
- Show how Zotero stores full-text PDFs and metadata

**Closing** (3 min): "By end of today, you'll have a working Zotero library with at least 3 sources. Tomorrow we practice using it in your writing."

**Connection**: Introduces [[outcome-workflow-technologies]]; citation as dependency management; information flow as leverage point (Meadows)

---

#### Block 2: Zotero Practice (Library Session, Part 2)

**Type**: T4

**Duration**: 25 minutes

**Materials**: Zotero (installed), course readings, students' prior sources

**Opening** (3 min): Quick troubleshooting—any installation issues from yesterday? Then frame today's goal: "Add sources you've actually used and practice generating citations."

**Main Activity** (18 min):
- Students add 3+ sources to their Zotero library:
  - At least one course reading (Ong, Salvatori, Downs, or Meadows)
  - At least one source from their Literacy Narrative or fragments
  - One new source found via library database
- Practice generating citations in different formats (MLA, APA)
- Practice inserting citations into a Word/Google Doc (if time)

**Closing** (4 min): "Your Zotero library is now part of your infrastructure. Every source you encounter from now on goes here first. The routing is: find source → add to Zotero → then read and take notes. This saves you from 'I read something about this but can't find it' despair."

**Connection**: Operationalizes citation as dependency; supports [[outcome-workflow-technologies]]; prepares for BEAM work in Weeks 6-8

---

#### Block 3: Source-Based Fragment with Zotero Citation

**Type**: W

**Duration**: 25 minutes

**Materials**: Zotero library (populated), Meadows reading, SEAR handout reference

**Opening** (3 min): "You've added sources to Zotero. Now use one. Write a source-based fragment responding to Meadows—use SEAR, and generate your citation from Zotero."

**Main Activity** (19 min): Students write a fragment (~200-300 words) that:
- Engages a specific passage from Meadows
- Uses SEAR structure (Situate, Embed, Analyze, Relate)
- Includes a properly formatted citation generated from Zotero

Circulate to help with Zotero citation insertion and SEAR application.

**Closing** (3 min): Quick share: "What leverage point concept did you engage? Where did Meadows's framework illuminate something about your own writing process?"

**Connection**: Integrates [[outcome-constraint-literacy]] (leverage points) with [[outcome-workflow-technologies]] (Zotero); deepens SEAR practice from Week 4

---

#### Block 4: Spec Document Brainstorming

**Type**: W

**Duration**: 25 minutes

**Materials**: Spec Document template (reference), students' current project ideas

**Opening** (5 min): Introduce the Spec Document concept: "A spec articulates intention before drafting. It answers: What is this piece supposed to do? For whom? Under what constraints? With what success criteria?"

Show example structure (from VIRENS functional spec or simplified version):
```
SPEC DOCUMENT v0.1
Purpose: What should this text accomplish?
Audience: Who will read it? What do they know/need?
Constraints: Requirements, limits, scope boundaries
Success criteria: How will I know if this works?
```

**Main Activity** (17 min): Students draft a spec for their next substantial piece of writing. Options:
- Spec for Literacy Narrative revision (post-Eli Review)
- Spec for upcoming Spec Document assignment (meta!)
- Spec for a fragment collection they want to develop

Emphasis: The spec is a *leverage point intervention*—it changes the goals before drafting begins.

**Closing** (3 min): "Your spec will evolve. That's fine—intentions change as you work. But having a spec means you can *notice* when your draft diverges from your intention. The noticing is the point."

**Connection**: Introduces spec documents as [[outcome-process-documentation]]; connects to Meadows's goals-level intervention; prepares for [[spec-document-assignment-course-v101]] due Week 6

**Note**: Spec Document assignment sheet and template need development. For this session, use simplified structure above.

---

#### Block 5: Eli Review Cycle 1 — Literacy Narrative

**Type**: P

**Duration**: 25 minutes

**Materials**: Eli Review access, Literacy Narrative drafts (submitted prior to class), Cycle 1 criteria

**Opening** (3 min): Frame first formal peer review: "Your Literacy Narrative now meets readers. The Generous protocol asks you to Summarize, Praise, and Question before suggesting changes. This is a leverage point: the *rules* of feedback shape what feedback becomes."

**Main Activity** (19 min): 
- Students log into Eli Review
- Complete 2 peer reviews using Generous (SPQ) protocol:
  - **Summarize**: What is this draft doing? (Describe before judging)
  - **Praise**: What's working? (Specific, with evidence)
  - **Question**: What would you like to know more about? (Curiosity, not critique)
- Reviews should be substantive (150+ words each)

**Closing** (3 min): "Reviews due by [deadline]. Next class, you'll read feedback on your own draft and plan revision. Remember: the feedback tells you what readers *experienced*—that's data about how your text works."

**Connection**: First formal application of [[peer-review-cycle1-literacy-narrative-criteria-course-v101]]; protocol as rules-level intervention (Meadows)

---

#### Block 6: Process Eli Feedback and Revision Planning

**Type**: R

**Duration**: 25 minutes

**Materials**: Eli Review (feedback received), revision planning template, Spec Document drafts

**Opening** (3 min): "You've received feedback. Today's work: process what readers told you and plan your revision. Not all feedback requires action—but all feedback is information about how your text worked for actual readers."

**Main Activity** (18 min):
- Students read feedback on their Literacy Narrative
- Identify patterns: What did multiple readers notice? Where did readers struggle?
- Draft a revision plan:
  - 2-3 specific changes based on feedback
  - Which feedback to act on, which to set aside, and why
  - How revision connects to original spec (if drafted in Block 4)

**Closing** (4 min): Introduce Reflective One-Pager #1: "Due after this cycle—a brief reflection on what you learned from the peer review process. What did giving feedback teach you? What did receiving feedback teach you?"

**Connection**: [[outcome-composing-processes]] (revision as response to readers); [[outcome-process-documentation]] (revision plan as evidence); prepares for Reflective One-Pager #1

---

## Tech Integration

### This Week: Zotero (T3-T4)

**Blocks 1-2**: Library sessions introducing Zotero

**Learning Objectives**:
- Install and configure Zotero with browser connector
- Add sources manually and via web
- Organize sources into collections
- Generate citations in standard formats
- Insert citations into documents

**Framing**: Zotero as dependency management infrastructure. Citation as declaration of what your thinking relies on. Information flow as leverage point.

**By End of Week**: Students should have:
- Functional Zotero installation
- Library with 5+ sources (including course readings)
- Experience generating and inserting citations

### Cumulative Tech Status

| Tool | Status | Function |
|------|--------|----------|
| Index cards | In use | Physical capture |
| OneDrive folders | In use | Digital storage and organization |
| Eli Review | Active (Cycle 1) | Structured peer feedback |
| Dev log | Ongoing | Process documentation |
| Zotero | **Introduced** | Citation management / dependency tracking |

### Documents to Develop

- **Spec Document template**: Simplified version for student use. Current placeholder structure works; formal template needed for Week 6 assignment.

---

## Fragment Production

### This Week's Target

- **Minimum new fragments**: 3-4
- **Source-based (Meadows)**: 1-2 (Block 3)
- **Spec Document drafts**: Count as fragments if substantial
- **Total in-class writing blocks**: 2 (Blocks 3, 4)

### Cumulative Progress

- **Through Week 4**: 12-16 fragments
- **After Week 5**: 16-20 fragments
- **M2 target (by Week 7)**: 20-28 fragments
- **Semester target**: 40-50 by Week 12

### Note on This Week

Tech instruction (Blocks 1-2) and peer review (Blocks 5-6) reduce dedicated writing time. Fragment production continues but at slower pace. This is appropriate—students are building infrastructure (Zotero) and processing feedback (Eli Review) that will accelerate later work.

## Instructor Notes

### Facilitation Tips

- **Zotero installation**: Anticipate technical difficulties. Have backup plan (library computers, partner work) for students whose devices won't cooperate. The goal is functional citation management, not perfect setup.

- **Stocks/flows concreteness**: The bathtub example is memorable. Use it. Draw it on the board. Ask students to identify the stock and flows in their own writing process. Where is material accumulating? What's the inflow rate?

- **Leverage point hierarchy**: Students may resist the idea that some interventions are more powerful than others. That's fine—Meadows herself says the hierarchy is counterintuitive. Let them wrestle with it.

- **Spec Document buy-in**: Some students will find "writing about what you're going to write" frustrating. Frame it as reducing future pain: "The spec saves you from writing 1000 words before realizing you don't know what you're arguing."

- **First Eli Review cycle**: Expect some logistical confusion. Walk through the interface. Emphasize that Generous protocol means describing *before* judging—the summary comes first.

### Flexibility Points

- **Block 3 source**: Students can write about Meadows or any source now in their Zotero library. Flexibility serves different student interests.

- **Block 4 spec target**: Students can spec their Literacy Narrative revision, the upcoming Spec Document assignment, or another project. The practice matters more than the specific target.

- **Zotero depth**: If library sessions run long, Block 3 writing can be shortened. Core goal: working Zotero installation with sources added.

### What's Locked

- **Zotero introduction**: T3-T4 per consolidated schedule. Must happen this week to support BEAM work in Weeks 6-8.
- **Eli Review Cycle 1**: First formal peer review. Protocol and timing locked.
- **Meadows reading**: Anchors Difficulty Pair B. Cannot shift.
- **Reflective One-Pager #1**: Due after Cycle 1 per schedule.

### Evidence to Collect

- Zotero adoption: Are students successfully adding sources and generating citations?
- Leverage point application: Can students identify leverage points in their own writing process?
- Eli Review engagement: Are reviews substantive? Are students following the Generous protocol?
- Spec Document utility: Do students find the spec helpful for clarifying intention?
